# Age restriction of YouTube Videos based on text from closed captions.

## Motivation

This project attempts to annotate and classify Youtube videos taking into account the content of the video and the composition of the text/captions. While youtube flags content inappropriate for young audiences by requiring viewers to sign in, a lot of youtube content is generally unaudited if the uploader of the video does not flag it as appropriate for a particular age group. Also there is no distinction as to what content is appropriate for which age groups. In this project, we will classify content based the film rating system: G, PG, PG-13 and R.
