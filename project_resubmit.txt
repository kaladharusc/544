profane words = [sh*t, pi** off, son of b**ch, b**tard, b*tch]
offensive words = [f**k, pu**y, b**bs, c**t, pe**s, mot***cker, c**k, d*ck]

if no offensive words ( its ok if 1-2 profane words)
	Rate ‘G’

if no offensive words  but found 2-4 profane words in text:
	then read the captions, to understand the context :
		if context was found more of sensual and verbal abuse :
			rate it PG-13
		else:
			rate PG
else if more than 4 profane words but no offensive words:
	rate PG

if one or more offensive words are found in text:
	then read the captions, to understand the context :
		if context was found more of  sexual and has direct verbal abuse and more offensive words than general use:
            Rate 'R'
        else:
            Rate 'PG-13'

if more than 4-5 offensive words :
    rate 'R'


Aim of caption reading is to understand more of the word context from the text. ( i.e the context in which the word is uttered.)
we might add more words to the profane and offensive words list.


Even after this if we are not able to label the video captions of a particular then we are going to watch the video to make a decision.
