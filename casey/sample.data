EXPOSED my video was FAKED    YES
yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  this this is the story of failure  we tried to do something and we failed the facts as to why we failed are  relevant because in the end we failed  this is the behind the scenes of a short movie which if you haven't seen yet  you can see here it's a fantastic movie and what about happiness and success but  underneath that is a lie because we try to do something and we did not succeed  and that failure is not represented in this movie  so this behind the scenes is that story  yeah  so we're taking a quick break here  all right so we got lucky with me what's happening right now  ok so now we filled up we're going to fly another  miles that way and we're  going to pick up the jet ski on a foot long line and sling it into the  icebergs  yeah we're gonna zap strap it just sit down I don't know any of these what the  hell's as abstract as a strapping it's like God his role things that snapped ok  let's hear it  yeah  i think i'm going to go on the grass in front of you and I'll go farther down  Bianca you can go right in front of the truck and I'll take you farther down  well I move the truck and you have all this shit  there's this jet ski buddy Jeff and I didn't hear ya  how to play for help hey no problem good  the helicopters need to lift this also have so  that's if not we've got a  fuckin long waiver  yeah but now we got to get this thing in the sky  quite well what do you think Harry  why not right what's the worst that could happen  Oscar and adjusting for me were like two hours behind schedule and stick it here  it is  yes all the wakeboard a jet he will pull the way for ya  yeah  what's happening  pink the helicopter is spinning in a way that's making Brad uncomfortable she  bring it back down  there  shoot major issues major issues  safety is the most important thing here we don't want to take any chances  so he's bringing it back but i don't know what i don't understand the details  of what's happening  what happened up there that day is way everything  pounds  holy crap what about accounting the other helicopter she doesn't long line  it fucking do that  no its private here's rihanna is a tenthousanddollar fine  this is a pretty critical is a pretty critical situation not sure what the  what the solution is for contemplating getting a different helicopter but  there's no way to even call down there from here  you know I got in reach I could text that Meeker  good it's been about an hour and a half years we decided we've got another  helicopter coming in to lift the jet ski  it's gonna be like an hour to have to get here we're going to up the icebergs  now and shoot everything we need to shoot before the ski gets here from the  ski gets here we can get the money shot and then get out  go up the glacier now we have food  we're waiting for the other helicopter then gonna bring this heat  make it happen  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  so this location  place your legs were  want to do the jet ski  all of this  yeah  crazy about hey everybody oh my god  so the other helicopter with the jets he's gonna be here in about two hours  with that camera  yeah  you know that  search your chamber bells energy verdad next chamber to chamber  all right label boat is ready now it is time for some iceberg connaissez want me  to do this isn't quite as exciting as that  yeah  I think my friend that way  spit up on this year inflatable raft . and now let's check out there are you  can get your package on the week or so we're on the iceberg now not sure what  the plan is or how to get off of here but it's pretty amazing  never have I ever seen an iceberg before the chopper with the jets he should be  here any second  the icebergs moving because I took it as a way to get over here  Oh God  if you're anything like me and you fantasize about climbing around icebergs  it really is that awesome  still waiting on the jet ski not entirely sure when it's coming but i'll  save another hour and a half of sunlight so gonna hang in there it is getting  colder out by the second  but that's okay we're running low on food we're down to our last protein bar  did you eat all the sandwiches and most of them might be one turkey that  jetty and the third helicopter have arrived  i'm going to put on the dry suit it's go time  yes he is working  yeah  yes holy for ya  oh god I stepped in it for one second and my feet  both of my feet have like a brain freeze that's what it feels like I'm ready  I love list of bad ideas  how's it coming over there is the ski working  no I will stay out here is very on this way i can take you in there  yeah  money and get over here driving this was it  this was the moment the singular mission of wakeboarding through icebergs about  to come to fruition  the board was dropped on my feet the ski was ready to go the tow rope was fixed  this was when the moment of realization turned into a moment of failure  yeah  after all of this after all this  Jeff are Jessie driver drove for like two minutes and i think there are rocks  in the intake and the Jets he is not working  I'm ready as ready as I'll ever be to go much more like to have honestly   minutes with the alternative is a helicopter capable of taking you on a  wakeboard get your asses  is there anything else that can tug  k see if the jet ski doesn't work we're supposed to be at work is like the whole  fucking thing about what  you know  fuck  they won't going on here something  fuck this  I got three fire logs left  well you know that's it that is what failure looks like that  yeah    PG-13
I Wrecked a New Mercedes-Benz    NO
so  what is going on here  my ft on the scene  nothing to see here folks move along  monday morning i'm going to the gym today because last night was Game of  Thrones and I need to catch up  by watching it on the Stairmaster at the reflection in these glasses with it you  can see my you can see my iphone  yeah  done Jimin great episode of Game of Thrones home shower dress work  go go go  I slept nine hours last night that was coming off of a hour no sleep  bender I feel like a completely different person today  it's like I'm on drugs right way to start the week  today's monday so i wanted to spend today's vlog doing another behind the  scenes and that's where I like break down an old movie i had made and tell  the stories about like how it came to be and what happened behind it but i was  looking through my archives here trying to find some footage to support the  behind the scenes that I wanted to do today  I found something that's really awesome  it stars a very drunk Candace my now wife who  years ago it's just some  baby I was not a hot date with and it's at like four in the morning and we're  leaving a bar or something i don't remember what happened was my older  brother Dan's bike had been stolen a few days earlier  we're in the same neighborhood which is alphabet city  I saw these like four dudes leaning up against the wall hanging out and they  had vans bike so I gave Candace my camera  I gave her my backpack and I remember saying to her whatever happens do not  try to help me just call the police if the shit goes down  what happened and she didn't do a very good job of capturing this case she's  busy filming herself  what happened is I just rolled up on these four guys and they're like big  thugs and I was like a  year old and I just like I remember like being like  blind confidence Casey overwhelm them with confidence make these four dudes  fear you and I just like rolled up this clenched and like stared into their eyes  like a glaring eye contact and then I grab the bike put on my shoulder never  broke eye contact and walked away  ok here's the video see  that he saw his hands like fans but I got stolen last night everything to  seize it  are you fucking kidding me he's got it  and  this is like is that then how do you know it is thats a license plate  yeah that's that's Van Slyke  all right back to you behind the scenes which I'm totally pumped to do today  today's gonna be an awesome behind the scenes because these are kind of stories  I've never told before this behind the scenes is going to be about a campaign I  did which was three four four four separate videos i did for mercedesbenz  and this one I want to say this was i want to say likeok let me just put it on runs on there  the mercedesbenz CLA project was a advertising campaign about this car  which is the mercedesbenz CLA I got this campaign with them and it was to  make for videos so there was never any storyboards any script any outlines  there's nothing specific  it was all kept incredibly broad which was a really big deal for me especially  then  because I didn't have the audience then that I have now this was by far the  biggest dollar ad campaign I'd ever done it was enough money to enable us to do  whatever we wanted to do like no matter how crazy the idea we would have the  budget for it  the first part this video here this is a little background  why like mercedesbenz I happen to drive a Mercedes at the time I did this  campaign my history with them  cool little video shot most of it here in the studio and it ended on a really  kickass note which was them dropping off a prototype CLA  so we're like the first people to have one ok whatever it is part two  Oscar and I was like my best friend he's also like a producer and a filmmaker so  Oscar i traveled to Germany  and all we brought with this was like skateboards and a couple cameras and we  went to the mercedesbenz museum and we went to like their car factory and we  have to drive all kinds of like crazy soupedup prototypes  ok part  this is by far my favorite video of the for video campaign  it's playing here the narrative of this video goes like this  it shows us starting to do the shoot in New York City with this beautiful girl  and then it starts to pour out so we shift gears and we fly to the bonneville  salt flats in New Mexico Arizona New Mexico Nevada  that's not how it went down what actually happened  this is where it gets fun is we went to the Bonneville Salt Flats first and we  had this whole enormous shoot scheduled and organized for out there  we had a helicopter and airplane for stunts cop cars we had stunt drivers but  it was all predicated on the fact that we had a beautiful functioning  mercedesbenz CLA to shoot  so we went out the night before the shoot to do some testing and I like I  wrecked the car know that this was like a handmade prototype that was just made  to be like pushed on the showroom floor is wearing white gloves it was not even  really meant to be driven  we had to cancel the entire shoot the next day and we basically left with what  was like a garbage pile of footage and we looked at that footage and were like  this isn't we don't have a movie there's not enough here so that was what I was  like okay we need to do another shoot and Mercedes was super super cool  they got us another car and then we did the second part of the shoot in New York  City  they wanted something authentic and real and something that felt true not  manufactured  so the only way your auntie I was to constantly put us in harm's way where  things would definitely go wrong and then whatever the outcome  was would be our video and that was sort of the thesis behind the campaign and  everything else I did Oscar today I'm doing behind the scenes of the CLA  project  all right what details did I leave out  did you talk about what happened to fucking paper and i talked about how he  broke the car yeah and the self lat  the car was destroyed on my birthday  biggest production nightmares ever had to deal with i was trying to have fun  and everything that we planned out went to shit immediately  first place to destroy the car no spam it wasn't anybody else  don't let him just don't say anything a little bit  I completely wrecked the car and Oscar had to deal with all the river cut using  all the hard work at all I was doing was screwing it up and it was my birthday  it is you with that  that video turned out being my favorite it was the most accidental which made it  the most real which made it just amazing video for was the actual commercial  it's one minute long so it actually aunt Edie and you can click and watch it here  I worked with my friend game was like a really smart writer and I was like Gabe  I just want there to be like a single message here to encapsulate all the  ethos behind this entire project that we did which i think is in line with the  ethos behind the actual car that Mercedes is trying to sell  sometimes in life you just have to say it and we literally made the commercial  that says sometimes in life you just have to say it and now I knew that  couldn't be shown on TV  I still short of mercedes though so we ended up saying sometimes in life you  just have to say yes which is probably even better because it's like more  positive and people could misconstrue what it actually means  that's it Oh what one more interesting too that this literally hurts my be able  to admit this someone's ooh min to make it even more serious  so for the last video I knew is gonna be more of like a crazy music video montage  situation then like a real narrative  so the song was everything now this is like three years ago but i just learned  about this like australian girl rapper named AE Azalea  I wanted her to play the babe was like driving the car with me in the car  behind it and I wanted to use her song work now we happen to have like the same  agent represents us or same agency or whatever is where we'll be in touch with  her and she was totally down to do it for a fee that was completely reasonable  it's a higher now be millions and millions and  of dollars but nobody who she was then and mercedesbenz said no they didn't  think she was gonna be a big deal and they thought that she might be a  liability  I'm believable anyways okay all right  that's why behind the scenes of the mercedesbenz CLA project  links to all those movies below just quick disclaimer  mercedesbenz doesn't know that i made this behind the scenes where there are  disclosing this information on my youtube channel so none of this is  endorsed I don't think it'd be mad at me for saying this stuff but i will say  that working with them was really super awesome  ok that's it    PG-13
