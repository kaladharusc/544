00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,579
for samsung to take some 360 photos and

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,399
they always entertain my stupidest ideas

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,339
this morning might be my stupidest best

10
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,640
worst idea ever

11
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:07,500
morning guys maybe it's too early for

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,710
remember the helicopter that that flew

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:17,880
us to visit on video sensors picked us

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:24,180
up on the tarmac that is a we only role

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:27,360
as Cedric we are a lot of properties to

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,009
do things are just getting started

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,909
who's excited I'm excited are you

18
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:40,320
excited excited excited hired as a rope

19
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:45,659
ladder hanging out with your name on it

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,510
you'll be sitting like this

21
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,580
ok when we decide and then the lateral

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,050
drop-down obviously like that so you'll

23
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,260
climb out

24
00:01:52,050 --> 00:02:01,240
ok now the next the first rung of the

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:04,479
ladder

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,600
so this is like safety stuff rigging

27
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,569
stuff practice like working out all the

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,910
details so we actually do this there's a

29
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,239
lady did we want to remove as many

30
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:25,030
variables as possible safety is the key

31
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:43,330
that the business services got my

32
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:46,300
harness time here feels pretty good

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,880

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,500

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,330
entire army necks

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,580
how do we turn this into a boat i think

37
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,590
now we don't figure out a time just like

38
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,900
this yeah this is per case you want to

39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,840
squish this squid boat i would just made

40
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,120
out of wedding and did this is perfect

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,980

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,760

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,860
enough this string here is going to tie

45
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,880
my sunglasses before I find out of the

46
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,860
helicopter think that's it

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,110
if we have a problem Jake is going to

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,270

49
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:31,180
away to let me know right away and we'll

50
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:32,530
just deal with it

51
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,420
I don't know if I've been a hundred

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,159
percent clear on why we're doing all of

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,379
this very moral literally just so i can

54
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,180
take a picture with a gear 360 i just

55
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,950
wanted to be a really good picture so I

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,019
kept like upping the ante of what we

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,040
should do until we arrived at this place

58
00:03:44,019 --> 00:05:34,710
so all of this is literally 41 364 I

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:05:39,840
hope it's a good picture

60
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:43,050
