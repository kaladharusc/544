three minutes this is one of my favorite

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,220
hotels where you walk into the coolest

91
00:06:33,970 --> 00:07:09,289
it's like red carpeting and then a green

92
00:06:36,220 --> 00:07:15,020
stripe ceiling it's very old school

93
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:27,619
I mean it's the coolest I'm ready

94
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:31,219

00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:36,439
to you with your honor

97
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,149

days you're gonna like run back into the

99
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:42,770

00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,089
my samsung gear 360

101
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,580
well the project that I'm supposed to be

102
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,770
doing out here in la is like taking dope

103
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,379
360 photos with this it's not really a

104
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,089
for samsung like a branded thing with

105
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,319
Samsung and when they asked if they

106

is what they did yeah that's like that

110
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,809
