sorry headphone users alright so guys we

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,250
did a little digging on your Twitter

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,990
accounts whoops we pulled up some old

26
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,780
strange strange stuff so each of you

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,490
will be presented with a tweet that you

28
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,679
have posted with a couple key words

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,619
missing your goal is to guess what's in

30
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:59,689
those blank spaces if you get it right

31
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,209
you get five points if you don't get it

32
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,850
right then you get no points because you

33
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:19,420
didn't do anything

34
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,829
all right let's do the first one yeah

35

the hell honestly it still applies

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,549
probably trying to think of how many

39
00:02:46,549 --> 00:03:07,910
characters that would be okay that's for

40
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:20,180

46
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,740

47
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,530
was gonna drop it into that Blake to

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,120
whoever's making the screenshots is not

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,540
following Steve I actually remember

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,490
making this because there was a little

51
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,580
bit of controversy after I posted this

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,190
tweet from a good friend who had just

53
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,940
had a baby

54
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,030
yeah and I made you hold it I made me

55
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,609
hold it and she was really scared after

56
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:21,230
that so I think it's trash can oh is it
