1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,419
sir-sir

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,990
hmm if you don't bug me asking where did

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,080
you get those apples everyone everywhere

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,139
apples longer there those are the

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,210
inhabitants of the Apple planet those

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,210
are the Apple people's are oh that's why

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:27,760
do you scream

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,930
we've been through a lot together on

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,190
this intergalactic journey through the

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,780
game's a yester light gear and we've

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,880
seen a lot too but the fact remains

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,860
there are just too many Star Wars games

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,210
out there to cover in a timely fashion

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,370
why don't we take a few quick looks at

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,660
some of the more interesting and notable

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,710
games out there that may have been

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,660
unassuming at first glance if you

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,400
remember early on I covered Star Wars

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,110
x-wing but did you know they also made a

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,390
spiritual successor to that game they

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,770
didn't go in the direction you may have

22
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,559
expected though this is Star Wars TIE

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,660
fighter for the first time you got to

24
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,660
play as the bad guys that's badass dude

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,480
I want to embrace my inner dark side I

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,759
want to look and feel the part I want to

27
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,250
go on the way no okay this now this

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,780
didn't work let's I'm gonna take this

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,670
off now it's kind of like Flags of Our

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,830
Fathers and letters from iwo jima if you

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,960
played both x-wing and TIE fighter you

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,580
got to see both sides of the story a

33
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,320
combat and gameplay are pretty much the

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,910
same as last time the biggest difference

35
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,710
is that everything is Empire theme art

36
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,180
music this time around we're pretty

37
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,280
extraordinary - definitely felt like you

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,530
were part of the Empire

39
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,230
I have come with an offer for the

40
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,140
rebellion we have little reason to trust

41
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,780
you at Mohawk oh yes especially because

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,160

43
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,290
meeting dressed as Count Dracula hey

44

you're getting a little too snuggly and

47
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,580
your Snuggie over there what kind of

48
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,140

49
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,910
anyways what's coming back next the

50
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,640
Anakin Skywalker bowl haircut am i can

we've made to the tie advance yes it

53
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,210
does appear they can still bomb things

54
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,840
sitting still most impressive

55
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,209
Admiral throne I am promoting you to

56
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,180
Grand Admiral for your immediate service

57
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,030
to the Empire do you know how hard it

58
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,890
was to line up this meeting with a dark

59
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,730
thunderstorm

60
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,190
I've been going to weather.com every day

61
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,570
for like two weeks

62
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,300
I think the sights gave me malware next

63
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,160
up Star Wars behind the magic an

64
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,020
interactive cd-rom that was developed to

65
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,610
be an in-depth look behind the scenes at

66
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,709
the original trilogy it's got glossaries

67
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,840
galore for example here's a page on

68
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,150
weapons from the Star Wars universe

69
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,890
weapons tests huh what's going on in

70
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,739
there oh hello mr. stormtrooper you're

71
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,840
looking conspicuously in the center of

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,410
attention

73
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,080
now what are these Ewok Rock yeah that's

74
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,430
my favorite genre 200l I thought it was

75
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,140
just gonna be an enjoyable concert with

76
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,670
furry midgets holy crap wow what

77
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,709
educational value and well they have a

78
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,150
good point you know I mean how else

79
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,380
would you know your weapons were

80
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,269
functional I don't worry dude I just

81
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,200
want to make sure everything's working

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,830
correctly okay yeah we're good it work

83
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,220
come on get up quit being such a baby

84
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,230
Death Star Rey oh my god that's a bit

85
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:29,090
overkill isn't it

86
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,520
oh come on what a cop-out they made me

87
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,590
sit here and watch this poor man's quiet

88
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,300
desperation I'm watching him pray his

89
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,530
final thoughts they won't even give me

90
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,170
the payload listen I just wanted to see

91
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,940
them the guy blow up okay

92
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,980
I'm not the crazy one I just want to see

93
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,810
his legs come off and his eyes come off

94
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,780
oh yeah that's the good stuff

95
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,000
then we have Star Wars demolition this

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,739
was Lucas arts his take on the twisted

97
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,900
metal vehicular gladiator formula it's

98
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,280
definitely one of the more oddball

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,290
offerings it's got one of those cool in

100
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,060
World menus that actually take place in

101
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,830
a setting like Conker's Bad Fur Day or

102
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,200
something I don't really know what it is

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,610
you're laughing at but okay see you

104
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,200
later then you can pick from all sorts

105
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,340
of different characters that have their

106
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,720
own vehicle pretty much what you'd

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,489
expect from a game like this except it's

108
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,769
Star Wars which makes it automatically

109
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,540
better I honestly wouldn't complain if

110
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,130
they remade this for current times it

111
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,750
would work but let's not beat around the

112
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,700
bush okay we all know why we're here

113
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,860
it's to watch Boba Fett's little baby

114
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,540
legs dangle around while you play the

115
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,350
game here and there to and fro Boba's

116
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,710
legs will surely go also there's a

117
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,270
Gungan chess board level where there's a

118
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,789
bunch of jar-jar binks heads on giant

119
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:43,820
stones it's a bit of a Easter Island for

120
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,500
your greatest Ganga fan all right you

121
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,210
know who you are stand up don't stand up

122
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,940
sit back down and now the one you've all

123
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,080
been waiting for

124
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,660
Star Wars masters of the Terrence

125
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,229
Terrence terror Theresa cube what's in a

126
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,360
name huh this is one of the most

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
universally panned Star Wars games in

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,520
the universe ours and theirs although I

129
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,320
suppose they're technically the same

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
what don't worry about it personally I

131
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,530
don't get the hate behind this one I

132
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,630
think it's pretty awesome any game in

133
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,100
which you can make Luke Skywalker not

134
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,020
figuratively but literally fight himself

135
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,970
is a game that's okay by me

136
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,159
No

137
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,369
skywalk when readies there's a decent

138
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:22,869
spread of characters but it seems that

139
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,709
some are more overpowered than others

140
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,119
these guys really must have partaken and

141
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,559
some true resistance training to eat

142
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,739
that many lightsabers to the face seems

143
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:34,539
to follow similar rules to tekken or

144
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,080
something

145
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,909
so the lightsaber functions closer to a

146
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,709
wiffle ball bat than a laser sword

147
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,659
that's probably part of the reason this

148
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,569
game was so poorly received is that

149
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,459
really a fair fight come on Han didn't

150
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,529
chew I ever tell you not to bring a fist

151
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,519
to a sword fight ya dumbass relax no

152
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,269
problem

153
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:58,059
Darth Vader versus or whoa okay well

154
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:00,219
just uh make sure you use protection

155
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,379
then while we're at it how about a look

156
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,610
at some of the more old fashioned

157
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,679
merchandise this is what's known as the

158
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,899
Millennium Falcon playset a thing that

159
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,300
literally only a crazy person would want

160
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,369
to use this thing you basically just

161
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,050
strap it onto your keyboard and Rock

162
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,819
Chewbacca and Han Solo back and forth

163
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,169
like you're trying to jerk off a badger

164
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,849
when you push down on one of the

165
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,469
characters it pushes all the way through

166
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:21,699
the device and hits a key on your

167
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,860
keyboard so essentially it's just a very

168
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,959
complicated way to push buttons on your

169
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,569
keyboard as for the software it comes

170
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,309
with if you could call it that it's just

171
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:31,899
like a dragon's lair type thing that

172
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,189
uses footage from the real movies very

173
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:43,479
compelling in the regime but what about

174
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,819
you know regular old merch not bundled

175
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,529
with software what do they call that

176
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:50,559
again oh yeah toys fancy yourself George

177
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,659
Lucas as good guy how about George

178
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,990
Lucas's bad guy George Lucas as family

179
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,339
all hate all bite it's George Lucas's

180
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,949
actual family as Star Wars characters

181
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,740
you can't make that up there are some

182
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,389
things in life that aren't meant to be

183
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,149
questioned just absorbed admired savored

184
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,699
and cherished this is one of those

185
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,919
things you know you can't hold back your

186
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,250
true feelings for me me

187
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,140
but what about all you aspiring Jedi out

188
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,700
there what can you use to hone your

189
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,370
skills well the star wars force trainer

190
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,250
of course except you can't because it

191
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,620
doesn't work ever but it does make you

192
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,970
look like a total jack off so at least

193
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,140
that's one point out of ten

194
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,120
what's this I've got here the Death Star

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,400
right obvious but what if I told you

196
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,250
it's actually Darth Vader and hiding

197
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,680
impossible you say oh but how wrong you

198
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,080
are I think you must have seen Lady Gaga

199
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,420
on TV and just decided to go for it

200
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,150
han and chewie to the rescue watching

201
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,610
off be amazed as Han Solo transforms

202
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,850
into a slice of pizza and Chewie

203
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,730
transforms into a pita bread sandwich

204
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,280
lad uh-oh you got to snap them together

205
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,960
there you go bloody a falcon there it is

206
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,680
and so here we are we've seen pretty

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,320
much everything there is to see I guess

208
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,650
we're done right you didn't think I'd

209
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,590
forget did you

210
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,490
we've been spending a lot of time

211
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,380
looking at the worst and weirdest but

212
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,360
I'll never forget the times I had with

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,830
some of the greatest Star Wars games

214
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,840
they games I've ever played

215
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,980
things like Star Wars Battlefront

216
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,900
Knights of the Old Republic Rogue

217
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,210
Squadron and even Lego Star Wars but

218
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,710
that's what we all love about the brand

219
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,360
isn't it that's why I was able to sit

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,919
here and endlessly talk on and on about

221
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,990
this magical franchise at the end of the

222
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,270
day Star Wars is an open book there's so

223
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,070
much fun to be had in the universe in so

224
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,410
many depths to plunge the ride doesn't

225

226
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,910
spread across the universe in the hearts

227
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,250
of many it's more than a film a game or

228
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,470

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,530
actually move your cursor manually over

240
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,730
to one of the panels on the bottom of

241
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,920
the screen and then hit your action

242
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,170

can literally buy for your keychain

253
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,640
perhaps they were trying to emulate

254
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,470
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

255
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,780

264
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,530

265
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,540
Jerusalem level where c-3po has to

266

277
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,760
pine for the days before the death star

278
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,140
exploded they even used to have a

279
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:14,769
lightsaber section

280
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:18,350
this game is so pet c-3po and r2 just

281
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,759

282
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,800
whole time and move with the two frames

283
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,199
they were graced with and done Threepio

284
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,319
I can't even do this for you this box

285
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,970
art looks familiar though where have I

286
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,759
seen it before oh no master Jon you

287
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,329
mustn't ask what do you mean where's it

288
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:35,899
from

289
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,389
it's been buried my capacitors girl

290
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,160
think even to think of it there's only

291
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,139
one man left in the galaxy that knows

292
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,790
its whereabouts I'm talking of course

293
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,129
about the most dreadful piece of stores

294
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,559
content in the entire galaxy okay have

295
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,670
you seen some of the stuff I've been

296
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,649
sitting here playing and I'll believe

297
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,569
that when I see it with my own eyes it's

298
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,369
not an interactive piece of software

299
00:11:55,369 --> 00:12:04,570
more so Jon it's it's much much worse

300
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:12,000
you
