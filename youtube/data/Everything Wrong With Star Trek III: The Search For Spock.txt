1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:13,030
don't wave at me previously on Star Trek

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,369
and always shall be this is a great

3
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,320
scene in Star Trek 2 but Spock did not

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,880
do the live long and prosper sign until

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,020
actually saying live long and prosper

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,970
also the first two minutes of this movie

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,410
are literally footage from the previous

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,699
movie Jesus made the final frontier

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,800
whisper narration more than two minutes

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,059
of cloud and space credits that do

11
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:33,410
nothing for nobody if the movie is

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,910
directed by spot then that takes all the

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,350
fun out of trying to find Spock the

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,470
death of Spock is like an open wound it

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,519
was a dark and stormy night

16
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:42,920
your timing is excellent mr. Scott you

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,330
fixed the barn door after the horses

18
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,280
come home well that's a dickheaded thing

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,720
to say especially over the old ship

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,250
radio you think Scotty doesn't know this

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,100
already ass a tweak sir but you don't

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,720
have a tweak so I'll do it funny into

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,879
well that was easy hey everybody it's

24
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:56,750
Christopher Lloyd

25
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,000
you know from taxi the Klingons keep our

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,860
us as pets proving once and for all that

27
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,420
the Princess Bride and Star Trek take

28
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,920
place in a shared universe this is

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,510
basically a space 8-track which only

30
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,950
makes sense if the movie is made in an

31
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,270
era where eight tracks are still a thing

32
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,250
which it was so still sending the

33
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,899
8-track Ness of it all this whole ship

34
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,579
appears to explode but the people here

35
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,049
get to chill like nothing's happened for

36
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,340
a split second before the explosion

37
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,009
reaches them on in HD you can totally

38
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,570
see the slightly lighter background box

39
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,219
behind the enterprise as it passes over

40
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,659
this planet never notice that until I

41
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,159
intentionally nitpick this movie for

42
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,600
YouTube which suggests it's still

43
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,770
probably pretty good effects for its

44
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,570
time still sending it because I have a

45
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,369
sin counter to pad you know space porn

46
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:32,899
that could double as a sex ed video

47
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:35,030
hey it's Excelsior Sulu's future ship

48
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,920
from undiscovered country meet my

49
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,460
friends the great experiment um that

50
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,869
experiment works and it saves your ass

51
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,880
three movies from now but scoff all you

52
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,520
want old-timer I

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,979
and if my grandmother had a wheel she'd

54
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,290
be a wagon but wouldn't she though ya

55
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,909
better go check that alone you're only

56
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:53,470
the captain of this ship those two

57
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,430
officers didn't sign up for this

58
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,850
Enterprise is 20 years old Jesus they

59
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,259
let that thing fly around for 20 years

60
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,549
and the crew was complaining about

61
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,409
retiring it I mean I'm on the side of

62
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,080
Starfleet here in your absence Genesis

63
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,539
has become a galactic controversy you

64
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:10,000
are all under orders not to discuss with

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,209
anyone your knowledge of Genesis this is

66
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,260
something we could have told you long

67
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,000
before you got back but it feels better

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,380
doing it now after you could have

69
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,910
violated the policy already you running

70
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,739
on that on the Genesis device I get that

71
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,299
the chicken that earlier scene stole and

72
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,040
gave them this my question is when did

73
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,420
Kirk find the time to record himself

74
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,890
speaking authoritative Leon Genesis

75
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,569
since the last movie the only answer is

76
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,160
the flight home to earth but then I

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,930
counter with why isn't dr. Marcus making

78
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,730
this video lose this video you've made

79
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,560
for I make a video of information you

80
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,150
are going to personally deliver in hours

81
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,319
when you get back to earth wouldn't I

82
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,700
already have the Carol Marcus explainer

83
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,080
video about it from the ratha Khan I

84
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,430
guess my point is this is one of the

85
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,470
most expositional use only videos to

86
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,239
ever appear in a movie instead of a dead

87
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,209
moon a living breathing planet now

88
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,459
exists with no warmth or energy from a

89
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,709
nearby Sun we also generate 10 double

90
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,120
doors in order to sustain a life on the

91
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,320
planet this is where the fun begins

92
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,720
attic that is not Saavik couldn't you at

93
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,190
least pick the metrics that Eaton kind

94
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,320
of resembles Kirstie Alley sector 2

95
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,450
indicating desert terrain minimal

96
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,850
vegetation but why the Genesis project

97
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,109
creates life out of nothing

98
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,280
how would that include a desert with

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
minimal vegetation cross-referenced and

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,350
verified an unidentifiable life-form

101
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,450
reading do you even hear yourself

102
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,190
speaking that incongruous sentence

103
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,799
verified unidentifiable readings why

104
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,239
don't we beam it up yeah sure you're an

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,280
unidentifiable life-form why not luckily

106
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,900
the captain is hilariously and obviously

107
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,340
by-the-book so this idea is not

108
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,410
entertained ahora has a ravioli ring

109
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,900
well few that search for Spock didn't

110
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,590
take long and well spot trusted you and

111
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,350
you denied him his future Spock's dad

112
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,940
the audience everyone in the universe

113
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,410
except for Kirk seems to realize the

114
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,239
Genesis planet would revive Spa mine

115
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,889
melding just got a whole lot sexier oh

116
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,530
yeah Sarek is getting more free homemade

117
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,239
porn right now with green aliens than I

118
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,739
ever will even after seeing bones

119
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,359
literally say things Spock would say

120
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,919
after breaking into Spock's quarters

121
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,989
then hearing about Vulcans mind melding

122
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,070
with someone before they died

123
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,570
Kirk still doesn't make the connection

124
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,110
that Spock's

125
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,030
essence is inside bones yes he wonders

126
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,500
aloud his Spock joined with someone else

127
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,120
and goes to check the video but he

128
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,070
should know its bones instantly no man

129
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,300
it's insane how many angles the

130
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,680
enterprise was recording the throne

131
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,070
right

132
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,430
it's almost cinematic repeat and augment

133
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,650
augment what's the Starfleet Jurgen

134
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,970
version of the zoom and enhance cliche

135
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,190
exercise caution lieutenant when the sky

136
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,810
retires he'll be decorated as the most

137
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,519
careful captain Starfleet ever produced

138
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,830
there are life-forms these were microbes

139
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,750
on the tube surface microbes by their

140
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,550
very definition are microscopic living

141
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,230
organisms I hate to be nitpicking but

142
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,880
these seem way more visible without a

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,950
microscope than usual also mmm

144
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,140
unexplained alien space ravioli and the

145
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,970
search for Spock has n touch and

146
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,010
microbes got our hopes up gen Ewell in

147
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,890
life and your career stand for

148
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,120
rationality not for intellectual chaos

149
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,370
so this asshole just described the

150
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,960
opposite of what Jim Kirk's career has

151
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,400
stood for no one will be seated during

152
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,960
the Spock McCoy hybrid goes to the bar

153
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,610
scene this videogame is clearly stupid

154
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,630
there I said it

155
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,419
how soon is now Star Trek character

156
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,070
inspires the most popular song the

157
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,960
Smiths ever produced McCoy is basically

158
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,610
Spock at this point but only the secrets

159
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,900
of the Vulcan nerve pinch didn't

160
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,370
transfer for some reason I guess the

161
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,320
reason is comic relief but still no one

162
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,370
pulls a punch better than William

163
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,389
goddamn Shatner

164
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,889
yes let's put away that amazing super

165
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,690
useful Destructoid gizmo and never use

166
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,920
it again in the future history of our

167
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,270
adventures board of Kirk and Sulu

168
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,770
breaking bones out of prison should be

169
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,389
all over Starfleet at this point and the

170
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,380
enterprise the number one search

171
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,389
location but these simple facts will not

172
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,830
get in the way of the plot also a movie

173
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,060
will make it seem like hijacking and

174
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,410
piloting a Starfleet vessel with a

175
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,150
handful of people is easy even though

176
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,440
star trek into darkness would have us

177
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,030
believe it takes a superhuman brain to

178
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,470
create a super ship that is top-secret

179
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,210
and oh my god what have I become the

180
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,440
ship should need more people to operate

181
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,510
it's all in a descent a chimpanzee and

182
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,940
two trainees good okay first of all

183
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,350
that's racist against chips and

184
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,180
Starfleet trainees second of all why

185
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,650
does any starship go out with a crew of

186
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,970
hundreds if they're this easy to run

187
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,620
with six people third of all is that

188
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,270
velvet this captain is clearly not

189
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,250
captain material this mother files as

190
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,980
nails excelsior powering up waters to

191
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,960
pursue because we the rogue stolen ship

192
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,910
can still see Starfleet ship status and

193
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,919
active orders naturally I had no clue

194
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,390
what Scotty did to override Starfleet's

195
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,430
lockdown on the space doors all we saw

196
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,110
was Scotty and Kirk looking hopefully at

197
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,490
them I'm simply going to assume the

198
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,320
reason they open is bull movement also

199
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,430
if they have that kind of control over

200
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,750
the space doors they should be able to

201
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,190
close it behind them and make sure that

202
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,870
faster better ship doesn't follow them

203
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,020
even if Scotty sabotage the other ship

204
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,860
thank God for the plot of this movie

205
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,660
that these were the only two starships

206
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,550
anywhere in this area as usual hey

207
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,210
doctor souvenirs from one surgeon to

208
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,130
another all that stuff my stole from the

209
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,930
other ships transwarp Drive I have them

210
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,100
right here for you to look at because

211
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,260
that's one best speed to Genesis even

212
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,490
though that prison break was a kind of

213
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,470
unseen it's taken nearly 50 minutes for

214
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,940
the enterprise to finally Star Trek 3

215
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,890
this unclothed child should probably be

216
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,530
a dead Spock sickled Captain Spock okay

217
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,850
I need you to go through his whole range

218
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,130
of emotions here and perfect all the

219
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,810
same I'm going to advise Starfleet and

220
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,580
get instructions I need to pad my most

221
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,289
cautious captain statistics in time for

222
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,610
the whispering rose awards banquet

223
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,200
captain Buford won last year and by God

224
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,600
he will not get a second

225
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,220
the moral of this story is stop being so

226
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,630
goddamn careful all the time you might

227
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,250
get blown up by a surprise Klingon ship

228
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,790
run by docker protomatter an unstable

229
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,100
substance which every ethical scientist

230
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,860
in the galaxy has denounces dangerously

231
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,930
unpredictable yeah but if we're talking

232
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,520
about the creation of life on desolate

233
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,229
planets anyway where is the ethics line

234
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,610
drawn we're gonna have to shame Kirk's

235
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,080
kid for breaking the rules on a project

236
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,250
like this sin

237
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,199
captain Esteban my compliments but make

238
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,610
sure to do it in a careful manner you'll

239
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:33,630
like that this goes on for some time now

240
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,710
that we've cloaked here's a shot of

241
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,440
Krug's dog for no reason what do I find

242
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,090
weakly human a Vulcan boy and a woman

243
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,340
that's racist three times Federation

244
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,620
starship approaching bring me up

245
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,300
how come a bird of prey Klingon ship

246
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,100
can't fire while cloaked at least until

247
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,690
undiscovered country but it can beam

248
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,250
people in and out while cloaked it's

249
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,320
always bugged me there that distortion

250
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,240
see it and Kirk just made cloaking

251
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,070
technology obsolete or else it was never

252
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,449
very good to begin with or else no one

253
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,889
prior to Kirk bother to use their eyes

254
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,139
instead of the sensors no shield my

255
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,340
guess is right they'll have to decloak

256
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,020
before they can fire yeah but why can't

257
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,030
you raise your shields and fire have I

258
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,380
not seen countless Star Trek's where

259
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,430
they had their shields up and we're

260
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,020
still able to shoot enemy ships I mean

261
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,970
the and despite giving their full power

262
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,710
to the weapons systems two torpedoes

263
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,139
don't destroy the Klingon ship at all

264
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,430
the shield's non-responsive the

265
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,620
automation systems overloaded I didn't

266
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,389
expect to take a center combat you know

267
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,070
oh come on you couldn't bring this up

268
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,450
until now where were your concerns

269
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,800
before this happened and what a bunch of

270
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,630
bulls to create artificial conflict also

271
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,430
the shield is non-responsive but can't

272
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,229
you still fire some torpedoes or is

273
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,150
automation overload code for we can't do

274
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,349
anymore

275
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,289
Kirk survives this uh-huh just huh hey I

276
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,550
don't know why we didn't bring some sort

277
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,080
of blaster with us down here so a knife

278
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,610
will have to do I guess I can't see how

279
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,089
anything could go wrong oh no something

280
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,029
went wrong well at least they got the

281
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,560
one out of the three that isn't integral

282
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,320
to the plot turn on passage you kill my

283
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,070
son

284
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,600
you knew him for like two hours don't

285
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,420
get all dramatic about it come on fast

286
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,459
oh yeah I forgot that's racist

287
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,600
Yes Doctor sequence two code one 1a I

288
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,100
love how these assholes have working

289
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,540
self destruct codes for a decommissioned

290
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,310
ship that King stole from space dock

291
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,740
awaiting final code for one-minute

292
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,720
countdown code zero zero zero so

293
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,980
basically the final self-destruct

294
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,110
password for enterprise is password then

295
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,880
in transporter Bay's really handle this

296
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,650
kind of complex multiple asshole beaming

297
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,300
especially since the ship was just hit

298
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,380
and apparently has very little power

299
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,850
this feels like a new level of bull

300
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,650
eaten for transporter beams I for one am

301
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,760
glad that the enterprise is

302
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,140
self-destruct sequence allows for the

303
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,850
cinematically pleasing throwing of fools

304
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,140
into the air before the whole ship

305
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,910
explodes Enterprise wreckage just tells

306
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,959
me they'll find a way to rebuild this

307
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,670
for the next movie which is about Wales

308
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,839
by the way puberty strength what

309
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,270
happened he gave his life to save us

310
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,850
space Jesus son of Kirk Star Trek 3

311
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,770
really loved mauve or really love

312
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,329
washing White Star Fleet tops in the

313
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,459
same load as Red Star Fleet pants one of

314
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,540
the two and that is some Lion King level

315
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,100
Rock movement right there and krug

316
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,600
didn't even need to sing us off this

317
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,490
planet created by an artificial god-like

318
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,200
substance is playing the deus ex machina

319
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,470
to perfection during this fight see

320
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,649
falling sideways mom

321
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,779
- luckily beam me up is the only Klingon

322
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,250
Kirk knows needs to work on the

323
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,540
Christopher Lloyd impression but he

324
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,860
probably knew malts wouldn't ask

325
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,570
questions about that oh yeah aura - mad

326
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,070
you had to sit this one out for some

327
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,630
reason good job being here on Vulcan at

328
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,589
the end for a celebratory Hut without

329
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:40,970
any explanations or conversations

330
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,560
beforehand they just dragged Spock into

331
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,329
this funeral ceremony not briefing bones

332
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,010
on what he might have to do for Spock to

333
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,839
keep Spock a lot or any kind of Spock

334
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,850
preparation at all I mean Bob that's

335
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,449
stupid

336
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,220
no one even explained to Kirk how far he

337
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,630
could go into this glorified funeral

338
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,889
parlor I guess no one had any

339
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,510
conversations of any kind before going

340
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,399
through with us I asked for Pfau tarp on

341
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,649
the reef Yujin what you seek has not

342
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,410
been done since ages past and then only

343
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,290
a legend your request is not logical oh

344
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,060
but these three women holding up their

345
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,500
right hands and wearing bunny ears is

346
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,120
logical just do the foul tour pan lady

347
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,589
can someone tell me why I'm aroused

348
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,389
right now is it all the cross dissolves

349
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,920
and intimate close-ups that are fully me

350
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,420
into thinking I'm watching softcore porn

351
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,829
literally over five minutes of

352
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,660
ceremonial vulcan bull we already know

353
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,449
the outcome up so bones is okay Spock is

354
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,100
walking upright does no one on Vulcan

355
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,360
stop to think about the fact that they

356
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
just pulled off the foul tour pan which

357
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,930
was just a legend before tonight you

358
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,279
assholes believe in ceremonies and a

359
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,389
bunch of bull so it's hard to believe

360
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:37,040
you and step back and go god damn that

361
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,899
was remarkable why would you do this

362
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,160
because the needs of the one outweighed

363
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,269
the needs of the many

364
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,220
Kirk flipped the script on you Spock

365
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,319
diam wait a minute that still doesn't

366
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,670
make any sense I can't help but think

367
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,630
this whole thing could have been avoided

368
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,490
if they just brought Spock back to his

369
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,319
home planet in the first place sure he

370
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:55,339
would have gotten that sweet sweet

371
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,110
Regenesis to magically come back to life

372
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,670
but we could have avoided this movie at

373
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,220
least bring on the whales

374
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:17,280
we need her to speak where can you get

375
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,870
you next time gadget next time this is

376
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,950
the Nebuchadnezzar on approach

377
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,699
requesting access to gate 3

378
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,139
Nebuchadnezzar this is ion control

379
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:39,699
maintain present velocity and standby

380
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,830
you

381
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,080
no Jim the enterprise would never stand

382
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:56,730
the pounding mom phrasing no one would

383
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,800
have believed in the early years of the

384
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,050
21st century that our world was being

385
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,330
watched by intelligences greater than

386
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,740
alcohol as yeah yeah but this time I've

387
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,970
got the money

388
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,610
AJ yeah called I in decoding what's on

389
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,110
our side elevator agents on their way up

390
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,100
the tree to exit

he should check up please have certainly

392
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,790
changed around here

393
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,810
I remember when this is all farmland as

394
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,130
far as the eye could see

395
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:42,000
oh man Peabody on all of this
