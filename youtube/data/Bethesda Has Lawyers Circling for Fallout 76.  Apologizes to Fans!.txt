YouTube boogie2988 coming at your levels

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,790
again through the power of the Internet

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,200
and this is my weekly gaming news

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,340
wrap-up even though there's so much

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,750
gaming news I might actually squeeze out

20
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,660
to this week but I really want to just

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,040
jump right into the game so let's start

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,559
talking about fallout 76 so a lot of

23
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,820
stuff to cover since the last time we

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,410
talked about fallout 76 probably the

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,450
first of which is they have deeply

26
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,760
discounted this game already probably

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,110
one of the earliest deep discounts

28
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,550
you've ever seen of a game of course the

29
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,570
game released like a week and a half

30
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,879
before Black Friday we saw a lot of

31
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,530
Black Friday cells dropping it down to

32
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,250
$40 some as low as $35 one as low as $30

33
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,780
depending where you're getting at on

34
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,630
Xbox Playstation or PC so anybody who

35
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,070
bought it pre-ordered it or bought it

36
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,590
day one ended out losing like 25 30

37
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,900
bucks right off the bat and that's left

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,729
a lot of people frustrated one of my

39
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,290
favorite posts I saw and read about this

40
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,490
is saying that that should rename the

41
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,570
game to fallout 76 percent off week one

42
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,009
now this amongst other things has made a

43
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,600
lot of people want to get a refund for

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,009
the game a lot of people thinking if I

45
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,900
refund my full purchase price and I'll

46
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,490
be able to repurchase the game either

47
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,119
today or later for half off 75% off

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,770
later in the future I'll be able to buy

49
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,119
the game when it's patched when it's

50
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,549
fixed and at first Bethesda seemed to be

51
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,590
playing along with that there is a post

52
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,320
on reset era discussing refunds somebody

53
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,060
saying they asked for a refund for the

54
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,369
PC version via the Bethesda launcher and

55
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,290
was able to get it but very quickly

56
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,570
there's a reports saying that Bethesda

57
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,820
is no longer allowing refunds basically

58
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,350
running launcher the the terms and

59
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,420
conditions for Fallout 76 basically

60
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,159
state that you cannot apply for a refund

61
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,799
once the software has been used and a

62
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,390
lot of players were getting messages

63
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,909
back when they filed refund requests

64
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,439
saying that either they downloaded the

65
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,700
game so they couldn't get a refund they

66
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,899
used the game so they couldn't get a

67
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,660
refund basically you're just not getting

68
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,270
a refund

69
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,830
now the refusal to issue refunds

70
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,020
actually has lawyers circling like

71
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,460
vultures if you check the fallout

72
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,890
subreddits if you check the Fallen 76

73
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,750
over there is a post there right now

74
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,180
where lawyers are looking for clients to

75
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,790
join them in a class-action lawsuit to

76
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,560
sue Bethesda for releasing an

77
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,960
intentionally early release of a buggy

78
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,030
game and then not issuing refunds for

79
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,310
people who can't play the game one of

80
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,480
the reasons people are pointing to this

81
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,130
looking like an intentional gotcha

82
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,050
situation is because this is one of the

83
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,330
first bethesda games to not show up on

84
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,280
the steam storefront and of course steam

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,170
does allow refunds if you played the

86
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,490
game for less than two hours and owned

87
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,470
the game for less than 10 days you could

88
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,780
have refunded on steam but Bethesda is

89
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,880
not let you refunding it if you bought

90
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,020
it through the Bethesda launcher which

91
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,330
is the only way to buy this game and of

92
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,980
course that's the PC version I'm talking

93
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,600
about there of course if you bought it

94
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,740
through Xbox if you bought it through

95
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
PlayStation there's a chance you can get

96
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,800
a refund there but those stores are

97
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,660
pretty notorious about not giving you

98
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,310
refunds as well when it comes to bugs

99
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,080
it's not just the normal bugs that you

100
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,610
would expect for an online game like

101
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,770
connectivity issues and server issues

102
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,110
and that kind of thing that's definitely

103
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,600
there but there are much bigger issues

104
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,760
at play here one bug that was so extreme

105
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,610
it went viral it made a character go

106
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,920
completely unkillable they had permanent

107
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,840
godmode stuck at zero hit points and

108
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,300
unable to die rendering the game

109
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,430
relatively unfun and relatively

110
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,560
unplayable for that character the the

111
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,760
person who complained about this

112
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,740
basically begged the developers to kill

113
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,570
them and they were unable to do it

114
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,640
basically ignoring the ticket altogether

115
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,680
now fortunately the player who figured

116
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,270
that out that say was probably

117
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,250
reproducible but did not give away the

118
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,600
secret from doing if it looks like other

119
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,950
people have figured out how to do that

120
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,200
so there's immortal characters running

121
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,730
around the game and that's just one

122
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,500
example of some of the bugs this game is

123
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,270
currently facing a Reddit user by the

124
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,920
name of Sir salty actually took it on

125
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,540
himself on the fallout seventy six

126
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,580
subreddit to basically collect all of

127
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,920
the different bugs and this is not even

128
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,620
a complete list but it's already quite

129
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,980
quite lengthy and obviously people have

130
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,209
been waiting for like an official

131
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,590
response from Bethesda to talk about

132
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,330
refunds to talk about bugs to talk about

133
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,730
issues maybe to even apologize for the

134
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,530
game and it looks like just a few

135
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,750
minutes ago we actually got that today

136
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,000
on the fallout 76 subreddit we saw the

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,020
official Bethesda games studio

138
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,849
account post we know you're frustrated

139
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,740
and angry at the state of things right

140
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,180
now whether it's the issues you're

141
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,250
running into into the game or the lack

142
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,590
of communication about fixes updates or

143
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,710
news we're sorry and understand this is

144
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,479
not the right approach and will work to

145
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:42,979
make a better bridge between you and the

146
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,530
dev teams at bgs now along with that

147
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,289
apology we did see them outlining some

148
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,060
examples of what they will do to try to

149
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,370
fix the game moving forward and I'll

150
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,780
show you those real quick on December

151
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,729
4th they're increasing the stash limit

152
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,530
they're making loot a little better for

153
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,270
bosses they're changing the cryolator

154
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,610
effects responding when encumbered is

155
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,259
now going to be fixed and for the people

156
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,729
who get stuck in power ombré they're

157
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,409
working on that as well and then on

158
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,120
December 11th there's a few more changes

159
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,400
coming including the very heavily

160
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,590
requested push-to-talk function you can

161
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,080
respec your special at level 50 some

162
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,819
changes the way your camp is placed when

163
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,490
you log in and some other minor fixes in

164
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,259
look these minor changes are great for

165
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,580
people who are still playing this game I

166
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,870
have friends who bought this game and

167
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,360
are enjoying it bugs and all and there's

168
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,500
no problem with that

169
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,449
here's the thing though a lot of people

170
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,039
don't enjoy the game a lot of people

171
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
bought the game under false pretenses a

172
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,370
lot of people bought the game and felt

173
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,900
they were taking advantage of a lot of

174
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,280
people bought the game and are unable to

175
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,009
play their version of the game and want

176
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:40,729
to get their money back

177
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,919
so Bethesda we wanted you to talk about

178
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,630
refunds and we don't want to have to go

179
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,580
through a class-action lawsuit to do it

180
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,229
we don't want to make just some lawyer

181
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,120
rich we just want our money back so we

182
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,039
can buy the game later when you have it

183
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,380
fixed please let us do that Bethesda

184
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,389
this isn't a matter of fixing minor

185
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,580
bucks this is not a matter of better

186
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,830
communication this is a matter of

187
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,380
offering refunds to the people who want

188
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,210
them because they felt they were cheated

189
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,250
and when they purchased your game just

190
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,229
do the right thing just do the right

191
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,960
thing just do it but as usual I would

192
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,250
like to hear what you guys have to say

193
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,770

194
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,330
a refund are you trying to get it really

195
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,349

196
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,270
just enjoying the game waiting for these

197
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,409
patches and hoping for the better

198
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:23,509
communication I really I'm just one

199
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,099
person's opinion I'm curious as to what

200
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,750
you think and like I said I have friends

201
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,889
who are playing this game and are

202
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,870
staunchly defending this game and if

203
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,520
you're one of those people I hope that

204
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,380
you enjoyed this game do not let my self

205
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,870
or this video or any other person's

206
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,089
critiques of that game make you feel

207
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,710
differently about the game you enjoy the

208
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,520
game that you want to

209
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,410
if you're enjoying it let let us know in

210
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,360
the comments section down below

211
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
personally as buggy's of the game is I

212
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,389
feel like there's a nice foundation

213
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,949
there I feel like with another year

214
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,449
later this game would have been much

215
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,889
much better iron out a lot of those bugs

216
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,080
I had a little bit more content make the

217
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,729
game a little bit more fun I think I

218
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,500
would have really really enjoyed the

219
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,300
game that's there it's kind of a another

220
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,340
CSC situation there's a really good

221
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,990
groundwork there's just not enough

222
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,060
content and enough stuff for me to do to

223
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,889
feel like I really want to do it and I

224
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,389

240
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,620

241
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,940
holiday season you are going to be

242
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,800
tempted to get onto Wi-Fi in all of

243
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,909
these different places to keep from

244
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,219
using data and these guys are ready for

245
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,169

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520

248
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,870

253
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,020
traveling trust me it is a nightmare but

254
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,810
by installing Nord VPN on your phone you

255
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,400
are guaranteed to keep your data safe

256
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,169
when you connect to Wi-Fi or any other

257
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:13,909
time and here's the best thing about it

258
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,740
the reason I choose Nord VPN is because

259
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,270
there's a bunch of other perks with it

260
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,889
as well not only does it keep your data

261
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,990
safe but you can use it with stuff like

262
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,479
Netflix you can use it while turning if

263
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,130
you install it on an Android device you

264
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,490
can block advertisements and Nord never

265
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,919
logs what you do when you connect to

266
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,510
their servers they are not logging you

267
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,610
at all so before you start traveling or

268
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,899
