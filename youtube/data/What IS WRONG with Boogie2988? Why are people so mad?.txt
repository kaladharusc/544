1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,159
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,510
YouTube but look it 298 coming at you

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,100
liable to get through the power of the

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,960
internet and this is my rambling series

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,250
this is my vlogging series in which I

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,929
just talk about life the universe things

7
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:10,740
around us that are particularly

8
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,940
interesting to me things that are

9
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,349
personally affecting me they're going on

10
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,490
to the world I'll talk about the YouTube

11
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,480
channel I'll talk about my health my

12
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,430
wealth my life my mental health I'll

13
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,680
just talk about whatever let us talk

14
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,410
about whatever I don't really know

15
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,699
exactly what all I'm gonna cover in this

16
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,949
issue so I'm definitely going to issue

17
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,400
like it's a comic Stanley is on my mind

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm just gonna talk about whatever comes

19
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,980
to mind this week I think I don't know

20
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,690
whatever to title this week's episode

21
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,250
I'm gonna be like what is wrong with

22
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,290
boogie or what's going on with boogie

23
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,790
because I've been hearing that question

24
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,160
a lot on social media you're right it's

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,719
- Twitter's your Facebook's you're

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,280
everywhere else

27
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,539
and there's a lot of people have been

28
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,309
confused about the type of content that

29
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,660
I've been uploading so I think that's

30
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,300
probably the best place to start

31
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,430
so if you did not see it yet I will link

32
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,899
to it here I might link to it up here as

33
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,879
well or just check the channel you'll

34
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,890
see I uploaded a gaming podcast which

35
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,930
currently is setting at about 39,000

36
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,140
40,000 views now I've seen some people

37
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,729
say well this is a failure of a podcast

38
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,600
you only got 40,000 views I okay I'm not

39
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,689
trying to be the h3 podcast here I don't

40
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,670
think I'll ever be Joe Rogan what I want

41
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,580
to do is I want to be a job creator no I

42
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,619
know that sounds silly so let me explain

43
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,180
to you how I'm getting that the two

44
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,710
people I made that podcast with or two

45
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,060
of my closest friends for the last

46
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,920
decade they're people who helped me limp

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,180
through my divorce they're people who

48
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,869
helped me just survive the world I set

49
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:31,890
them down and I'm like you guys are

50
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,299
doing twitch for a living now right yes

51
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,909
you guys want a little hand yes let's do

52
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,409
a podcast together we'll do like a

53
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,030
weekly guest we'll talk about video

54
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,950
games we'll test it we'll see what the

55
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,240
audience takes we'll see if there's any

56
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,070
ad revenue that can be brought in let's

57
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,479
see if there's sponsors who want to bite

58
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,280
and if they do we can give you guys a

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,030
leg up now I still enjoy creating the

60
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,500
content that's also why I'm doing it

61
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,180
because I have fun to just sit and talk

62
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,829
with my friends about video games and

63
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,780
what's going on in the world and and and

64
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,280
also talk about current events and talk

65
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,630
about YouTube and talk about life and

66
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,369
just do that and I think it's also gonna

67
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,719
be really a lot of fun to invite some

68
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,850
guests and do that kind of thing but it

69
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,170
was an opportunity to help out a couple

70
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,879
of friends and that's my primary motive

71
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,790
motivation so 40,000 views for a project

72
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,770
like that seems very

73
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,630
we still have put it on iTunes we stuff

74
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,330
and put them on Spotify and so the plans

75
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,100
with that is I think the main episode is

76
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,480
going to go up here on the channel

77
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,330
every time we film it and then I think

78
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,770
already create a podcast channel once we

79
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,000
have a name for the podcast I think

80
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,170
we're going to create a podcast channel

81
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,670
and then we're gonna put highlights

82
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,160
there so section it out in the little

83
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,810
you know maybe one upload a day or one

84
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,240
upload every other day a little 10

85
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,530
minute segment so this is what they

86
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,550
talked about here this is what they

87
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,840
talked about there now for those of you

88
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,050
who did watch that episode YouTube Auto

89
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,290
assigned adds to it and put ads in every

90
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,110
five minutes I'm sorry for that that was

91
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,350
never my intention I since removed those

92
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,850
ads and I think if you watch it now I

93
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,490
told it to suggest ads differently and

94
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,650
then I don't know how populated this so

95
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,540
I said to one every 15 20 minutes or

96
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,980
something like that which i think is

97
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,720
pretty regular for the podcast I listen

98
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,820
to though I do have YouTube read on one

99
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,170
of my main accounts I do own one of my

100
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,640
list of accounts watch accounts I don't

101
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,990
have YouTube read so I do see the ads

102
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,260
anyway long story short um it was a lot

103
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,450
of fun so then that leads me to the

104
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,890
interview that I did with kid behind the

105
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,500
camera Michael which I knew going into

106
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,420
it was going to be very very polarizing

107
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,250
lots of people love Michael lots of

108
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,920
people hate Michael that is a direction

109
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,390
I want choose I'm willingly choosing Lea

110
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,730
going into it if that's upsetting for

111
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,100
you as a fan as a friend as someone

112
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,540
who's followed me for a while I will

113
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,830
tell you that the video you're watching

114
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,630
right now I'll always love plug once a

115
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,340
week the gaming podcast I'll hopefully

116
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,620
old upload once a week the gaming news I

117
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,910
will still upload once a week and a

118
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,800
phrase a sketch I will still upload once

119
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,930
a week you can exclusively watch those

120
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,870
videos but occasionally I want to

121
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,080
interview other youtubers and sometimes

122
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,690
they will be polarizing because and this

123
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,010
is where I'm going to take the black

124
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,040
pill approach and I think that's the

125
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,430
right phrase

126
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,650
I don't quote me on that because I don't

127
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,230
know exactly what the black pill means I

128
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,910
thought it meant slike know you know I

129
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,680
know what's really going on when it

130
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,180
comes to technology if that's what that

131
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,470
means then that's what I mean

132
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,010
um the Internet is very polarizing and

133
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,530
being somebody who's had vicious rumors

134
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,630
and and things taken out of context and

135
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,370
and then also the stupid things an

136
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,940
action

137
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,770
getting thrown up in front of people oh

138
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,840
I can understand how misinformation

139
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,820
spreads and how people hear one thing

140
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,170
about you but they never really give you

141
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,670
a fair chance and stuff like that

142
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,100
I wanted Michael to have an opportunity

143
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,350
to save whatever it is he wanted to say

144
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,130
for you all I did was prep questions

145
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,690
all I did was asking those questions I

146
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,820
let my friend Jeff edit it so I wasn't

147
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,320
the one had it having editing control

148
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,550
hopefully he'll add up my future

149
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,810
interviews or someone will let her buy

150
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,000
into future interviews and we will give

151
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,250
people who are polarized on the Internet

152
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,720
probably never the Logan Paul's at the

153
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,060
Internet but hopefully people out there

154
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,280
maybe somebody on the far left somebody

155
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,710
on the far right maybe sometime some

156
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,290
sort of centrist somebody who leans just

157
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,420
a little left like I do maybe we'll pick

158
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,880
people who sometimes are politically

159
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,050
hated sometimes who have gotten

160
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,880
themselves into controversies sometimes

161
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,430
people who have made mistakes and allow

162
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,710
them to speak for themselves now some

163
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,910
people watch that kid behind the camera

164
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,140
video and say hey buggy I think you did

165
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,310
a great job some people look at that kid

166
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,390
behind the camera video and they say

167
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,430
they confirmed every single thing I

168
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,210
thought about him I knew I always knew I

169
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,290
don't care what you got out of that I

170
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,669
don't I don't care

171
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,530
my goal was never to make Michael look

172
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,880
good my goal is never to make Michael

173
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,860
look bad my goal was to create an

174
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,250
opportunity for you to form an opinion

175
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,560
that's it and hopefully an informed

176
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,810
opinion that's it that's all I ever

177
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,450
cared about I think I did that fairly

178
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,040
well for those of you who are upset

179
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,419
about that for those of you don't like

180
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,860
that direction of some of you don't like

181
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,630
that maybe it'll get its own second

182
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,310
channel one day maybe we'll figure

183
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,140
something out but I promise you this

184
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,730
will still do rambling videos once a

185
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,630
week and we'll keep them fun and

186
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,550
light-hearted we will continue to do the

187
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,840
Francis sketches and they will be fun

188
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,430
and light-hearted we will continue to do

189
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,750
the gaming podcast and it'll focus

190
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,150
mostly on games but with some stuff

191
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,669
thrown in life events and and just stuff

192
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,790
and just friends being friends and and

193
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,770
and maybe you know current events or

194
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,840
movie reviews or stuff like that and

195
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
then we will continue to do the gaming

196
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,980
news podcast or the gaming news wrap-up

197
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,540
every week so there's still plenty of

198
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,160
content that you can watch if you don't

199
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,660
like that one thing whoo okay so let's

200
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,970
talk a little bit about Twitter which if

201
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,539
you guys don't know this I don't

202
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,830
understand Twitter anymore I'm not very

203
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,510
good at Twitter I've got a Twitter

204
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,750
account like 700,000

205
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,040
people following me most of which are

206
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,210
dead accounts just like the YouTube

207
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,010
channel here's 4.5 million people

208
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,870
following me but only a few hundred

209
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,670
thousand active users that said um on

210
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,110
Twitter a good number of people who

211
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,390
don't follow me love to check everything

212
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,490
I say and and find something wrong with

213
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,500
what I have to say a lot of times I am

214
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,680
very idealistic I am very simple I am

215
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,570
very stupid and something else I think

216
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,400
is important to point out I'm also very

217
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
old a lot of things that I was learning

218
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,950
in high school please keep in mind I

219
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,120
learned it 30 to 35 years ago we changed

220
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,580
a lot of things in 30 to 35 years I

221
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,140
think that's an important thing to

222
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,520
remember so a lot of things that I was

223
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,300
taught in high school

224
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,100
Christopher Columbus is certainly a

225
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,900
perfect example I stalk Christopher

226
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,340
Columbus was some sort of hero obviously

227
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,130
in retrospect he is not a perfect

228
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,690
example and I will occasionally get in

229
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,680
trouble because I'll say something like

230
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,060
hey you know who's a real hero is that

231
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,610
Christopher Columbus guy and I'll get in

232
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,500
a lot of trouble for it that's recently

233
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,120
what has happened here I will tell you

234
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,450
this social media is probably the most

235
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,060
negative thing in my life and I

236
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,979
understand why people like h3 or

237
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,050
PewDiePie or other people choose to

238
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,440
never read their verified tab they

239
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,470
choose to never read their the responses

240
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,150
and I'm trying to learn to choose to do

241
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,890
that I understand why somebody like

242
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,350
totalbiscuit especially would hire

243
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,300
someone to manage their Twitter for them

244
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,440
not because John was particularly

245
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,770
polarizing he was sometimes but mostly

246
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,650
because he and I have a very very common

247
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,540
thing and that we we take that criticism

248
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,000
very deeply to heart I'll often point

249
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,190
that out to people I say you know the

250
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,560
reason the monsters the actual monsters

251
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,380
out there who don't actually care you

252
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,940
the reason people don't attack those

253
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,500
people the people who don't actually

254
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,120
care that people are actually part of

255
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,530
the problem I mean art that are the

256
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,060
major problem I can be part of the

257
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,440
problem but the people who are the major

258
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
problem right your political pundits

259
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,180
your politicians the reason because they

260
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,710
don't care they don't care they're

261
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,969
sociopaths they're Psychopaths they

262
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,040
don't care people like me we do care

263
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,940
John cared deeply um Stan Lee cared

264
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,280
deeply these these are people who who

265
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,080
would listen to this feedback and take

266
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,220
it to heart and I

267
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,259
that's one of the reasons eventually my

268
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,879
heart bleeds when why when that blood

269
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,800
hits the water people go in on the

270
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,569
offensive they say Oh made a hole in the

271
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,029
armor we made a crack in the hole we're

272
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,350
ready - we're ready to go we're ready to

273
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,269
go here's something I truly believe and

274
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,519
I talked to somebody today who believes

275
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,420
the same thing and I think it's

276
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,759
interesting long time ago I remember

277
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,379
this don't quote me on it you can do

278
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,699
your own research please do but I think

279
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:18,970
I remember a facebook document that came

280
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,829
out that said that people on Facebook

281
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,639
spent more money and engaged with

282
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,579
advertisers more frequently if they were

283
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,290
reading depressing news and angering

284
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,180
news upsetting news largely I think that

285
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,160
statistic is accurate I do think that

286
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,449
people are angry people are frustrated

287
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:38,889
people irritated I think they are more

288
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,139
likely to engage with non angering

289
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,370
content or stuff that will make them

290
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,160
happy like stuff they want to purchase I

291
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,230
think that is very very true I think

292
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,930
whether people have willingly or

293
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,550
unwillingly embraced that is true I

294
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,230
think Facebook willingly embraced it for

295
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,839
a while I think maybe Twitter willingly

296
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,699
embraces it too I think if you look at

297
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,050
the trending stuff on Twitter for

298
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,300
example or if you look at the Twitter

299
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,040
moments for example I know live you

300
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
don't have a Twitter which is a good

301
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,550
decision I genuinely believe that that

302
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,309
said it's always polarizing it's always

303
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,350
upsetting it's it's very rarely good

304
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,720
news it's very rarely exciting stuff and

305
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,910
that could just be the way we users use

306
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,300
it

307
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,730
lord knows reddit is almost entirely

308
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,470
freeform you can say or do whatever you

309
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,209
want to say or do or read and you choose

310
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,339
what's on top of it gets uploaded reddit

311
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,050
there's also a very negative place so it

312
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,550
is stands to reason that people are just

313
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,350
very negative that we are all very

314
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,410
negative Louie we like drama we like

315
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,389
being frustrated we like being irritated

316
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:36,189
we like being on the offensive we like

317
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:39,009
being offended we like being mad lord

318
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,769
knows I buy into that too diablo

319
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,790
immortal anybody mm-hmm so I think it's

320
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,370
a human trait but I do think these

321
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,649
social media platforms are designed to

322
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,029
embrace them and I think that's one of

323
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,550
the things we've seen here at the fall

324
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,160
of YouTube I think during the rise of

325
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,680
YouTube we saw quite a few people and I

326
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
say fall of YouTube I'm certainly I'm

327
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,189
certainly biased there because it's my

328
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:04,240
channel that's failing more than

329
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,329
anything but um I think when we saw the

330
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:08,500
rise of you

331
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,480
we saw right towards the end of the rise

332
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,190
of YouTube we saw the drama channels and

333
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,779
we saw that the commentary and the

334
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,940
negative channels start to take over and

335
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,580
now the platform seems to be not doing

336
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,930
as well and maybe that's because

337
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,279
algorithmically they're trying to get

338
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,290
rid of channels like those but they

339
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,020
still perform better than most um or

340
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,130
maybe it's just because people are tired

341
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,690
of my crap and I have a biased point of

342
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,830
view but I do know a lot of other

343
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,240
creators who are saying exactly the same

344
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,089
thing so it is it's interesting if you

345
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,950
use social media is it a mostly positive

346
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,510
experience for you or is it a mostly

347
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,760
negative experience for you in which

348
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,770
social media do you use how do you use

349
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,060
YouTube do you look for polarizing

350
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,890
content already look for content that's

351
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,850
just light and fluffy

352
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,440
I still watch a lot of good mythical

353
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,959
morning but I still watch Philip

354
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,870
DeFranco every single day and he's

355
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,149
pretty polarizing so what does that say

356
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,500
about me I you know I still watch

357
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,810
idubbbz when he uploads I still watch h3

358
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,010
what do you upload it's not the podcast

359
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,360
as much but you know when he actually

360
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,940
Apple is the comedy video stuff I don't

361
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,820
know it's interesting um here's what I

362
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,370
will say I did post a forum about the

363
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,050
the podcast for people listened to it a

364
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,880
few hundred people filled it out thank

365
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,050
you for doing that it's gonna provide us

366
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,130
a lot of information if you didn't

367
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,450
listen to that podcast I'm gonna link

368
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,220
the forum again down here below there's

369
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,690
also a sponsored link of this video I'm

370
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,920
not doing a shout out for them anything

371
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,910
but you want to click on that and a

372
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,149
you're more than welcome to um and let's

373
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:25,990
see is there anything else really

374
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,130
important to talk about this week I

375
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,720
think I think that pretty much wraps it

376
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
up here's what I will say what is going

377
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,209
on with boogie why is buggy doing what

378
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,250
he's doing it's just that time of year

379
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,290
the holidays have always been really

380
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,000
hard for me especially since I lost my

381
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,520
original family losing my newest family

382
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,680
especially hard but fortunately I still

383
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,570
have a pretty extended group of family

384
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,579
and friends between that and the stress

385
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,170
of work and the stress of life and

386
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,730
coming up on the one-year anniversary of

387
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,560
the divorce and the beginning of all of

388
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,149
that it's been a really stressful time

389
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,640
you know the anniversary of the death of

390
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,589
my mom the anniversary of her birthday

391
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,560
you know it's just a tough time you hear

392
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
November December especially difficult

393
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,160
and the fact that that's crunch time for

394
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,720
youtubers can make it even more

395
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,709
difficult so expect me to screw up a

396
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,910
bunch more times between now and

397
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,100
December expect me to miss upload days

398
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,820
expect me to put be super dramatic on

399
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,440
twitch streams at some point expect me

400
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,570
to just

401
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,300
continue to be me as I tend to be and

402
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,730
