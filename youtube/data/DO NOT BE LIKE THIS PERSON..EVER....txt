124
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,390
come out over here to me hey hey look at

125
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,800
that dude he looks like maybe I should

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,380
just be kind of hiding kind of seems

127
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,950
like my best bet oh that dude okay yeah

128
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,400
go on you're jolly freakin way out it

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,030
freakin out of here

130
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,950
I'm taking my jolly butt to the to the

131
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,720
to the diamonds

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,310
I see diamonds I really don't know how

133
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:50,210
far they they're at but yeah this is

134
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,620
probably my best bet I don't I really

135
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,440
don't know what I'm doing but this seems

136
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,930
like this this is a smart thing to do

137
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,790
oh you're some diamonds dude

138
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,440

139
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,900

140
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,510

okay

181
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,650
yep and he's dead that that probably

182
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:23,720
wasn't the very probably wasn't very

183
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,060
very best best idea so we have gray we

184
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,110
have gray and there's me versus versus a

185
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,790
dude who's who's gray but probably not

186
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,400
the smartest idea of for him to do but

187
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,730
that's okay that's okay okay so one

188
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,170
thing good about that I don't have to

189
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,740
stress out like getting the Diamonds so

190
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,710
I don't know who's gray base but seems

191
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,470
like he's like all the way crossed

192
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,550
somewhere somewhere you know else far

193
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,060
away I had the high ground but you know

194
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,890
I somehow won that like never happens

195
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,550
that's like the final physics okay so

196
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,870
little upgrades oh do we want the dragon

197
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,870
buff we have two more diamonds left

198
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,710
gained mining fatigue blue Christie

199
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,370
respond rate of iron gold by 50% 50% all

200
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,550
players on your team permanently get

201
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,980
haste one didn't I

202
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,670
which one did I get did did I end up

203
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,680
like getting the the shark this one I

204
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,100
don't remember I don't remember at all

205
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,790
actually

206
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:50,570
I want to get the sharpness one there we

207
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,690
go and that I think we're good I think

208
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,650
we're good

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,630
I don't know though but I think we are

210
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,870
so there's an emerald upgrade I feel

211
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,610
like that's okay we got sharpness that's

212
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,620
pretty cool that is pretty cool did we

213
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,210
get the armor one white I thought we got

214
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,850
the armor one which ones did we get it's

215
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:25,130
