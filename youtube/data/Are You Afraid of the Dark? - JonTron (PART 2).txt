00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
him so these three kids

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,429
Josh Cathy and a Ouija step up and dare

25
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:27,690
each other to enter this haunted

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,940
funhouse but right before Josh goes in

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,979

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
typecast as the creepy guy who tells

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
riddles to kids because if so I think

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,259
this guy might be at the forefront of

35
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,829
his industry coming in mr. brain I think

36
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,149
maybe you could run that by me one more

37
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,340
time coming in mr. brain

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,920

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,990
time hey kid listen I don't blame me I'd

40
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,310

41
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,560

Canadians home just have a hockey room

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,090
in this scene we find out that a clown

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,980
named Zeebo was killed in a tragic

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,830
tragic funhouse fire for a whole night

47
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,980
there that house got a lot less fun

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,590
Zeebo smokes cigars the police figured

49
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,840
he threw one away in the spook house

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,150
because the whole place caught fire with

51
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,090
him inside that kid is uh clearly

52
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,430
reading off the script tragically the

53
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,180
clown perished in the inferno II you

54
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,410
what a weird old guy he died yuck I bet

55
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,209
he likes a trap small children inside

56
00:02:49,209 --> 00:03:01,209
and tickle you know I'm glad I saw that

57
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:01,930
one through to the end

58
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,880
that evil redheaded boy got what he

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,650
deserved the real monster was the

60
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,600
monster inside their friend this clown

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,250
is said to have died in the funhouse and

62
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,110
he's basically a big old curse on the

63
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,870
place so we G double dares Josh to go in

64
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,510
the funhouse alone but Josh 1ups him by

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,980
saying that not only will he go it alone

66
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,190
but he'll steal Z Bo's nose so Josh

67
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,489
grabs Ouija and he wormholes him into

68
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,560
the park and off they go to most likely

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,670
die at the foot of their own hubris

70
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,950
look at me I'm Zeebo

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,740
of them up there well you haven't got

168
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,120
the hang of this by now also I don't

169
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
think your slam-dunk method is doing me

170
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,290
any favors here do me a favor go down in

171
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,670
the basement and see if you had a ladder

172
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,020
it's the basement

173
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,370
what's the matter and search no I'm not

174
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,470
afraid of the dark well that's a shame

175
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,660
cuz you're a fucking liar Andy and also

176
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,130
that's the name of the show so I'm

177
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,630
pretty sure it's fair to say you're in

178
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:16,730
for some shit hmm oh yeah any day now

179
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,160
he's never gonna end there he is

180
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,110
so Andy goes into the basement to get

181
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,880
the ladder and starts playing with an

182
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,370
old radio for some reason hey

183
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,320
somebody hit the wall switch up there I

184
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,580
need some power oh I haven't felt love

185
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,710
like that since the Third Reich

186
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,250
I heard that

187
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,130
yeah ghosts I heard you so you better

188
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,650
knock that off back there yeah just get

189
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:57,400
right into that that's my jam as you can

190
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,290
see Andy gets scared shitless by these

191
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,270
two red eyes and runs upstairs to tell

192
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,240
his mom it was in there and talked to me

193
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,010
and said come in and I'll suck sure

194
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,780
there's something like kid you're gonna

195
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,010
have to be a little more specific when

196
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,600
you make these kinds of accusations I

197
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,640
swear mom there was something in here

198
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,390
a leaky old plumbing yeah probably one

199
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,670
of those things this house is falling

200
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,520
apart unrelated so the mom brushes off

201
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,110
the ghost encounter by saying it was

202
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,150
probably just this old radio which makes

203
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,310
sense surprisingly but Andy still isn't

204
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,380
convinced that's good something to eat

205
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,540
before Christina gets it off yes because

206
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,490
your sister is a ravenous badger girl

207
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,840
that will eat all our food until her

208
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,810
stomach explodes can we uh back up there

209
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,470
for a second I think I found out who the

210
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,590
demon is Andy decides to ask his mom for

211
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,240
a little more info about who his uncle

212
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,670
was he never left the house but somehow

213
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,910
got filthy rich how did he die he was

214
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,640
old and just stopped living yes I think

215
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,070
that's the case for most people find him

216
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,210
in the basement at the bottom let's

217
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,700
change the subject

218
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,020
Chris go down and put the clothes in the

219
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,850
laundry for me okay you know where the

220
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,000
dead body I was just talking about was

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,650
what game is she even playing she looks

222
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,740
like a chip trying to use a telephone

223
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,320
I can't for your scared women let's go

224
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,790
out fully beat me up got a paper round

225
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,350
alright alright come on this isn't scary

226
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,820
at all I mean how many times is he gonna

227
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,020
dick around in the basement for

228
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:46,100
something actually happen I think I'm

229
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,720
gonna have to watch the rest of this one

230
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,470
with the lights on they explained that

231
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,850
Andy forgets these incidents that are

232
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,530
seemingly caused by music which is the

233
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,940
reason he keeps going down and screwing

234
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,040
up except for the first time in which he

235
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,930
did remember basically the writers

236
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,400
didn't give a shit but it's okay

237
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,770
neither to the audience so Andy's mom

238
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,300
leaves him a note to go down to the

239
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,310
basement and do more you guessed it

240
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,790
laundry in this show laundry moves the

241
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,980
plot forward that is not a good sign

242
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,330
also we're just not gonna talk about

243
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,040
this human hand in the jar back here

244
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,930
just it's not gonna talk about it I keep

245
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,880
it you remember in the matrix when Neil

246
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,500
discovered the matrix cuz he had to go

247
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
downstairs and do a towel wash or when

248
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,980
Maximus was like did you put my work

249
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,410
clothes in the dryer or even when Clark

250
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,080
Gable was like frankly dear I separate

251
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,030
the whites from the colors except that

252
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,500
one wasn't about laundry that was real

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,450
that was about racism by the way what is

254
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,890
it with parents and always leaving their

255
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,660
kids notes in these shows I guess it's

256
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,160
just an enabler for haunted happenings

257
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,990
you're listening to stock music radio

258
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,390
only the safest music that keeps

259
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:58,300
production costs low and scares high

260
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:05,070
oh yeah weird clown music turn it up oh

261
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:14,390

music it's music not laundry like I

264
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,060
thought excitedly Andy hops on his bike

265
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,740
to go tell his mom like any kid would

266
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,029
want to do nice day for a ride isn't it

267
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,410
ok that's one for the record books

268
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,470
we got to show that again not much of a

269
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,880
punch but it would give a door a mean

270
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,490
knock mom's not gonna help you now kids

272
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,860
after suffering this abuse for too long

273
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,660
Andy comes up with a plan for revenge

274
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,880
and also his house number is 420 which

275
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,500
is probably a metric pain in the ass on

276
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,329
the 20th day of April well you're done

277
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,490
come over and clean my house you make a

278
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,350
good maid you're dead

279

Oh sick burns all around today through a

280
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,700
master class of trickery Andy traps the

281
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,110
neighborhood bully in his basement to

282
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,490
teach him a lesson once and for all

283
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,649
after realizing that music summons the

284
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,510
dark spirit he blasts some awesome metal

285
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,920
