00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,940
India

00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,440
*Ting*
(THiS SuRe Is GoNna be GreAt!)

3

7
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,020
A country with men that finally understands (YGS) romance.
(JK. ok i will stop!)

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,810
When I said I can get you the moon,

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,212

We have a lot of stuff to learn from India still.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,900
So today we're going to dwel dwell deeper into its culture,

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,580
into its TV shows,

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,740
Don't laugh.

22
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,520
Let's begin the challenge.

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,940
Most dramatic scene ever.

24
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,240
Okay, let's watch

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,400

(Pewds laughing at le epic scene)

34
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,080

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,900
this can't be real
(It is, the show is called Kasamh Se)

36
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,160
Jesus Christ this puts Brad1's and Brad2's editing to shame. What is this?

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,000
Jesus Christ that was amazing.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,120
Indian soap opera scenes.

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,940
Okay.

40
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,580
The boss of NV group of companies is Miss (last name???)

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,080
(Slap right in the face)(twice)

00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080

00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,460
(Le dramatic scene commences)
(Pewds.exe is still busy laughing and losing)

46
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,400
Do you know who those people are?
Do you understand who you asked for help?

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,120
(Thunder sounds)

48
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,100
What have you done!

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,040
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,560
I need to watch some Indian dramas clearly.

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,449
It reminds me of the sound from that all the viners use in every single clip.

52
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,720
bdhuuum
(Me trying to write what Pewds says while trying to explain the sound in question)

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,800
The sound in question.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:26,460
Dramatic indian drama character introduction. Okay, let's watch

55
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:35,120
*disintegration meme*

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:45,600
Oh My god, why are my intros not that good? This is some next-level editing

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,040
JESUS CHRIST!

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,040
*I don't feel so good*

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,830
It's like they just locked an editor in the room and be like here's

60
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:05,329
$2 and 500 grams of cocaine now edit this bit the coolest way possible

61
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:25,730
Dramatic Indian paper signing

62
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,740
This reminds me of a it's like a real-life anime

63
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,500
It reminds me of Death Note when he goes I take a potato chip

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,780
solve equations with my right hand and write names with my left

65
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll take a potato chip

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,500
AND EAT

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:04:09,520
If F.R.I.E.N.D.S were an Indian soap opera

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,940
My god, oh my god, this clip Brad is gonna Brad, Brad 2

69
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,680
- it's gonna have to do some proper censoring here

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,420
If you wanna go then you go to hell and go down

71
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,540
Why you get wild man?!

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,310

Bloody bloody bastard running the light here.

84

It's absolutely beautiful.India, it's just a country filled with memes. It's absolutely beautiful.

87
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,390
We have a Ravi posting on Facebook believe in yourself

88
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:21,820
And he he made his own book called greatest people and he placed it next to

89
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,540
all these other

90
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,960
Famous people's books. Someone commented &quot;cool&quot;. He says &quot;yes, am proud of me&quot;

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,420
*laughs*

92
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,370

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,460
just like the same size of the pupils.

98
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:08,620
&quot;Felix you can't do an Indian accent because Apu is racist

99
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:22,060
Who cares! Super funny action scenes of Bollywood movies, okay bring it on

100

So, this is a film apparently

116
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,120
No, he came to meet someone over here

117
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,520
So I'm just here to pick up my wallet because I forgot my wallet in his car

118
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,800
I can see a driver's license -you can pull it up. -Okay, and this is not yours? -I don't know if that was identification.

119
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,100
- Uh, What is this? -I have no clue!

120
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,370
Your story's still a little scattered do you have anything else illegal on your socks shoes anything like that? -No, okay

121
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,770
I know you're high okay. -I smoke weed

122
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,410
You're higher than you think? -No

123
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:44,040
No, it's because when I woke up I seen the lights and stuff and I think you guys I got nervous

124
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,140
I had a monster drink idk if that does it.

125
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,780
yeah yeah yeah he just had a monster.

126
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,440
Your tongues pasty white

127
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,360

133
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,590
All he did was have a monster energy drink and a kebab

134
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,840
This is the sort of racist discrimination

135
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,820
That poor and marginalized groups face every single day in America

136
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,200
date a girl who wears glasses

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,500
It's like dating two girls when she takes them off

138
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Akaash says wash off the makeup and then you can date three women

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:53,120

142
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:16,700
