00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,000
[Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,170
right out of the gate movie is a dick to

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,820
people with epilepsy also why are there

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,559
metal detectors outside the school

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,059
splurge on weather resistant metal

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,800
detectors or is this just some idiotic

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,570
plot device to make Shawn look like more

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,100
of a badass when it actually just makes

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,510
him look like he favors large belt

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,250
buckles how was the fucking mascot kid

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,420
able to fit through the metal detector

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,710
in the first place and why does he

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,090
already have all in the mascot costume

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,529
did he wear it at home and then drive to

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,150
school with his gun this teacher writes

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,560
some masks on the mark of a word and

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,910
then walks over to this other marker

18
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,620
board and simply it's Monday on it then

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,210
goes back to the map also this is the

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,739
most complicated series of instructions

21
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,260
for 8 x equals 72 I've ever seen I mean

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,480
X is 9 goddammit it's that simple and

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,980
she not only writes the same equation

24
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,360
down twice for some reason but she's

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
also making solving for x the most

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,700
confusing thing ever

27
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,200
who since one for the racist Indian

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
mascot and a second one for the racist

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,399
Indian pinata so it's come to this the

30
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,289
Fast &amp; Furious franchise unable to get

31
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,879
Paul Walker Vin Diesel and others to

32
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,379
come back for a third movie rated home

33
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,180
improvement 4 star 7 years after that

34
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,770
show went off the air Sean goes to a

35
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,390
fancy school where they offer slo-mo car

36
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,739
repair as an elective giving him an

37
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,909
unfair advantage to star in this

38
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,470
franchise if they aren't painting him

39
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,760
purple to make him look like grimace

40
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,930
then this is a terrible waste of

41
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,280
bullying this movie was written this

42
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
asshole football player carries around a

43
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,490
spare baseball just in case Lucas black

44
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,259
from Slingblade talks to his girlfriend

45
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,670
and needs to smash his window with it

46
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,380
also this kid certainly has one hell of

47
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,030
an arm he's able to completely bust

48
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,470
through the rear windshield of this car

49
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,420
just by throwing a baseball also also

50
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,189
also the ball went through the rear

51
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,689
windshield passed through a wormhole

52
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,310
that exists in the back seat then came

53
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,020
out behind the car this movie took great

54
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,460
pains to show us that Shawn had put the

55
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,259
wrench back in the toolbox so what is

56
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:34,920
this supposed to be

57
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,509
it's either the dumbest misdirection in

58
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,159
the movies first five minutes ever or

59
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,659
it's a continuity error either way it's

60
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,010
sinful as winner gets

61
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:50,120
me mean sexy and all but also the movie

62
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,560
thinks it can avoid the women are prized

63
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,180
to be one criticism by having this girl

64
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,190
volunteer herself as the prize no one's

65
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,510
working in this large development during

66
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,340
a weekday either this subdivision really

67
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,870
feels the effects of the housing market

68
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,920
crash two years before it actually

69
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,050
happened or the symbol this truck that

70
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,640
is not part of the race is able to keep

71
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,960
up with two cars that are custom built

72
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
to go fast

73
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
back in 2006 there were many issues

74
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,220
people faced every day and we dealt with

75
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,750
them the best we could but two movies

76
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,210
cars and the Fast and Furious 3 made

77
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,680
clear that many Americans suffered from

78
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,150
the embarrassing inability to drift

79
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,130
these movies need to explain how when

80
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,870
Sean was way behind he caught up in a

81
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,130
matter of seconds but now that he's

82
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,330
caught up and on a completely different

83
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,950
Road he can't pass the guy he's so

84
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,980
easily caught up to this prompts clay to

85
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,060
do the thing he should have done ten

86
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,740
minutes ago drive faster than the other

87
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,600
guy Sean bust through a framed house

88
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,100
with little to no damage to his car

89
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,960
because his car only sustains damage

90
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,310
when it's convenient to the plot they

91
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,380
survive this and Sean survives all this

92
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,940
this seems like an awkward time for a

93
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,620
Tabasco product placement movie wait a

94
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,940
minute who was in position to record

95
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,590
this when Sean did his stunts there was

96
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,270
no one around with a camera only one set

97
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,620
of parents show up for clay and Cindy

98
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,820
which makes me think that they're

99
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,470
brother and sister so now I'm in some

100
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,760
kind of Flowers in the Attic subplot

101
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,959
that's way more interesting than Sean

102
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,070
moving to Tokyo and learning how to

103
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,959
drive sideways so where are we moving

104
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,550
this time why does everyone seem to

105
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,900
think you can avoid being prosecuted for

106
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,310
a crime by moving to a different city

107
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,930
this kid broke several laws they can

108
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,010
move on they want but he'll still have

109
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,540
to go to before a judge in the town

110
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,010
where he committed the crimes in case

111
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,480
you confused it with Tokyo french guiana

112
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,580
sean is upset that his single adult dad

113
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,380
has a woman over because if Sean isn't

114
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,640
getting laid then no one should get laid

115
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,880
but your mom she said the 7c we're a day

116
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,800
ahead of you in Japan which would mean

117
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
it's the eighth in Japan which would

118
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,040
mean the seventh came and went and you

119
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
weren't at all concerned that your son

120
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
didn't show up at the airport yeah but

121
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,390
which train how does he get to the

122
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,310
station which one is his stop doesn't

123
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,570
need to make transfers can I read the

124
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,130
signs to be able to buy a ticket so many

125
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,780
questions left by this note Sean makes

126
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,440
it to school without getting lost ish ah

127
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,850
no one is even slightly concerned that

128
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,650
Sean speaks basically no Japanese and is

129
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,000
still expected to be successful at a

130
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,860
Japanese high school Sean grimaces at

131
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,580
what looks delicious

132
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,900
did he already forget what American

133
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,820
school lunches look like you sell on

134
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,500
Sparco Stan well the steering wheel

135
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,090
isn't inside his bag because writing

136
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,350
meaningful dialogue that would reveal

137
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,940
their mutual interest in cars would be

138
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,890
way too much work Twiggy's ride is an

139
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,269
Incredible Hulk themed Volkswagen

140
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:56,870
minivan

141
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,099
because he thinks the name of this

142
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,690
franchise is the function and the

143
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,239
spaciousness from when you blow your wad

144
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,980
man everyone loves semen jokes this

145
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,659
large group of car enthusiasts somehow

146
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,010
has the ability to take over this entire

147
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,840
parking garage at night convenient cute

148
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,790
girl we saw at school earlier who also

149
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,349
shows up to the late-night street races

150
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,450
is convenient Nilo right here quick

151
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,310
Elena being able to recall one person's

152
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,870
name is hardly indicative of learning

153
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,130
speed I see that's funny because I

154
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,750
thought this was like a free country is

155
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,100
this guy supposed to be our protagonist

156
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,780
because he's really been nothing but a

157
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,250
dick the whole new day if you saw this

158
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,449
dude from any other characters

159
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,560
perspective you'd understand why

160
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,270
everyone else is a dick back to it you

161
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,130
know who I am my you like the Justin

162
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,930
Timberlake of Japan hi man this movie

163
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,550
can't even get its insult right future

164
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,199
sex love sounds was a mere three months

165
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,550
away and it took the piss right out of

166
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,830
this insult in record time

167
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,750
the Mafia this is really Twinkies fault

168
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,160
for not briefing Shawn on the potential

169
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,990
gang activity in this parking garage the

170
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,760
other one that's not kids evidence

171
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,100
unless race didn't we see the entire

172
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,660
last 13 minutes of this movie in the

173
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,280
first 12 minutes is this like Groundhog

174
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,350
Day and no one told me take mine this is

175
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,580
the worst decision this guy will make

176
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,710
today wanna see what the kids got and I

177
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,270
have gobs of disposable income an

178
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,190
insanely good car insurance so I don't

179
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,870
care if he beats the out of my car you

180
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,780
know a DK stands for King dream Shawn

181
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,460
who is a car and racing enthusiast

182
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,870
doesn't know what drifting is forcing

183
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,460
the movie to explain it to him and me

184
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,110
and you you know that real famous

185
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,820
painting the one and a woman who smiling

186
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,830
on the Mona Lisa come on you're telling

187
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,419
me this dude didn't know what the Mona

188
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,220
Lisa was called I mean for Christ's sake

189
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,539
pick something different for him to be

190
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,099
ignorant about this car right here's

191
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,870
like the Mona Lisa a drift worth and

192
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,039
even though Shawn has never drifted

193
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,660
before they still let him drive it this

194
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,099
guy is eating out of a magical Mary

195
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,780
Poppins bag of croutons that never runs

196
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,310
out it's literally insane that Shawn

197
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,510
doesn't kill anyone during this race

198
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,949
with his lack of drift knowledge and all

199
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,630
by the way how is Shawn even close right

200
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,310
now this guy is drifting all over his

201
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,930
ass and Shawn crashed like twice but

202
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,580
here he is making it some kind of a race

203
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,050
it's amazing this movie wasn't more

204
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,430
successful it took something really cool

205
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,050
racing and made it look like someone

206
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,250
aggressively trying to find a parking

207
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,720
spot Shawn decides to keep racing

208
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,310
instead of stopping and saying you know

209
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,479
what you've clearly won this round

210
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,919
because I don't know how to do this so

211
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,150
I'm gonna go and learn how to drift

212
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,560
during a five minute montage and we'll

213
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,479
try again next week if an asshole drifts

214
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,979
up a spiral ramp and no one can see him

215
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,840
is he still an asshole the answer is yes

216
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,969
Shawn loses the race and wrecks Hans car

217
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,349
which is exactly the kind of Purple

218
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,849
Reign or eight my own kind of conflict

219
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,449
this movie needs will he ever learn to

220
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,249
after win respect watch those other two

221
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,439
movies to find out human race and shine

222
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,090
don't lie to me I can smell it on your

223
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,099
breath this isn't a game if you're gonna

224
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,529
live under my roof you're gonna go by my

225
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,219
rules

226
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,229
oh man movie just unlock the secret

227
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,699
cliche prize box tell them what they've

228
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,860
won Jeremy thanks Jeremy Moody you have

229
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,479
won an additional ten sins for all the

230
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,219
cliches in this movie there's a guy in

231
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,930
there with the paw that owes me some

232
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,819
money how hard would it be to say this

233
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,620
guy is a paw tattoo on his shoulder han

234
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,270
decides to be needlessly cryptic to

235
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,099
create this unsatisfying reveal han is

236
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,539
making a convincing case to change the

237
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,520
Apple asshole sin to nondescript bag of

238
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,319
snacks basically working the same magic

239
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,759
here movie continues the tradition of

240
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,229
this franchise putting its cars on roads

241
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,360
where there is no traffic I call you

242
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,189
show only if you teach me how to drift

243
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,050
the Senate negotiation how was it

244
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,539
negotiated okay so I'd be happy to teach

245
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,770
you how to drift in my spare time that

246
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,300
as long as it's not a negotiation

247
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,800
what's your language context clues and

248
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,419
tonal inflection all suggested I am

249
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,310
totally down with the drift lessons geez

250
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,629
let me state for the record that Sung

251
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,490
Kang is the most aural actor in history

252
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,710
really stop following me around

253
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,059
neela is attracted to show on for

254
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,409
several reasons but mostly because the

255
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,439
screenwriter told to let me guess your

256
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,029
moves around a lot

257
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,979
why do all these army kids go to regular

258
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,300
Japanese high school isn't there a

259
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,009
special army kid english-speaking school

260
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,360
they can all attend and why are you

261
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,770
letting me race is your DK's kryptonite

262
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,169
why though he's been here for maybe a

263
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,490
week and all he's done is severely

264
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,620
underperforming one goddamn race can do

265
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,330
better than 180 can it can catch you

266
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,560
they ever find out they can bring in

267
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,300
other cop cars to block them off or use

268
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,800
helicopters to track speeders they'll be

269
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,389
unstoppable movie totally thinks it's

270
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,490
the Good Fellas of drift movies ok cars

271
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,779
are great and all but I have trouble

272
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,430
believing that a heterosexual 18 year

273
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,810
old dude can take his eyes off two

274
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,009
beautiful women who are giving him

275
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,819
attention to go look at some cars

276
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,779
crashing this dude's car was the best

277
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,249
thing Shawn could ever do in his life

278
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:52,169
why is this asshole being taught to

279
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,789
drift on a dock are there no empty

280
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:54,810
parking lots where you can practice

281
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,470
leash

282
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,880
did they want him to stop the fight why

283
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,790
don't they just grab a teacher I would

284
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,870
like to pause in the middle of this

285
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,250
fight to tell you why we're fighting in

286
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,850
the first place

287
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,560
you know in case any students / film

288
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,630
goers don't know what this is about spit

289
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,340
fisting so how'd you end up over here

290
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,720
anyway well you know there's old

291
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,970
westerns the Cowboys make a run for the

292
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,780
border it's my Mexico oh also Han

293
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,670
continues to be insanely cryptic because

294
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,530
creating an identifiable backstory for

295
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,370
this character would be way too

296
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,810
challenging and would get in the way of

297
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,310
all the establishing shots of brightly

298
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,780
colored cars and pretty girls it's a

299
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,150
trust and character I need around me you

300
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,919
choose to be around you but you know who

301
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,750
you are or who you're forcing to be with

302
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,130
you because he wrecked your car and you

303
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,110
need him to pay off the debt that to one

304
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,940
car in exchange for knowing what a man's

305
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,770
made oh that's a price I can live with

306
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,570
so having Shawn wreck your car proves to

307
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,680
you that he's reckless cocky and

308
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,030
possibly stupid I guess those are all

309
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,290
the qualities of character he's looking

310
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,780
for so if you don't drift away in what

311
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,060
do you joyful holy Sh this movie is a

312
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,500
stone's throw from Disney's brink

313
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,620
[Music]

314
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,209
you know you can also say hello to meet

315
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,069
women that also works also drift

316
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,259
seduction also how many tires do you go

317
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,730
through per day to keep up a drifting

318
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,030
habit

319
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,730
[Music]

320
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,980
all of that just to get a number sorry

321
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,990
setup is required for simple digits than

322
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,430
count me out of the dating pool and

323
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,290
drift world first dress to his advantage

324
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,760
drifting out you in the mounds my

325
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,500
feeling they lived in a terrible feudal

326
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,760
society where they had to drift for

327
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,930
their leashes in order to keep their

328
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,970
lands also Han leaves out all the

329
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,529
crucial technique needed to actually

330
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,449
drift but yeah just feel it and see how

331
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:30,850
that goes again does he mean repeat this

332
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,500
shot again because we've seen it three

333
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,529
times the guys learn so much when are we

334
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,910
ever gonna stop fishing and get married

335
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,290
this movie expects me to believe that

336
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,910
Shawn was able to learn drifting at an

337
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,410
expert level in a matter of months and

338
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,940
is able to beat these guys that have

339
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,470
been doing it for presumably several

340
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,240
years this guy needs to take a drift

341
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,000
management class I realize now outsider

342
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,190
an insider doesn't really matter all the

343
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,690
matters knowing what you really want

344
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,269
going after and serendipitously crashing

345
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,769
some stranger's car who happens to take

346
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,720
you under his wing helps to also Shawn

347
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,250
knows what he wants he wants to win a

348
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,480
drifting race just for the sake of

349
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,820
winning one synchronize drifting we see

350
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,709
come up here little kids even before we

351
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,930
could drive we cut class sneak out come

352
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,389
up here what's the only kids drift so

353
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,949
before you could drive you used to come

354
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,269
up here to the looking mountains to

355
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,920
watch people drift how did that thing

356
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,089
happen did you hike up here

357
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,769
or did you Marty McFly and hitch a ride

358
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,089
on someone's car while on a skateboard

359
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,399
also even while drifting Neela is able

360
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,079
to softly whisper this story to Sean and

361
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,550
Sean seems to understand every word

362
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,220
oh come on man look are you telling me

363
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,600
that Sean saw this dude get out of his

364
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,070
car saw him start walking angrily

365
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,570
towards him and didn't think to run

366
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,070
defend himself or otherwise prepare for

367
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,430
a fight

368
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,430
stay away from although only the Uni

369
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,470
diving is a good jab I'll help you beat

370
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,670
out of him if he promised me a

371
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,640
wheelchair drifting montage do you know

372
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,310
Dean hey I'm starting to think all the

373
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,750
dialogue in this movie was constructed

374
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,310
like a ransom note using screenplay

375
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,050
clippings of other popular movies like

376
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,339
how Shawn made friends with two other

377
00:10:58,339 --> 00:10:59,450
people in high school and the movie

378
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,829
doesn't explain anything about them or

379
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:01,519
what they have in common

380
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,990
there's enough space for them to just

381
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,700
drive straight away right the drifting

382
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,290
thing is fun and they backed themselves

383
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,519
into a corner by making it the main

384
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,350
reason the movie exists but would it be

385
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,430
way more efficient to just drive

386
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,279
normally even with a good honk warning

387
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,300
you would not be able to clear out a

388
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,649
crowd full of pedestrians and sneak

389
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,180
through some won't hear the honk and

390
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,260
others will be screwed by their fellow

391
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,610
pedestrians and you will kill ten of

392
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,959
them before everything's over chase

393
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,339
scenes with cars like this can be fun

394
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,470
but editing like this is ridiculous

395
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,390
given how fast they're growing I find it

396
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,589
hard to believe they would both be able

397
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,300
to walk away unscathed from this crash

398
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,980
Tom's death scene doesn't include Jason

399
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,750
Statham and yes that's a sin I'm giving

400
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,070
this movie for something that happened

401
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,930
at the end of Fast &amp; Furious 6 franchise

402
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,579
retroactive sinning baby no law

403
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,050
enforcement shows up allowing them to

404
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,370
just walk away and casually get on a

405
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,200
subway DK knew to find them at Shawn's

406
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,790
dance house because he was tipped off by

407
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,649
the screenwriter I wouldn't do that if I

408
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:49,130
were you

409
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,560
neglectful dad ex machina also how did

410
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,970
he get out here in time did his dad

411
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,560
sense tingle and he knew the commotion

412
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,270
outside was related to Shawn like I left

413
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,649
without a note it's been gone for I

414
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,450
don't know let's say three weeks and now

415
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,670
I'm responsible for my mess I got to do

416
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,950
this can someone explain to me what he

417
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,630
has to do exactly is he gonna kill DK

418
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,399
turn himself into police rescue the girl

419
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,200
convinced bow-wow to add the loo back

420
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,480
and Shawn's vagary somehow convinced his

421
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,529
father to let him go do this I guess

422
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:16,820
that's one way to do it if you ignore

423
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,260
all the original mistakes he's made all

424
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,970
by himself also was he saying that

425
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,890
Shawn's mess doesn't at least equal or

426
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,630
exceed the mistakes he's made come the

427
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,550
gone all Shawn's dad did was be a bad

428
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,170
father Shawn's going to be wanted on two

429
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,820
continents after this maybe I should

430
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,380
talk to come on I'll let Twinkie take

431
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,000
this one I know I just didn't hit it you

432
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,040
can't just walk into kamata's place man

433
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,209
it's all I got

434
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,010
so Shawn walks right up to kamata's

435
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,660
place gets shot dead and the movie ends

436
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,920
with 23 minutes of credits

437
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,390
something that they ha would

438
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,100
because I mean if you're gonna make it

439
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,810
out of commonness place of life don't

440
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,440
you need it's cool I figured out wait a

441
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,000
minute Twinkie said this is something I

442
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,380
think Han would have wanted you to have

443
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,149
so did Twinkie mean Han would have

444
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,589
wanted you to take my money isn't it

445
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:55,820
Twinkie who is giving Sean this money

446
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,839
and it has nothing to do with Han

447
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,540
whatsoever the Bailey you can just walk

448
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,950
right up to come out his place who knew

449
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,870
oh no God a mosque the drift training

450
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,640
montage ran long and bumped the learning

451
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,620
Japanese montage I'm here now for you a

452
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,829
peaceful solution is it a race a race EU

453
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,750
movie it costs to cool the cause in

454
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,250
addition to being an unexplained friend

455
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,540
this guy also serves as the narrator

456
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,430
luckily Sean's dad just happens to be

457
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,110
working on a car that could easily be

458
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,790
retrofitted with street racing parts for

459
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,290
this finale to happen this dudes

460
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,850
nickname in the army was God in the

461
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,440
machine is this our third and fourth

462
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,760
montage I lost count

463
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,740
also after Sean requested the race did

464
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,540
he get a full week or so to prepare for

465
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,220
it the accused overlords must have said

466
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,200
I agreed to the race but first get in a

467
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,670
good week to prepare you know what make

468
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,320
it two weeks and here's 50 grand to

469
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,250
start your new business

470
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,440
DK picked his role for a reason this is

471
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,180
his mountain and he's got some barrels

472
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,800
he's gonna throw at you as I see the old

473
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
man get out of the car I'm wondering why

474
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
did he even agree to this this is a

475
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,570
massive waste of time the stakes are

476
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,850
loser leaves town for good so what he

477
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,839
doesn't get anything from that

478
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,160
arrangement Sean I already gave him the

479
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,050
money han owed if he loses he doesn't

480
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,579
die or learn a lesson or have to give

481
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,110
him more money this is a bullsh

482
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,760
man I was hoping this dude was gonna use

483
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,279
his bra to start the race Kyle watching

484
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,779
this on their cellphones even if there

485
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,220
were invisible drones filming it there's

486
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,350
no way those mid-2000s era cellphones

487
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,579
could play back live streaming video

488
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,230
have you ever tried to stream anything

489
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,089
on edge Network that was the fastest

490
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,440
looking thing at the time I know they're

491
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,519
all about drifting but they could easily

492
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,750
turn around some of these corners

493
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,370
normally and as far as I know you don't

494
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,930
get bonus points for style in this race

495
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,920
nor do you get a little power boost

496
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,329
coming out of the slide like in Mario

497
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:22,339
Kart 64 it's just whoever gets to the

498
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,170
bottom first all right and here in this

499
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,579
case who's recording this part of the

500
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,720
action there's no one around to

501
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,610
broadcast this but yet everybody looking

502
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,050
at their phone sure seems to see the

503
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,519
race perfectly clear and their tiny ass

504
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,649
screens this camera move illustrates the

505
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,510
cliff that Sean might tumble over if his

506
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,920
car continues to do what this camera

507
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,050
just did which is to confuse us as to

508
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,730
how far away Sean is from this clip I

509
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,899
couldn't really see what was going on

510
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,310
but I definitely smelled some bullshit

511
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,959
it's too bad I don't know how far away

512
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,310
from the finish line these guys are

513
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,260
giving us a course and some updates on

514
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,279
their status might have made this

515
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,260
exciting DK conveniently and impossibly

516
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,760
falls right in front of where Sean is

517
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
driving only so this shot can exist

518
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,689
and he survives this party's been being

519
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,029
everybody around Asia - well you heard

520
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,009
wrong because Furious 7 makes you a liar

521
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,990
because Dom didn't come to Asia to beat

522
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,339
a whole bunch of people racing he came

523
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,499
here to pick up Han and yes that's not

524
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:07,970
only a retroactive sin for a future

525
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,800
movie but that's also a sin we already

526
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,749
mentioned in the Furious 7 video take

527
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,730
that furious let's do it okay I want to

528
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,889
raise setting new huh and why the fuck

529
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,360
does he want to race why can't they just

530
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,740
sit and talk about their dead friends

531
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,509
because we got two minutes left and that

532
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,279
would require a writing dialogue alright

533
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,740
though I got another good time yep

534
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,999
you're just in the middle of all that

535
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,069
Jason Statham book in Furious 7

536
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:29,779

537
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:42,470
