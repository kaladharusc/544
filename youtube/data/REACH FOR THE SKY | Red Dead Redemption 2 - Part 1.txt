00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,290
hello everybody my name is markiplier

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,529
and welcome to red dead redemption - now

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:05,609
I've been looking forward to this game

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,919
for a long long time because before I

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,559
started YouTube in the transition period

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,230
between when I was not happy and when I

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,010
started making videos I played one game

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,680
one and it was Red Dead Redemption every

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,510
spare moment that I wasn't working on

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,550
some other weird project before I went

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,390
into YouTube

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,430
I was playing Red Dead Redemption it was

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,949
so fun it was so free and I just loved

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,750
the environment of it so I'm going into

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,170
this completely eager to see everything

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,469
but I think you can forgive me for a few

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,649
things number one I will probably be

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,899
doing a lot of cowboy voices I that's

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,489
just a blanket sweep you got to agree to

20
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,350
that's going into this because I don't

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,309
even know if I'm gonna be able to help

22
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,930
it number two I am NOT a console gamer

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,610
and I'm playing this on PlayStation 4 so

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,110
I don't think that I'm going to be any

25
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,050
sort of good at aiming specifically if I

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,579
was mouse and keyboard I would tear this

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,920
shit up three ways from Sunday but as it

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,260
stands I'm playing on a keyboard or

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,540
playing on a controller so forgive me

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,810
when I'm bad at shooting but if I figure

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,939
out a way to get this click keyboard and

32
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,880
mouse setup into the into the old

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,439
PlayStation there I might actually be

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,119
able to do some good but until I can do

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,310
that I'm a stick it to the original way

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,490
that I played it before with the

37
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,830
controller so without further ado I'll

38
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,200
let's get into the story of this

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
by 1899 the age of outlaws and

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,240
gunslingers was at an end there ago the

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,100
first sentence that I read I got to do

42
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,399
it

43
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,119
yeah whatever America was becoming a

44
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,070
land of laws was it now we'll see about

45
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,110
that I think when I step onto the scene

46
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,009
it's not gonna be that easy even the

47
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,190
West had mostly been tamed you know this

48
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,220
is a prequel to the first game I believe

49
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,500
I'm pretty sure that's the story here

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,899
a few gangs still roam but they were

51
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,060
being hunted down and destroyed I like

52
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,380
this it seems like it's written on a

53
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,959
chalkboard it kind of gives that

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,380
educational history lesson feel to it

55
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,569
Rockstar Games presents Red Dead

56
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:33,260
Revolver 3

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,020

58
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,730
god I've been looking forward to this

59
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,440
for a long long time and it's been a

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,050
while since I just sat by and played a

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,310
game I didn't even know if I was gonna

62
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,690
be recording this game because I was so

63
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,239
eager to see it but man I couldn't pass

64
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,500
up oh no we were fooled

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,930
Skyrim again god damn it they keep

66
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,120
remaking it and we keep falling for it

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
oh here we go

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,560
Aaron Garbett I think you've probably

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,879
done a smash-up job here dan Houser

70
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:14,420
Michael whatever that third name I sent

71
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,370
him up if we don't stop soon we'll all

72
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,840
be dying whether it's May I'm just

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,440
hoping the law got as lost as we did

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,860
there Arthur better luck

75
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,350
I found a place where we can get some

76
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,950
shelter let Davi rest well he you know

77
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:49,510
an old man in town man hey come on okay

78
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,060
I'm sure that's good apparently these

79
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,610
guys are some kind of bandits and I

80
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,130
don't know if that's good whoa I love

81
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,600
the styling that's something that I

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,190
gotta say about Red Dead Redemption I

83
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,290
mean the whole Western theme is kind of

84
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,240
an played out in a lot of ways but when

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,370
it comes down to the style of the West

86
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,570
oh oh man it's something to really be

87
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,400
enjoyed chapter one

88

Colter so I got subtitles on everything

89

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,350

Sean Mack they might be okay we don't

114
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:59,710
know but we lost some folks now if I

115
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,939
could throw myself in the ground in

116
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,490
their stead

117
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:12,819
I'd do it gladly but we're gonna ride

118

123
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,909

124
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:39,159

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,400
down the hill

133
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,710
I had time to ask me what really went

134
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,030
down back there on that boat we miss you

135
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:30,330
this with that come on hey horses oh

136
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,160

137
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,000

139
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,889
guy

140
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,870
this guy don't seem like he's doing too

141
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,000
good though this leader guy I think he

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,740
might have been shot at some point also

143
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,590
this is really throwing me because I

144
00:07:52,590 --> 00:08:07,870
just

145
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,870
yeah I just uh I watched or I listened

146
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,090
to a podcast about the Donner Party from

147
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,610
the last podcast on the left and let me

148
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,710
tell you this seems very much like what

149
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,210
they might have had to go through in

150
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,370
terms of cannibalism and even each other

151
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,540
but they didn't have a leader like

152
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,010
whoever I'm playing but it seems like

153
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,510

154
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,210

interesting set piece to move on to

416
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,080
exactly after the initial opening cuz I

417
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,460
didn't know if this game was gonna be

418
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,470
focused on John Marston like the first

419
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,510
game was I mean I think everybody agrees

420
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,310
that when you're playing this game you

421
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,770
kind of need to have that kind of

422
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,440
protagonist I think and spoil alert for

423
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,760

mode on and you hold down the Run button

469
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,870
you'll just automatically follow trails

470
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:44,300
that's so cool to change cinematic movie

471
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:57,380

wait

601
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,059
I think that just made a connection from

602
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,130
the first game was it John Marston

603
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:40,450
looking for Arthur in the first well

604
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,980
Cindy looking for Arthur wasn't it just

605
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,410
like Arthur I think I distinctly

606
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,019
remember that what's that a thing is

607
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:54,220
this the same Arthur man things are

608
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,140
being connected it's been so long since

609
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,390
I played the first Red Dead Redemption I

610
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,859
thought about going back and playing the

611
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,720
first one just to like catch myself up

612
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,089
this is such a long game I didn't think

613
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,079
that I would ever be able to actually

614
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:32,019
get through it so not today you and is

discussing with hair Strauss when the

616
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,680
weather breaks suppose we'll have to

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,549
keep heading east

oh hell yeah I can't believe they go

1072
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:18,100
this gave us so in-depth like it's so

1073
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,600
thought out that's the thing about it

1074
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,330
it's so fought out all the nuanced

1075
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,670
details of it like who spends this much

1076
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,740
time they get out of game and who can

1077
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,830
possibly keep it all in their head

1078
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:32,410
there's so much that's what I don't

1079
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:33,880
understand about game development it's

1080
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,290
just so incredibly incredibly deep

1081
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:39,430
especially games like this that's why

1082
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,290
it's so difficult for like one person or

1083
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,480
even a small team to accomplish it like

1084
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,230
you can sometimes hello

1085
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:51,270
how did we do down here mr. Morgan whoa

1086

1104
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:46,699

look at this game in those hills I'll

1115
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,400

1116
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,679
and you can kill it you need to rest

1117
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,479
Charles you think this is rest

1118
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:21,800

1119
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,800

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,340
keep

1121
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,229
now why do you want to keep him down man

1122
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,090
this this whole group just loves each

1123
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,159
other I think this is what John Marston

1124
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:32,809
was talking about in the first game I

1125
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:35,119
can't use it you'll have to oh you're

1126
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:38,360
joking use a gun and we'll scare off

1127
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:46,340
every animal for miles around but this

1128
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,780
is what John Marston must have been

1129
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,429
talking about about how like the whole

1130
01:14:49,429 --> 01:14:51,619
crew is a family and then things went

1131
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:53,479
wrong that's what this is setting up

1132
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:55,789
right now this is that whole family this

1133
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,800
is everybody that he went to hunt down

1134
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:08,030
is in this group here it'll be fine in a

1135
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:10,190
day or two I just can't pull a boat

1136
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,000
right now yeah

1137
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,260
I never really got the hang of it you'll

1138
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:22,140
be fine so you reckon we're gonna find

1139
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,210
something to kill it ain't no Driscoll

1140
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,670

1141
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:27,180
sure

1142
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,560
Pearson doesn't know what he's talking

1143
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,870
about now the weather's eased off a bit

1144
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:35,370
they'll be needing two feet it's still

1145
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:37,110
cool I got it's so cool

1146
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:38,760
I keep getting enraptured just by the

1147
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,220
the visuals of it like how pretty it was

1148
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:45,840
cuz it is my god but also like God it's

1149
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,840
so weird because I'm getting a little

1150
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,990
bit icky suppose you've had a lock put

1151
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,980
on you I wish I could have done more I

1152
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,770
didn't mean it like that just learn to

1153
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:04,470
think back home I still don't really

1154
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:12,920
know what happened on that boat

1155
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,590
[Music]

1156
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,910
Edge's it automatically I didn't do that

1157
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:18,440
they must know that we're in for a long

1158
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,350
trip but it's so cool because I'm

1159
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:23,330
getting bits and pieces of this story a

1160
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:25,010
little bit at a time which is great

1161
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,990
because I like it when a story is so

1162
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,610
strewn out and it's not like anybody

1163
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,230
needs to tell the expedition this is

1164
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:32,060
just life like that's the cool thing

1165
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,950
about the stories it is so immersive and

1166
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,210
it feels like you're just a part of the

1167
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,980
experience like that's what I love about

1168
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,440
it and that's all this is struggle I

1169
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,240
mean not that I want to live in these

1170
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,130
times but there's something romanticized

1171
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,740
about it that's just like man living off

1172
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,770
the land eaten salted big testicles oh

1173
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,930
look at the horse balls as you go

1174
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,720
through the the snowy Tundra yes

1175
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,450
beautiful it's beautiful also if you

1176
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,070
didn't know I'm not joking about the

1177
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,690
horse balls thing they literally

1178
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,850
animated the horse testicles into this

1179
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:07,550
game because people complained about the

1180
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:11,300
last time of course like that one scene

1181
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,740
where the guy grabs the horse bowl

1182
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:28,160
healthy healthy horse okay but then like

1183
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,690
there's no horse balls any other time

1184
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:32,630
but if I look down I think I can spy me

1185
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:36,670
some horse testicles

1186
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:38,270
there's the balls

1187
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:47,360
I think I saw balls those balls we get a

1188
01:17:47,360 --> 01:18:09,980
good sneaking look okay don't mind me

1189
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,870
being weird I'm just trying to inspect

1190
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:14,840
the health of my horse turns out a very

1191
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,500

down here to do this feel like me coming

1539

they could just run for it what what's

1746
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:46,130
their incentive not to just run for

1747
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,810

01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:56,390
I mean I'm capable but also at the same

1751
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:58,610
time it feels like that might be a

1752
01:55:58,610 --> 01:56:03,530
little unfair huh I ain't so sure about

1753

1756
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:29,290
I'm a little confused about the

1757
01:56:29,290 --> 01:56:31,270
execution of that strategy but okay

1758
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:37,620

01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:54,159
[Music]

1782
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:57,030
Oh

1783
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:58,380
[Music]

1784
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:06,820
Oh

1785
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:08,660
so pretty

1786
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:11,239
god is so pretty that's the thing like I

1787
01:58:11,239 --> 01:58:12,950
just cannot get over how pretty the

1788
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:14,630
series and I think the game developers

1789
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:16,219
probably knew that like the play testers

1790
01:58:16,219 --> 01:58:17,360
going through this over and over again

1791
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,340
over like every time it gets a little

1792
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,380
bit better they're just like my god that

1793
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:25,680
is flippin beautiful

1794
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:28,950
I just love it when a something comes

1795
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,990
together and I know it's probably the

1796
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:32,640
product of a lot of overworked employees

1797
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:42,510
and a lot of like very question I mean

1798
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:45,540
with the boy just go come on kids you

1799
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:52,710
can buy me a whiskey

1800
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:55,920
this is feel right you know

1801
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,499
feels like it's the work of tried

1802
01:58:59,499 --> 01:59:03,019
because you know this game like it's not

1803
01:59:03,019 --> 01:59:04,760
designed in the same way that a lot of

1804
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,550
games are that they're supposed to be

1805
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:10,460
just this like epic thing that you know

1806
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,590
everybody can grow accustomed to III

1807
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:14,539
feel like this almost started as a niche

1808
01:59:14,539 --> 01:59:17,929
thing but god I'm so happy about it but

1809
01:59:17,929 --> 01:59:19,460
