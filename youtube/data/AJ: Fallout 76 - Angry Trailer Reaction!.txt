11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,960
interesting viral marketing there from

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,030
Bethesda they've just announced leave

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,260
the trailer together I gotta say though

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,940
they started this thing out by doing

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,769
like what four five hours eight hours

17
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:53,500
stream of just nothing and people were

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,739
watching it shouting for it was like two

19
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,589
thousand concurrent viewers down to even

20
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:02,019
six sixty five thousand people were

21
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,519
watching it in the middle of the night

22
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,649
while I was doing nothing luckily I

23
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,590
caught some of the action as we were

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,880
streaming something else and I was

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,710
switching back and forth so we caught a

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,930
little bit of this passing on private

27
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:32,289
property what the fuck is going on what

28
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:37,170
is that you guys seeing this

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,440

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,520

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,069
got a little death thing Todd is trying

32
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,709

33
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:59,220
that is dead just fuckin with people's

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,069
fuck so yeah it was just they're just

35
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,259
they just would be able to just screwing

36
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,149
with people and doing a little comfort

37
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,580

67
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,190
by for too long

68
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:02,640
very very big

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,160
[Music]

70
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,000
thank you

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,180
I think that is the song that was in

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,310
Fallout 3 so at first I thought that

73
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,320
this was gonna be fallout 3 remastered

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,470
yeah if you notice there's that that

75
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,570
date right there is kind of a little

76
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,510
earlier than a lot of other vaults that

77
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,920
opened so that's pre you know vault

78
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,290
opening and people coming out so that

79
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,150
that's a Stinney little clue right there

80
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,160
at least if they're paying attention to

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:44,570
dates I don't know

82
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,360
for games I love uh game so it looks

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,430
very similar to fighting a stop you must

84
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,620
rebuild I'm pretty sure that's super

85
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,220
important the engine looks very similar

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,960
fallout 4 looks like they're just using

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,140
the same assets invited adding a few

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,320
more here I'm gonna pause it here notice

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
it says reclamation day over here in the

90
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,270
background and the vault is empty so and

91
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,340
there's like a party like yeah now we're

92
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,660
opening the vault so I'm pretty sure

93
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,340
this is a part where they're opening the

94
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,840
ball and since there's nobody's here

95
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,640
you're gonna go out into the world it's

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,159
what I'm assuming let's see more

97
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:36,000
got the old bit boy 76 our future begins

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
all right fallout 76 and release date no

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,780
release date there's Pete so yes troll

100
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,220
eNOS all right

101
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,220
so okay guys so let's go through this

102
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,020
real quick or here so what do you think

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,810
of the trailer Joe super tease yeah I'm

104
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,580
not really much to go on actually to

105
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,650
make a video out of but because fallout

106
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,449
3 follow a lot of assumptions is one of

107
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,270
my favorite series now I did not expect

108
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:19,509
to fall out so soon you know yeah what

109
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,669
it is Joe well there's still hope for

110
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,770
that at the at the conference because

111
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,629
they do one fallout then they do a

112
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,190
Skyrim then they do a fallout then they

113
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,840
do a Skyrim on the main line at least

114
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,000
that's what I've Skyrim Elder Scrolls

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,159
and so I think in that Elder Scrolls is

116
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,449
next but to get this it's not a mainline

117
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,990
Fallout game it's not fallout 5 so it's

118
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,509
like something extra and this is why I'm

119
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,789
super happy with this because we get

120
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,310
this out of nowhere and so what if what

121
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,710
people did right away is they win and

122
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,860
they went on to the to the wiki here to

123
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,919
find out what fallout 76 is and if you

124
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,259
go to the wiki and you actually look at

125
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,490
vault 76 not all the vaults were

126
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,349
experimentals this when they're screwing

127
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,669
with them and doing like gladiatorial

128
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,860
games and things like that some of them

129
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,960
were control vaults and this one was a

130
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,610
control vault where they leave him alone

131
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,729
and they'd let them live and it's

132
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,930
there's 500 occupants vault 76 house 500

133
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,969
and it was programmed to open to the

134
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,580
wasteland outside 20 years after a

135
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,879
nuclear war so that is kind of what we

136
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,210
have to go off of occupants 500 what I'm

137
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,360
hoping that is is you know the number of

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,399
players so a lot of people are thinking

139
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,000
and via leaks that this is going to be a

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,120
multiplayer game

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,630
in the vein of like a rust or an arc or

142
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,550
a conan those kinds of games and one

143
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,550
particular guy was was saying you know

144
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,590
that he has evidence to support this

145
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,110
idea or people that he's heard of that

146
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,290
look if you're getting hyped for a

147
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,160
single-player RPG you gonna be

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,740
disappointed this is an online game you

149
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,470
know what I'm okay with that but I don't

150
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,919
normally I like single-player I'll sing

151
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,470
I want RPG I want to create myself want

152
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,169
to do all that stuff in Fallout 5 but

153
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,110
think of this as an additional game that

154
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,190
we're getting out of the blue because

155
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,010
and get this is made in Austin Austin

156
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:29,060
Texas Joe we got to go over there look

157
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,580
into the windows to see if we can find

158
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,440
out more it but there's one shiny

159
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,750
there's a site right but so so this

160
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,659
studio was actually making I think it

161
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,789
was like an online battle arena game I

162
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,770
can't even remember the name that's how

163
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,410
you know you could tell how well it was

164
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,440
gonna do battle ride battle something

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,170
and they decided to cancel it and it's

166
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,220
injured because I was like where's that

167
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,170
game I we never got that game was

168
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,850
cancelled and then they move I guess

169
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,440
they moved this team over to develop

170
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,120
this game and they're doing it in

171
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,950
conjunction with the main studio over

172
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,089
there in Maryland so I'm excited what do

173
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,029
you think I'm actually gonna agree with

174
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,190
you it's gonna be an online game is

175
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,930
online yeah it's it's gonna be an online

176
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,610
game a lot of people thinking that it's

177
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,950
gonna be vault only like it's evolved

178
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,080
like it no are you are you dumb

179
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,120
are you stupid you can't have fallout

180
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,839
without exploring the wasteland it's it

181
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,240
would be the most sporty exactly even

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,730
fallout shelter the mobile game I mean

183
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,230
though you don't experience they send

184
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,660
now send them out they get materials and

185
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,550
then come back and that's what this game

186
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,260
should be if it's like a rust clone

187
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,500
where you go out you find materials and

188
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,370
then you build in the vault now I get

189
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,020
you know do you think the let people

190
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,000
build outside of the vault within that

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,890
kind of mates the vault pointless right

192
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,620
so I don't know but the to the people to

193
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,010
think

194
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,600
the vault is gonna be closed the whole

195
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,940
time and it will open hell no I mean I

196
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,190
that I what's not it's very I mean I

197
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,870
guess you could put up barricades and

198
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,760
machine-gun emplacements in certain

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,280
hallways so there wouldn't people but no

200
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,860
I mean kind of an interesting idea like

201
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm the food sector and I'm the water

202
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,000
sector and you gotta grab stuff from me

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,350
but I don't think that's what it is I

204
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,680
think it's it's literally how do 500

205
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,880
people get get along you know without a

206
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,640
control without the evil vault pack you

207
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,460
know screwing with them the evil is

208
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,010
gonna come from Dell and and and you

209
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:42,890
Lord to shanks oh yeah see I'm kind of

210
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,530
excited for it like we'll join forces

211
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,410
if you shanks is Joe's character for

212
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,480
Fallout where he just went melee only

213
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,090
and the only weapon II accept it took

214
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,330
out the whole place with some shanks so

215
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,530
when you think about it like that we're

216
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,560
kind of excited about it at leap I mean

217
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,780
it came out of nowhere you know I did

218
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,640
not expect the game and it's already on

219
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,700
my top 10 list of most anticipated games

220
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,190
of e3 so I'll make a video top 10 most

221
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,980
anticipated games of e3 coming up but I

222
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,010
will say from Bethesda this is not the

223
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,370
one I was low is not the one right now

224
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,290
that I'm most excited about I want to

225
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,440
hear about it yeah I want to hear about

226
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,170
starfield Joe which I hear is like a no

227
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,380
space RPG from Bethesda of course like

228
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,090
let's make a third one pathetic you've

229
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,310
got Elder Scrolls and you got Fall Out

230
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,130
Loud lets could you imagine space i know

231
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,070
III it sounds too good to be true cuz

232
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,960
you know how in love I am with that kind

233
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,270
of stuff so we'll just see and I'm not

234
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,820
so star filled and then of course the

235
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,440
Elder Scrolls series which is my

236
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,920
favorite RPG franchise of all time

237
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,440
saying so I would literally cream my

238
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,270
pants if that's what was having I was

239
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,650
sitting in the chair and they show that

240
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,380
of it I'll have to I'll have to like you

241
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,110
know do my phone here and do a V log so

242
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,230
alright big bright light ball out seven

243
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,030
fallout 76

244
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,300
we are predicting here via the leaks via

245
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,130
what we saw there that you're gonna be

246
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,710
creating little rooms and gathering

247
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,660
materials and then building stuff within

248
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,480
your area of the vault but you're gonna

249
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,640
be going out and experiencing the

250
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,220
wasteland and having conflict there how

251
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,230
exactly it's gonna work I don't know we

252
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,120
gotta wait for the conference but does

253
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,860
that make you guys excited or do you

254
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,380
think they're a little bit too late to

255
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,750
this survival party cuz this is one of

256
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,580
the ones that is coming in after we've

257
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,040
had the survival explosion and I think

258
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,630
survival games are kind of on their way

259
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,460
in downward but I don't know that's just

260
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,610
my opinion is fallout 76 gonna add

261
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,260
something to the formula that is - it

262
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,490
can't just be a carpet just gonna be

263
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,110
like stagnant so they have to do

264
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,650
something

265
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,600
come on Austin studio well here's what

266
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,430
I'm thinking if they just told him

267
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,140
cancel that game quickly make this game

268
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,180
and there are already announcing it I

269
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,860
mean I feel like maybe it's gonna be a

270
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,780
little bit of a rush job and it's not

271
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,240
gonna really add anything unique so I'm

272
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,860
just setting your expectations just

273
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,230
setting my expectations but we'll

274
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,940
definitely hammer on it if that's what

275
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,589
it is here at the end of Joe show so

276
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,110
just wanted to bring you more current

277
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,080
news stories as they break don't really

278
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,930
care you know if this gets seen a whole

279
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,640
lot but we want to give our opinion on

280
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,350
this here's my thing so we can refer to

281
