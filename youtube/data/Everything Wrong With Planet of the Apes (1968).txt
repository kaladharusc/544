[Music]

2
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:11,040
even in 1968 the Fox logo took 15

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,080
goddamn seconds proving this logo was a

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,460
long-standing Hollywood tradition of

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,039
bullying audiences and that completes my

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,170
final report until we reach touchdown

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,830
Aryan touch my crew in for the long

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,090
sleep I'll be joining so Heaven's Gate

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,470
why didn't ask to make the spacecraft

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,750
soundproof apparently even in 1968 it

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,279
was an acceptable future for astronauts

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,930
to be smoking a goddamn cigar in the

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,300
shuttle family even in 1968 was an

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,680
acceptable future for astronauts to

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,150
place their cigar right next to

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,010
flammable raw material okay wait this

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,420
guy woke up from crowd sleep left a

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,100
voice message for mentioning the people

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,270
who set him on this mission are all

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,040
surely dead suggesting he's been in cryo

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,810
sleep a while moles around a moment then

22
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,790
puts himself back into Kraus we don't

23
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,360
have that right

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,470
I guess NASA didn't give this movie

25
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,880
permission to use their name so the

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,470
filmmakers took this newfound grade of

27
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,450
Liberty to switch to letters nearly two

28
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,680
minutes of opening credits that do

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,490
nothing for nobody

30
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,050
thankfully these crabs sleep pods open

31
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,160
with the ship encounters a problem

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,530
something 2016's passengers couldn't

33
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,710
even get right Stewart that is one of

34
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,210
the weirdest cuts in all the history of

35
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,480
film editing ah 1960s on centered zoomed

36
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,460
high 1960s horror movie screeching the

37
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,810
only reason this hibernation chamber is

38
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,220
cracked and the others aren't is because

39
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,750
it was that motherfucker Chris Pratt

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,210
wasn't it also on the late 60s when the

41
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,830
only major female human character is

42
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,360
casually killed before even having a

43
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,890
line in fact they didn't even need to

44
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,450
hire actress for this role just used a

45
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,340
prop goddamn other than the two weird

46
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,810
minutes of opening exposition this

47
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,250
movie's opening 25 minutes are actually

48
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,930
fantastic disorienting without

49
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,490
explaining too much long takes with

50
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,230
little to no dialogue somebody's way

51
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,430
better than you remember it being is

52
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,040
what I'm saying two sins off yes okay

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,350
thank God I mean it's earth but you

54
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,850
don't know that so here is this is

55
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,440
luckier you just Christ landed on a

56
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,170
planet with air you can breathe baby

57
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,640
15 seconds of this guy giving

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
play-by-play about the inevitable ship

59
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,150
sinking you didn't have time to read the

60
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,220
tapes this will be a convenient out for

61
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,720
the movie so that these astronauts won't

62
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
suspect they're on earth but somehow it

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,479
doesn't have time to check the basic

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,110
information

65
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,790
I guess answer really is a discount NASA

66
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,299
that food water amounts right three-day

67
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,399
your emergency bailout of your spaceship

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,319
metallic backpacks have three days of

69
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,630
rations that's it do I even bother

70
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,180
packing emergency ration pack

71
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,799
and apart from that you look pretty

72
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,469
chipper for a man who's 2,031 years old

73
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,329
this dick waited until now to tell these

74
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,790
guys the year like whole raft ride over

75
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,319
here he said man I can't wait to spring

76
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,700
this fact on these assholes I'm

77
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,709
wondering that's my motto it's a fact

78
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,480
Landon with the fake background behind

79
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,629
me right now well there's no life here

80
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,780
we've got just 72 hours to find it what

81
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,519
did you just say no seriously let's

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,650
spell it out again for posterity there's

83
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,439
no life here we've got just 72 hours to

84
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,069
find it

85
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,989
notice this flag god help you if you

86
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:52,730
don't hey guys so like I was saying this

87
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,079
looks like the western United States

88
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,340
right doesn't look like the western

89
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,870
United States surely they would have no

90
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,489
planet they were going to with the Sun

91
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,079
that looks suspiciously like ours even

92
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,189
if they didn't know the exact location

93
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,780
and even if they didn't have time to

94
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,430
check the tapes as much as I love this

95
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,730
movie

96
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,560
and its first 20 minutes it's maybe the

97
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,969
most Grand Canyon porn film ever made

98
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,859
right outside of those three connected

99
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,329
Brady Bunch episodes at least this

100
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,889
Boulder realizing the movie needed some

101
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,389
action decided to start falling at this

102
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:15,650
very moment to give the astronauts

103
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,239
something to do other than imitate the

104
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,829
Lord of the Rings the hold of you cloud

105
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:22,549
cover tonight a strange luminosity yet

106
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,799
there's no moon how do you know did you

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,540
just land even we're supposed to believe

108
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,190
they've seen nighttime here the movie

109
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,510
shield none of it everything about this

110
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,859
planet is warranty better light a

111
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:31,430
cigarette

112
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,229
also with precious cargo space for this

113
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:34,489
important mission they still send

114
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,349
cigarettes shot to even set up a guy

115
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,000
addicted to cigarettes let alone supply

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
to feed that addiction that way there's

117
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,239
only room for three days of rations they

118
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,099
stop here to smoke and argue and they

119
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,689
somehow all completely avoided the shade

120
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:45,799
of the rock they stopped behind

121
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,930
seriously all these cars are in direct

122
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,849
sunlight right now chase dodge somehow

123
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,079
got a half mile lead during this

124
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,299
conversation line what's immediately

125
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,620
killed the first sign of light that we

126
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,389
see take that stuff yo movie

127
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,919
overestimates my tolerance for watching

128
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,509
people walking glad they made it but

129
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,370
they climbed down these rocks to get

130
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,829
here which is hilarious I mean I'd skip

131
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,090
it too because it's literally impossible

132
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,189
but love the movies optimism how

133
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,479
unobservant do you have to be to not

134
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,650
even be looking for danger

135
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,180
three catalytic aircraft that's easy to

136
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,319
say when you don't realize you're the

137
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,180
crow in this situation yes I know you

138
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,799
hear water but you're on an alien planet

139
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,780
at least in your mind he weirded out by

140
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,620
weird please

141
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,000
the Jerry Goldsmith really do the score

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,490
for this movie guys it gotta be

143
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,720
astronauts also I'm kind of wondering

144
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,979
how the scene would have played out if

145
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,150
their female colleague had lived

146
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,770
beginning to think that is the only

147
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,300
reason she died so that these dudes

148
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,370
could skinny dip in peace also just to

149
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,900
make it men's women and frolicking and

150
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,069
wooing together just two days after

151
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,599
crash landing and having the crew mate

152
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,430
die totally doable right here folks

153
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,949
hello what's happenin here I'm not

154
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,330
judging I just wonder if they have time

155
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,190
for this finally and only for the sake

156
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,750
of propelling the plot these guys see

157
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,919
the natives that have been following

158
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
them for a long time also why do they

159
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,460
steal their clothes it's a summer camp

160
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,199
the planet Jorge is only interested in

161
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,460
who's stealing their stuff to the point

162
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,050
this movie can keep a G rating and keep

163
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,909
us from seeing Charlton Heston also this

164
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,530
movie is rated G another rating system

165
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,879
doesn't come in for a few more months so

166
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,409
this movie was rated afterwards but the

167
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,629
MPA saw this and said general audiences

168
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,699
I want that MPAA back this shot is

169
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,690
brought to you by your local

170
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,340
optometrists looking to make a quick

171
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,050
buck the crew conveniently finds stuff

172
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,340
to cover up their naughty bits all in

173
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,780
one place so this whole movie doesn't

174
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,250
have to be blocked with rocks trees and

175
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,139
comically placed bananas so all that

176
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,550
with the running hiding and stealing

177
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,379
natives was just an elaborate hello the

178
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,300
land when the hell did he get a fruit

179
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,279
and why is he not sharing now the middle

180
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,020
guy has a fruit too but throw and toss -

181
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,669
any fruit - these curse not at least

182
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,409
they haven't tried to fight it you think

183
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,180
you're 2,000 years ahead in time and on

184
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,279
an alien planet and you're going to make

185
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,419
the comment like this instead of

186
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,919
something like holy the aliens on this

187
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,569
planet looks just like we do and look

188
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:44,529
more or less human I think they're mute

189
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,729
you've been watching them for 30 seconds

190
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,800
asshole what a weird thing to say I

191
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,469
shall meet with that one over there the

192
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,580
first reveal of the apes being

193
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,099
accompanied by this music awesome once

194
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,719
in removed why is it cutting down all

195
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,250
the coal the humans are running away

196
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,169
through the core Apes walking slowly and

197
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,460
chopping down on the corn should lead to

198
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,900
the humans escaping though this movie

199
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,129
will claim the opposite this is

200
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,719
extremely inefficient netting doesn't

201
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,800
even wrap around these people by the

202
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,479
time it's done and that just looks like

203
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,860
a minor inconvenience then you have

204
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,509
these assholes who go by two-man teams

205
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,580
to catch one person I mean figure out a

206
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,590
plan guys didn't slaving the human race

207
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,629
for years and this is some cut-rate I'm

208
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,669
an animal psychologist that's all we

209
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,710
have no authority expositional arguing

210
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,699
come on speak come on speak there is no

211
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,289
reason I can think of why after the Apes

212
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,789
took over their planet humans forgot how

213
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,440
to speak again at this point the movie

214
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,240
we don't technically know the desert but

215
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,680
final reveal sure makes

216
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,790
so the movie scene seemed a lot more

217
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,130
stupid doesn't it he keeps pretending he

218
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,259
can call only because he was shot a

219
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,000
throat earlier does his speaking ability

220
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
take a while to manifest you know what

221
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,870
they say human see human do

222
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,699
har-har hilarious but not really

223
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:51,350
hilarious reversing a primate based

224
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,789
idiom is hilarious but not really

225
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:53,360
hilarious

226
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
George tries to grab zeros pen and

227
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,539
notepad in an extremely insane

228
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,250
animal-like way because of course he

229
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,870
does but never wants to zero who

230
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,460
believes humans can act like the Apes do

231
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,139
try to get the pen and notepad to him

232
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,030
anyway even on a whim because I guess

233
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,710
pens and notepads are in scarce supply

234
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,150
in thirty-nine seventy eight and she

235
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,289
probably has a ton of unfinished

236
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,300
tic-tac-toe games written down so would

237
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,919
want to lose those also the standard

238
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,180
prison guard weapon here is apparently

239
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,919
an oversized crutch this guy was

240
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,780
credited as super starving begging arms

241
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,280
guy and he was paid exactly twenty

242
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,870
dollars for his work but he clearly gave

243
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,190
it his all hot ape action jeweled read

244
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,479
something in the sand and while I know

245
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,039
that he can't talk it's absolutely crazy

246
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,750
he can't tap a cage or do something to

247
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,610
get zeros attention during this no the

248
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,530
for no other reason the plot starts to

249
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,330
wipeout what George wrote the Sam just

250
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,500
punishment for fighting in that cage

251
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,180
will be to put you in another cage

252
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,370
that'll teach you thankfully for I guess

253
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,110
the extras budget this jail appears to

254
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,330
be completely empty during this scene

255
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,590
how to make a female ape fall in love

256
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,910
with you in less than two seconds if

257
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,530
you're Charmcaster Oh Wayne Indiana

258
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,539
woohoo shout out to Fort Wayne where I

259
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:58,190
live for five years of my youth go you

260
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,770
Huskies well not Huskies probably IPFW

261
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,120
is Mastodon which admittedly doesn't

262
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,229
roll off the tongue as well but does

263
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,590
better fit the motif of the joke

264
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,940
possibility and yet the science ignorant

265
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,530
ape still somehow took over earth at

266
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,849
some point a century or more after

267
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,479
humans discovered flight come on are we

268
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,470
supposed to believe that these hyper

269
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,849
intelligent Apes haven't figured out

270
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,500
paper airplanes these assholes are

271
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,449
talking about brain surgery but even the

272
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,680
simplest idea of flight never cross

273
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,340
their minds

274
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,050
also this Apes society has learned the

275
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,760
joys of ink pens and paper which also

276
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
suggests they have other modern things

277
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,090
like the paper mill and machinery that

278
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,560
can cut the paper not to mention all the

279
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,300
complexities of producing an ink pen I

280
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,680
know this movie needs a couple things to

281
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,120
get the story going but I'm not giving

282
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,789
you latitude will be set the ape evolved

283
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,270
from a lower order primate possibly man

284
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,740
Louie just thinks it could reverse

285
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,990
everything even evolution this guard

286
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,670
comes in with a leash or some rather

287
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,900
than a lacrosse stick thing that

288
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,470
everybody else uses yeah

289
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,710
he has found peace in heaven jerk eight

290
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,330
nets continue to be insanely bad at

291
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,980
their job and all that in the last

292
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,150
several minutes is now a meaningless

293
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,560
distraction after he gets caught again

294
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,460
thanks for that movie

295
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,260
I enjoy being teased come on seriously

296
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,790
oh wait now he's pretty good

297
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,340
Christ long JC Shyamalan Heston's balls

298
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,380
cam thankfully these Apes have a humans

299
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,940
museum which he fortunately wandered

300
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,920
into our accident also even more

301
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,630
thankfully there are somehow now only

302
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,190
two dudes chasing him instead of

303
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,960
mannequins this movie uses live extras

304
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,880
here to pose as the three cavemen next

305
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,530
to our hero and if Yuri watch their

306
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,180
footage they are hilariously not still

307
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,100
so they made a museum exhibit out of his

308
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,020
fellow crew member that's fine but the

309
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,430
speed at which they did it considering

310
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,870
the crash was just a few days ago it's

311
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,670
astounding anything for a great visual

312
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,310
though I guess this is bad eh I'm sure

313
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,410
but he's also not even aiming at George

314
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,200
he's clearly shooting to the left have

315
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,340
Apes figuring out that they're capturing

316
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,350
tools are yet they seem to all break or

317
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,670
magically spill off a little to no

318
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,410
effort because the filmmakers decided to

319
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,790
shoot this next shot the dramatic way

320
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,050
this is the one that will actually

321
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,200
capture George cages stinking paws off

322
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,230
me you damn dirty ape it looks like

323
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,460
running around like a fool around this

324
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,500
village gave George's voice back or was

325
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
it because he briefly walked through

326
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,110
that church it's a miracle

327
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,610
that being said I'm also removing two

328
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,110
sins for this moment because its iconic

329
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,580
Brown also because Rise of the Planet of

330
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,960
the Apes later perfectly mirrors the

331
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,340
moment with Caesar yelling no at the

332
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,080
primate refuge and I kind of have high

333
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,910
powered fire hoses in this a future but

334
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,050
they don't have central heating they're

335
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,570
stupid apes did I tell you about Stuart

336
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,110
and there was a lovely girl she was to

337
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,200
be the new Eve you see when three male

338
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120
astronauts love one female astronaut

339
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,920
very much a gangbang occurs that

340
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,360
produces children children which will

341
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,770
grow up and eventually incest each other

342
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,540
Nova I taught you about him breeding yep

343
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,250
well let me to slide away what was the

344
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,630
point of all that bull few minutes ago

345
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,340
where they took Nova out of Georgia cell

346
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,660
and put her in a different one and leave

347
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,190
only to come back and take George away

348
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,330
to some sort of tribunal

349
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,340
I'm not prison bars in this scene judge

350
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,350
Dix as the defendants robes are stinky

351
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,000
and immediately is rendered naked with

352
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,230
no thought given to the fact that his

353
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,700
unwashed body might have been driving

354
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,600
the bulk of the stink

355
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,280
guy on trial is allowed to kneel steel

356
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,510
pen and paper and write on a message

357
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,310
without anyone objecting all while the

358
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,600
prosecutor is making his opening

359
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,690
arguments some makes it seems Omari Rosa

360
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,730
knows a great quote from the amazing

361
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,470
George April from his best-selling work

362
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,190
human farm

363
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,170
Helena because a horseshoe ever the

364
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,760
right incision shape for any kind of

365
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,240
surgery

366
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,220
but this the eights now have 20% net

367
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,050
success in this movie we'll practice in

368
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,220
a little luck they could finally get

369
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,110
into race on rondo territory okay guys

370
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,519
let's try to make this see no evil hear

371
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,100
no evil see no evil subtle I mean try

372
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,649
god damnit rot away you did the skater

373
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,439
series my god you made it possible for

374
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,679
us to expose Zira and Cornelius let's

375
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,240
talk about the Apes plan despite the

376
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,379
fact that it's much better for them to

377
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,269
go ahead and kill and lobotomize George

378
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,069
and keep the status quo they'd much

379
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,689
rather stage a whole trial in order to

380
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,279
expose to Apes they suspect don't

381
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,600
believe in their religion considering

382
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,769
the power of the council holds it's

383
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,029
actually amazing they couldn't just

384
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,649
dispose of Zira and Cornelius through

385
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,600
basic lies in general great I just

386
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,949
noticed something and I know it's taken

387
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,480
me a long time to get here but why'd all

388
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,069
the Apes were clothes jury they might

389
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,420
have had some sort of adamantium shame

390
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,189
but they live in a fucking desert and

391
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,720
they're covered in hair wearing jackets

392
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,339
and pants so look at these Apes a

393
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,040
lemonade pronto you just six hours to

394
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,329
make a full conversation

395
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,339
why is six that's a super strange

396
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,779
arbitrary number yield no matter what

397
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,040
else happens in this movie this ape

398
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,619
smoking a stogie is cool as I'll even

399
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,569
take a sit off for Cornelius and I have

400
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:06,269
been indicted for heresy Cornelius and

401
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,649
Zira who are being indicted on the

402
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:09,179
charge of general asshole Larry are

403
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,649
somehow able to walk around freely and

404
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,410
plan prison breaks shaving camp I didn't

405
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,619
realize that man could be monogamous

406
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,819
this sounds like some sort of comment on

407
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,649
human society but what does really mean

408
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,089
in the context of this movie just

409
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,259
because he brought one hot chick with

410
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,389
him doesn't mean monogamous it just

411
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:25,679
means you guys literally paired him with

412
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,029
the hottest woman on the planet and she

413
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,139
was the only one around during the

414
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,029
prison break there is no contradiction

415
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,119
between weight and shyam I probably

416
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,529
should remove us in for this movie

417
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,389
mimicking real life but let's call this

418
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,490
a sin of Honor and add one anyway always

419
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,649
giving orders just like every other

420
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,360
adult that's what this movie really

421
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,879
needed a whiny teen a full minute of

422
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,589
dialogue three climactic Beach cave

423
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,040
exploring

424
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,380
this thousand-year-old donk and somehow

425
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,579
still make noise ah withdraw a pair oh

426
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:56,320
yeah I forgot I only use the voice that

427
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,970
can be heard by people below me I now

428
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,130
need to use my above me voice I know dr.

429
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,570
Zaius told those two Apes to withdraw

430
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,920
but what's really preventing them from

431
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,569
coming back and doing a sneak attack on

432
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,130
these sitting ducks right now oh they

433
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,990
can't convict us of heresy you've helped

434
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,910
prove our innocence are you kidding me

435
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,440
you trust the society to accept your

436
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,110
evidence better follow us I'm pretty

437
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,540
handy with this but still did you fall

438
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,800
for the girl just because of proximity

439
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,899
back in the cages if you were ugly would

440
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,730
we still be seeing the same ending all

441
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,550
my life I have waited you're coming and

442
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,759
drag a geek I guess except that's what

443
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,709
my ex-girlfriend told me when we had sex

444
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,300
about two minutes our build up to a

445
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,649
reveal that would make ray from the

446
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,329
force awakens give up not gonna lie

447
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,339
Statue of Liberty looks pretty good for

448
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,199
2,000 years of wear and tear that's it

449
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm going to remove five sins for one of

450
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,529
the best cinematic reveals ever

451
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:49,790

gotcha one jump ahead of the breadline

457
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,790
one swing ahead of the sword only what I

458
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,689
can afford

459
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:11,949
ladies and gentlemen of the jury I'm

460
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,959

461
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,610
