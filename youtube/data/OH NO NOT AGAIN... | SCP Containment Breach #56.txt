1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,520
Mark: This is SCP Containment Bluhblffffff-

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,920
This is SCP Contunment Brunch. This is SCP Contoonment Branch.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,780
This is... SCP Containment Breach.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,920
The original game that was made a long time ago has finally been updated,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,300
and it started to be updated quite a bit recently.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,620
I-It's come out with regular updates and I think it's because like SCP Unity started like getting popular,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,460
and the remake of that and then the original creators or people like that were like,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,880
(In a silly voice) &quot;Hey, wait a minute! Hey, do-
Do you think that maybe the- the- that- WE did that!&quot;

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
And so like they're finally updating. 
It's still free, which is still shocking to me like...

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,500
You guys should make some money off of this~
It's pretty cool~

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,900
M: But anyway, we're gonna get into it.
We're gonna start right from the beginning.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,820
I'm gonna disable the intro sequence because that's not gonna be any different. My name is Mark.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,780
So! If you're ready, I'm ready. Let's go into this.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,040
[Alarms blare over heavy rumbling.]

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,020
Ahh... *sniffs*
The old familiar sounds, the old familiar smells...

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,360
[Roar in the background]
Woah.. Hi?

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,180
[Alarms and rumbling continue.]

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,460
Hey, look out behind you! I'm gonna save you apparently- Ooh shit...

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,160
(On camera) Guard: Keeps your eyes on it.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,560
M: Oh yeah! I remember this; they added this in...

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,760
Guard: Just keep on watching- (Mark talks over them.)
M: I think I remember this...

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,280
[Lights click off.]
M: Yeah, it's pretty loud!

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,580
[Rumbling grows into a roar.]
Oh shit... Uh oh.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,420
[Mark's footsteps.]
Um, I'm gonna close this. Hang on. Wait, whoa no. I'm gonna close that. [Button beeps.]

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,560
Push the bu- Never mind. I'm not gonna close it.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,780
[Whir of cameras turning.]
[Buttons beep as he presses them.]

27
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,860
Hmm... Oh... Uh oh.
[Buttons beep as he presses them.]

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,920
Door appears to be locked. Okay, is the volume still good?

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
[Two loud buzzes over the PA system.] 
Wow!

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,680
PA: Attention. All personnel report to... (distorted) immediately.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,080
M: Immediately. Immediately, you say?
Oh, I know about immediately.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,740
[Sharp metallic noise.]
Hey! Fuck off with that shit!

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,820
[Distant roar.]
You too!

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm gonna come over there; I'm gonna slap the shit out of you when I find you!

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,980
Present that ass! I will slap.

36
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,100
[Heavy thump.]
I'm a simple man. I see an ass, I slap.

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,000
So, is SCP shooby-dooby down here?

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,560
[Thunder.]
Whoa...

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,380
Oh, that was a lamp. I got scared by a lamp.

40
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,500
[Whir and beep of the camera.]
Hello, are you looking at me? No? Okay.

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,120
So, this is largely gonna be the same.
I didn't read the changelog in depth.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,240
But it did say that there was like new versions of the ending, new bug fixes, new stuff like that...

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,540
Things that could be addressed before... I-
This seems new though, but-

44
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,860
I thought there was something here that I could use it for. So I'm just gonna explore it for a long period of time.

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,900
*inhales* And then, whatever happens, happens.
I don't even know how far we're-

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,240
[Groan of metal shifting.]

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,880
Oh, hey. Wait a minute...

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,780
[Water drips somewhere.]

49
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,020
Hmm... They also did some optimiz-

50
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,820
[Squelching noises.]

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,600
[Something hisses open.]
Is that? Is that *screams* F-fucking forgot about you!

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,000
I-I knew that was-
[Distant screeching.]

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I knew that was gonna be a thing. I knew it. I knew that. I-I was well aware that that was gonna be a thing.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,680
I've seen that before- What.

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,580
Whoa! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Glass shatters somewhere.]

56
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,700
There's a lot more going on here than I remember, or maybe there's not.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
But either way you all need to calm the shit down.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,020
[Low growling]

59
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,360
Whatchu doing over there?
...Okay

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,800
Okay, there's a Tesla gate; I can get through that, but let's see if I need to first.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
[Something falls and crashes in the distance.]

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Oh God, why's my mouse like breaking on me?

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,220
Hello? Oh. Doh, duh- That's not right. I can't. Oh, ugh...

64
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,120
I'm very drunk! I'm extremely high!
I can't look to the right very goodly...

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,420
[Low rumbling]

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:51,400
Let me make sweet love to my mouse. This is how you make sweet love, right?

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,540
Okay, are we better? No something just don't want me looking- looking around very hard.

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,680
[Loud beep] 
Oh.

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,080
[Faint screams in the distance]
I don't know what's happening. I can't move. Oh hey, well never mind then.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:20,740
Wait.. is there like something.. Mouse smoothing.. Can I make that lower? How?

71
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,380
Where's my frame- frame limit?

72
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,390
Nice 60. I don't know. Oh

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,419
Okay, that's a little better now that I limited the frame rate. That is a little better, that is in fact a little better.

74
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,520
Okay, so he's coming that way. Oh

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,360
Never mind. Oh shit, dude. I didn't why did you- I- lady- AH Wait, hang on

76
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,540
Who- stop- Who's talking to me?

77
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,680
Listen

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,200
Alright

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,960
[Sounds of electricity] AGH!

80
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,640
There we go.

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:08,400
Easy enough. Ooh, this is- ahh, hmmm.. I don't remember any of this.

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:19,040
No [man in agony in the background]

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,440
I feel like it's doing a lot more than it was before.

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,360
You know what I mean? I feel like this game is doing considerably more than it was in the previous times that I've experi-

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,080
Oh, shit.

86
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,480
Okay, well I can't go- (Chewbacca noises)

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,000
Chewbacca??

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,120
(Marks Chewbacca impression)

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,200
Alright, I can't go through there without the mask. I don't have the mask yet. I don't know. That don't- That don't sound too good.

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Maybe it's not so bad. But you know, you know how it be with this game

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,360
Hmm..

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Ok so this- [Interrupted by Guard]

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,440
[Unintelligible gibberish]

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,320
(Neck Snapping Crunch) uh oh.

95
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, you's dead. You's guys is dead and I'm not dead- there's the gas mask. Ok, that's what I was looking for, level one card.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's good. I needed that. Um-

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,120
There's documentation here, but I don't think I need it. I've read all the documentation a million times over. Why would I need it again?

98
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,040
Batteries. Take all three, just in case.

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:41,480
Hey, hey, okay. I don't think there's anything down there that I actually need. I'm pretty sure that's the lay of the land. You don't actually need anything there.

100
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,080
Okay.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Level one is-

102
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Oooh

103
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,480
[Girl screams in the background]

104
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,949
I think I remember someone screaming but you know so many people scream in this place.

105
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,710
How can you tell one from another? How could you ever tell one from another?

106
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,570
Okay, I saved. I think this is the Nazi one, if I'm not mistaken.

107
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:08,640
This is the one where a bunch of Nazi stuff happens. So let's go experience that because I feel like it.

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
What about level one?

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,920
Ohhhhhhh

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,400
God damnit

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,960
God heck'n heck is heck, God piece of heck. God damnit.

112
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,880
Alright well let's get out of here.

113
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,570
We'll come back for that. I know how to get cards in this game maybe. I don't know

114
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,080
This is an elevator. I don't want to go down in the elevator because that sounds bad.

115
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,080
So I'm not gonna go unless I have to.

116
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,600
Okay, that's open.

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
Anyone there? Okay.

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,420
We'll close that for now. I'm gonna try to go through this area over here. There's a few la- Okay.

119
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,100
That's a checkpoint lockdown, can't go there. But that's where we need to go for the next area.

120
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,160
I do have the gas-

121
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
Where does that lead to?

122
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,320
Why is there just a door- no- what?

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,080
What the?

124
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,040
I've never seen a layout like that before.

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,520
Have I?

126
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,620
Oh- uh- wai- wha wha wha..

127
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,080
What is this shit?

128
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
(Repeats) What is this shit?

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,020
What is this shit? I've never seen this shit before!

130
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,660
This is new!

131
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,060
This is new.

132
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,360
Ah, report all potential anomalies. Hehe, it looks like a deer shooting out of a recycling bin. A little weird, huh?

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,600
Okay, what the fff is this all about?

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, just some weird checkpoint? Uh, don't forget today is pizza day.

135
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,360
P-P-P-Pizza day.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,280
Oh shit. What is this?

137
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,860
Uh, okay. Alright you know what? Imma leave that for now.

138
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,240
Just gonna leave that for now.

139
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Let's see If I can go through here. It is open.

140
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,960
What do I need for this one?

141
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,060
Oh, It worked! That-

142
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,360
I didn't expect that to actually work. What is this?

143
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,990
I've never- Oh, sh- Oh you let me close it behind me, just in case

144
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,320
I think I just picked up a clipboard for some reason.

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,500
Right, I might as well put everything in the clipboard.

146
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh. No, put it in the clipboard.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, put the clipboard there. There we go. Okay, pick up the map. Alright, cool.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,060
Now put a battery in the map. Okay, cool

[Low rumbling]

150
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,640
Alright, anyway.

151
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,500
Some kind of storage room, that's awfully nice of them. Now I can have this. Oh, I can finally get a-

152
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,380
A radio again, which I haven't been- Ah, I'm not trying to look at it, I'm trying to drag it. Whatever that was,

153
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,640
I probably knew about it.

154
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,910
God, I'm trying to drag these things. Fuck you.

155
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,160
No. There- NO!

156
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,360
There, you there. Okay, now-

157

(Blaring Alarms start)

158
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,960
Uh huh.

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,460
Yeah, uh huh.

160
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:13,400
[Catchy music from the communication device] [Mark snaps along with the tune]

[Marks starts singing]

162
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,590
Okay, that- Well that was boring. Glad I did that- ooh, that is that's an SCP, isn't it?

163
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,560
Isn't it- isn't this actually an SCP? I can't reme- Well it's gone now apparently

164
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,640
There's something about this origami. That's actually an SCP. I can't- I can't remember. Ah, whatever. Okay, I don't need another card.

165
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,060
Well, I do need another card in case I mess up this one. I'll take the extra battery and I've already got a clipboard.

166
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:49,820
So just in case I mess this up, I'm gonna keep- I'm gonna hold on to that.

167
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,960
Oh woah, woah, woah. What did I see in front of me?

168
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,380
Oh hey.

Death by ear.

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,980
Welp..

173
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,480
Shit, that doesn't sound good. Also, I'm all the way over here now so dick me. Dick me right in the bunghole.

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,100
Alright, we gotta go back. I've never- I've never actually died by that little bear before.

175
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:43,360
Fascinating death, I- I- I suppose. The way that one works, if I recall correctly- the way that one works is it lets out a loud shriek

176
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,450
and then your body just starts growing ears all over the skin.

177
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,560
Everywhere inside, like, every surface area in- inside and outside of your body starts growing skins.

178
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,990
So, like, your throat starts growing ears.

179
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,910
Like your- your- your-

180
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,560
Everything. Your ears start growing ears, like, you just start growing ears. It's not, it's not chill.

181
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,320
It ain't cool. It, uh, It's pretty much the opposite of chill and/or cool.

182
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,520
So, yeah. Now I gotta save before I die horribly to ears. I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna save at the, uh..

Nobody here. Gonna close it.

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:35,420
Always close the doors behind you or else you get snuck up on by..

187

Da big Billy..

Remember that..

Da, da. Dadadadada.

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,960
Okay moving on. There's another way to go besides the ear route. Oh, but I do have the gas mask.

191
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,869
Let me go- let me go down here first because I bet this is gonna be more of a-

[Character breathes heavily]

Are you sure about that?

194

Hmm... Mmm, okay. Alright. Okay

Hey, wait a minute. I know this is a trap. I know a trap when I see one.

199

Yep, there's the trap. I said- [Door closes] oh, shit! Ah, shit! Shit!

Hey wait! Shit!

Lada dee, la la de de- there was something on this table here.

202
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,070
That's a level two. I want to drop that and then pick up that one.

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:30,400
Shit, fucking save. Oh shit! I can save at that. Okay. I don't know..

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,100
Is there something in that room?

Oh, do-ing. I can never remember if it actually is not.

214

Doesn't look like it is but hey, we saved so what's the worst that could happen? I die a horrible death.

Hey, buddy!

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,480
Alright, so I've got- I've got a level two.

224
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,600
Alright, so I'm-

225
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,960
Is there always blood here? I can't remember. Probably. So I'm gonna lock myself in here.

226
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,620
Alright, whatever. Can't carry any more items. Well, that's okay, cause I don't know why I have two of these.

227
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,660
But I'm gonna drop one in. Now, for the map, I'm gonna try Fine.

228
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm gonna drop it in here and try to make it a Fine one.

229
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,480
There's very few things that you need for Very Fine, as I remember.

[Machine makes loud noises]

What did we get? What did we get? I think we got the ultimate version. OS 310?

Oh!

234
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,360
Is that the ultimate? I think that's the ultimate.

235
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,160
What happens- okay. Let me- let me put- since I have a spare, let me put this one in on Ultra Fine.

236
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,660
Just in-

237
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:38,900
[A loud scream from somewhere as Mark is jumpscared]

238
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,580
We'll put this one in on Ultra Fine and then..

239
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't know if that's the correct answer but you know, it's the only answer I've got. So whatever. Oh, there's test logs.

240
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:01,160
Put one chimp on Fine. Okay, it made something. I can't carry any more of this. Let me put that on a clipboard. Okay.

241
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,040
Ah-ha! That's the ultimate! Yeah- Uh oh.

242
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,540
Uh oh.

243
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Well that don't- that don't look good.

244
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,620
But anyway, I've got this so I don't need that anymore. The only problem is I don't have a save point in here..

245
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,040
So I can't exactly, uh..

246
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:23,660
Make- take too many risks, but I've got one of these. I'm gonna try to- I'm gonna try to put this to Omni.

247
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,440
Fuck, was it Fine or Very Fine? Right, so they've changed up how this works. Good thing I looked at this..

248
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,160
Otherwise, I would have been doing this forever

249
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,100
You can get it up to a level 3 card.

250
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,120
By putting a level 2 in there and going to Fine. If you go to level 2 and you crunch it on Fine...

251
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,250
It has a chance to go to level 3.

252
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,740
But then level 3 is gonna be the max that I can get.

253
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,480
Once I get to level 4 I can- may turn a level 4 into a level 5...

254
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,400
And then I can turn a level 5 into Omni.

255
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,060
Oh, shit.

256
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,620
I have a chance to turn a level 5 into an Omni, but this is my level 3, so that's good.

257
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,700
I'm gonna create two level 3's.

258
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,360
I don't need two level 3's.

259
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,419
[Ominous sound erupts] Whoa.

260
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:10,309
Why would I need two level 3's, right? I'm gonna leave this here then, 'cause I'm pretty sure this is good...

261
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:11,390
For now.

262
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,380
There's also the gas mask and then the only other thing is the radio, but I don't know if the radio can turn into anything.

263
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,460
I honestly have no idea.

264
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:19,970
Okay.

265
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,620
So I've got the gas mask. This- you can breathe easier.

266
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:31,320
So it gives unlimited stamina so I can just run forever and ever and ever and ever with this so that's good. Let's go out.

267
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,520
Got a card.

268
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,640
That opened. Blink, blonk.

269
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,250
Where you at buddy? Are you here? Better not be here.

270
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,160
Okay, you're not here. Okay.

271
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,140
There's a screen right here where I can just quickly save.

272
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,340
Moving on, got it.

273
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:57,440
Hmm, that's not fun with the whole not being able to save all the time kind of thing. And apparently...

274
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,800
I can keep this open..

275
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,680
And try to, like, listen out for anything important.

276
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,860
Hello? Whoa, that's (starts to stutter)

Uh, (gibberish) Umble, umble. Uh, mmm.

278
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,440
MMmmm. What is that? What is that?

279
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,120
Oh.

280
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Emily Ross is- Who the- Who the hell is Emily Ross?

281
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,320
Why is this a thing? Huh? Why do I just get this?

Okay, weird. (Turns off the radio)

288

Okay, I guess this doesn't do anything, does it? Oh, level four or higher. Damn.

289
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,460
Got this one open though. What was this one again? Woah, shit. Oh, fuck

290
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:17,160
What was this one again? Oh, this is the gas mask! I don't know if I want this.

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,780
Well, shit my dick! Okay, here we go! Oh wait. No. I know how to get rid of it. I know.

296
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,960
Wait, if I take him through the Tesla gate- if I- if he follows me through the Tesla gate..

297
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,820
Then I will be in good old-fashioned businesses.

298
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Okay, wait. Hang on. Wait.

299
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,960
[The monster and Mark screams]

300
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:55,040
Why were you so fast!? You're not that fast!

301
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:04,660
I didn't want to go in the pocket dimension. That was so fast. Why is it so fast?

302
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,480
He got faster.

303
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,130
Alright.

304
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:21,940
Well, I guess I'm- because of that save that I just did, I guess I'm stuck traversing the pocket dimension until I get through this.

305
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,180
Okay, so down one of these I think if I remember correctly, it's like you go down..

306
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,140
Oh..

307
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,839
It's so topsy-turvy and you look kind of a little far..

308
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:39,220
You look down it a bit, but I don't know how far. It's like SCP- that stairwell game- Oh God..

309
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,600
Wait.

310
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,940
Wha!? What the fuck was that?

311
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,460
You didn't say that was gonna be a thing. No, there's nothing down there.

312
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,440
What the fuck was that?

313
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,780
Someone gonna give me a little smooch? A little poochy-smooch? A little smooch doochy.

314
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,220
One of these, has like..

315
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,460
But I don't remember which. I don't remember what the identification is for this.

316
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,240
Oh... That doesn't sound good.

317
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,640
Oh! Why? Why was that a thing?

318
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:24,800
Okay. Oh, there's a note. Okay, wait. Hold on.

319
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:33,880
Well, we got that. The paper clip is not strong enough to hold any more items. Well, you know..

320
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,780
[Game makes an ominous noise]

321
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:42,140
Shit, okay. I'm just gonna go. Ah, shit. Ah, shit. Ah, shit! No, no! I got the note! I got the note!

322
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:52,760
Woah, what the fuck.

323
00:22:52,760 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh.

324
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,940
Ooooooh,

325
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,300
WHY?

326
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,800
Why are you asshole?  You're such a douche! You're such a douche, just leave me alone! I haven't saved.

327
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,360
Oh God, where am I?! No, not this way! No, no please. Don't kill me. No! You're so fast! Oh, you're so fast..

328
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,800
and you're so strong. Oh, he's so strong. He's so strong and so fast.

329
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,300
You got a lot faster. You got a lot stronger. I don't know where I am. I don't know what I'm doing!

330
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,060
I don't want it! I don't want it! Please no! Ah, God! Not again!

331
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,040
Please, I don't want anything. Please, I don't want anything for Christmas!

332
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,540
Where am I?!

333
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:43,280
No! Nooooooo!

334
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,880
Sucks to suck, don't it?

335
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,560
We're gonna- It's gonna be- We're gonna load in here and it's gonna immediate-

336
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,200
Wait, oooohhh!

337
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,500
Peek-a-boo!

338
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,860
Peek-a-boo!

339
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,380
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo, I see you. I see- I didn't press the button! I didn't press-

340
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,020
I DIDN'T PRESS- [Mark is interrupted by the monster]

341
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,320
Fuckin, why did I get an achievement?

342
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,360
Aaaahhhh... Fuckin' shit ticks..

343
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,540
Take off the gas mask.

344
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,940
Ooohhh, why? Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.

345
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,620
So I gotta find the note. Where's the note? It was right at front, last time.

346
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,200
I could see better when I had- no I couldn't.

347
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,880
God, it's super wonky. There's the note. Okay, there's the note and- uh, shit.

348
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,970
There we go. There's that and off we go.

349
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:45,169
Dicks, dicks, dicks, dicks. Oh, what? Noooo. I don't wanna go through this again.

350
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:51,960
Hello, Pendulum.

351
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,640
Oh, boy. I hate this.

352
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,800
Oh, no. Nya, no, no, no, no, no...

353
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,460
Here it comes. Uh, I'm gonna go for it...

354
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,340
I'm not gonna make it!

355
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,340
I'm so slow! I'm not gonna make it!

356
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,980
Oh, God!

357
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,240
Stop.

358
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,340
[Let's out a breath of relief] Okay.. Alright...

359
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:26,940
I'm not gonna- Oh, I didn't know that was there! [Sound of character hitting the ground] AH! My bad! My bad! My bad. My bad.. My bad...

360
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,820
Oh, fucking- I forgot!

361
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,380
Hi, hello.

362
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,190
So, I think...

363
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,289
I think what the deal-io is..

364
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,500
Once I get the note, which is here..

365
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,080
Once I get the note..

366
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,060
Just, I just gotta, like- I don't know, man. Wait?

367
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,160
Read the note? Maybe I gotta read it. I don't know, I actually read it that time.

368
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,440
Put it on my clipboard and then wait for like, Larry, to come...

369
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,600
Find me, 'cause he was coming and then I got out and I don't know why, but...

370
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,049
I was just gonna wait for a bit. Y'know, just rest my legs...

371
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:14,140
Yeah, I'll need this note eventually, but I doubt I'm gonna get to the point where I'll even need this. But it's like.. Its..

372
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,990
It's just..

373
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,870
Ugh...

374
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,890
Seven, four, one, four. Got it. Blink.

375
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,820
Uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh...

376
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:31,320
I thought Larry would have shown up by now. Do I have to go on the big swinging balls?

377
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:40,270
Oh! Oh, shit. Well, please, Larry. Don't come back then. Why is that- It was just darkness!

378
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,400
What was that? What did I- I didn't see anything! It was blackness!

379
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,620
This is a void. It's just a void

380
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:56,100
It doesn't go nowhere!

381
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,920
What- I- What- I- Nooooo!

382
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,140
Wait a minute!

383
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,780
Wait, blood..?

384
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,480
Is that my blood?

385
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,140
Is that- am I bleeding? I'm bleeding, aren't I? Why am I bleeding?

386
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,500
I'll just jump. Okay, here we go. Weeee- Oh, God!

387
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,700
Oh, shit!

388
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,320
Oh.

389
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,500
Oh, G- Oh, shit.

390
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,840
Um..

391
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,040
I guess I didn't leave then.

392
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,240
Ah..

393
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,080
Ah, shitty tits.

394
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,280
What the fuck?

395
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,560
What the fuck??

396
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,440
Uh...

397
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay..

398
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,640
It's real topsy-turvy here.

399
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
Oh.

400
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,560
There's nothing in here. I vaguely remember this, but I didn-

401
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,500
Ooo.

402
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,580
Of all the places that they had to revamp and make new and fun, why this place?

403
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,840
Why give Larry anything?

404
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,160
Why give Larry anything at all?

405
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Oh, what is this? Oh, what is this? Oh, what is this?

406
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,040
Oh...

407
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:25,360
There's a whole lotta nothing maybe? That's a big pillar. Not sure what the point of the pillar is.

408
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,720
Oh.

409
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,480
Oh, ah.

410
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,480
[Loud sound echoes throughout the room] Uhh! Why did you do that?

411
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,680
What was that about?

412
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,080
What was that about?

413
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
[Major stuttering]

414
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm bleeding.

415
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,480
Ahhh!

416
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,040
K- Keel? Kill?

417
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,480
I'll kill, did I kill? Where am I? Did I kill? I think I killed.

418
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,160
Oh, shit. I'm in a tomb.

419
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,340
OH, OH, OH, AHH!

420
00:28:52,340 --> 00:29:08,720
HI! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

421
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,880
Of all the time..

422
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,000
Of all the time...

423
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,720
Have somebody in this- Oh, hello again.

424
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:29,020
Ohhh, boy. That's probably not good. Yeah, I know I'm losing blood. How do you expect me to solve it?

425
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,700
Ohhh, boy..

426
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,140
Well, I'm gonna die here, that's for sure.

427
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,720
That's for damn sure. I'm definitely gonna die.

428
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,960
On this- it's just a matter of tummy. Okay, you can't see me Mr. Big Eye in Sky.

429
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,460
Uh oh.

430
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,360
Oh...

431
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,460
Alright, Mr. Big Eye. Alright. Uh oh.

432
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,620
Uh oh.

433
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,720
I think this is where I just die straight up.

434
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,240
Oh. Well, I think they see me.

435
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,040
Oh, shit. Look away. I can't look away. I can't-

436
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,800
Shit.

437
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,220
Oh, that's so weird. Ah, there I'm dead.

438
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,240
No man's land.

439
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,460
(Talk under his breath) Fuck..

440
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,760
(Under his breath) What the fuck..

441
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,440
That was something else.

442
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,620
La-dee-da! Could not do nothing. Couldn't do nothing.

443
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,300
Alright, so we're gonna leave that there.

444
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,299
I don't have enough time to dive too much deeper

445
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:40,160
but I can't believe that I just loaded up the game and saw a ton of new shit.

446
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,080
That is pretty impressive. I haven't done that in a long time

447
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,660
With this game. I haven't just been able to go like,

448
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,860
&quot;I will load up the game! Let's see what happens! And then duddly-duddly-doo!&quot;

449
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,000
But for this one, thanks for watching.

450
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And as always I see you in the next video. Buh-bye
