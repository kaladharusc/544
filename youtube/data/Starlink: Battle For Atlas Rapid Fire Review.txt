00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,710
hey everyone how's it going del Ruth

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,600
here bringing you another rapid-fire

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,880
style review this time for StarLink

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,890
battle for Atlas StarLink is an

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,869
action-adventure space sandbox game

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,449
developed by Ubisoft Toronto starlings

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,310
story is very easy to follow you're a

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,260
part of a super diverse team known as

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,540
StarLink venturing into the Atlas solar

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,610
system and plunged into a war with an

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,710
enemy known as the Legion that you

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,510
didn't ask for because the main villain

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,730
is just honestly kind of an asshole your

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,440
job and purpose becomes to build up a

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,149
resistance take back planets and

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,579
eventually kill the evil bad guy let me

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,289
say straight off I was told to go into

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,090
this game putting my adult thinking to

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,530
the side and try to see this for what it

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,500
is a game geared at a younger audience

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,699
this means that I wouldn't cringe too

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,260
hard at jokes geared for younger people

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,149
and I try to see it from perspective a

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,100
teenager would during my playthrough I

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,600
was told that this would curb a lot of

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,100
the issues that adult me would see

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,320
through my play but unfortunately that

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,810
was not entirely the case before I start

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,040
tearing into the issues with the game

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,420
I'm going to give it credit for what it

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,549
does were bright graphically StarLink is

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,530
salted and looks fantastic at least on

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,810
the ps4 Pro and I didn't disappoint me

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,009
in the slightest being only on the

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,080
consoles every planet of the 7 was

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
completely unique vibrant and had great

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,979
design I enjoyed exploring them and

39
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,030
never really got bored with the

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,229
environments as I played through the

41
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,420
game weapon effects and explosion

42
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,979
effects were also great all the

43
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,360
different elements and explosion types

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,159
being represented well in a visual

45
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,079
aspect voice acting throughout is done

46
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,939
well the characters lines are obviously

47
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,409
geared towards younger people and I'm

48
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,549
entirely alright with that

49
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,560
they all had solid personalities and I

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,329
didn't find any single character be too

51
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,860
over-the-top or out of place for the

52
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,040
universe they set up I'll go find help

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,450
careful

54
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,850
I'll tell you one thing that's out there

55
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:06,300
a bunch of killer robots killer robots

56
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,470
affect all audio in the game and

57
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,750
generals spot on everything gave good

58
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,610
feedback especially enemy deaths and

59
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,500
overawed say it was definitely a strong

60
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,270
point of StarLink and all technical

61
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,280
aspects to the game performs great I was

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,630
getting decent FPS throughout my

63
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,100
experience and I never once had any

64
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,380
glitches crashes or save corruptions of

65
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,630
any sort never encountered a single bug

66
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,940
at all and in this day and age that's

67
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,320
especially rare considering it's an

68
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,120
ubisoft title there weren't even any

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,130
animation glitches to speak of which was

70
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,080
absolutely mind-blowing there's also a

71
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,330
local only co-op which is a nice feature

72
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,190
that's normally not in games these days

73
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,990
and I could totally appreciate that

74
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,640
that's pretty much all the praise I

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,870
could give the game everything else in

76
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,220
my opinion either fell into the

77
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,380
extremely average category or even below

78
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,660
average in some situations and the real

79
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,610
situation with StarLink is that outside

80
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,740
the visuals it feels incredibly

81
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,870
simplistic and shallow you equip the

82
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,160
ship with about a dozen or so different

83
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,720
weapons that you get through either

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,519
buying the digital deluxe edition for 80

85
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,019
dollars which gives you everything

86
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,989
buying toys or getting them extremely

87
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,269
slowly in-game each of these weapons

88
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,830
with various elements that are strong

89
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,390
against enemies of the opposite type

90
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,340
this rock-paper-scissors mentality

91
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,050
persists throughout and really is the

92
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,060
only tactic you'll ever consistently use

93
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,190
space combat also suffers from the same

94
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,200
lack of depth ships can be swapped out

95
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,970
with each ship having sort of a focus

96
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,459
like maneuverability tanking or utility

97
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:25,989
but that never really feels like a

98
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,180
mandatory mechanic I think through most

99
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,800
of the game I stuck with the same 1 or 2

100
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,750
ships only swapping to the others when I

101
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,790
died multiple times in a row both ships

102
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,410
and weapons can also be modded these

103
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,300
mods doing very simplistic things like

104
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,000
increasing fire a damage etc and these

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,260
mods are and through killing bad guys

106
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,239
and completing tasks found on every

107
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,190
planet weapons it ships will be need to

108
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,870
be leveled up to through use to get

109
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,489
skill points to put into your pilots

110
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,230
allowing them to specialize in certain

111
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,480
roles and give generic bonuses to every

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,549
other pilot in your arsenal each pilot

113
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,290
can re level ships and weapons you've

114
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,030
already leveled on other pilots so at

115
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,870
least you don't have to worry about

116
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,250
running out of skill points are being

117
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,840
forced into using weapons you haven't

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
used already the toys themselves seem

119
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
completely an utter

120
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,680
pointless and honestly kind of a

121
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,480
detriment to the enjoy ability of the

122
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,519
game if you use them the swapping

123
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,769
mechanic feels clunky as is and I can

124
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,599
only imagine that having multiple ships

125
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,150
toys pilots and weapons would compound

126
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,949
the issue to insane degrees if you

127
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,419
weren't using them while you tried to

128
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,460
play Starling plus if you don't buy the

129
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,050
digital pack to get everything in the

130
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,610
game you're going to be spending upwards

131
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,440
of a hundred and fifty dollars on

132
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,060
physical toys just to get the equipment

133
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,250
and that's not something I'll ever see

134
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,199
as an option I guess the best way to put

135
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,000
it is that StarLink feels designed

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,010
around making you either buy toys or buy

137
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,960
everything digitally progression of

138
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,669
unlocking ships and weapons normally

139
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,289
throughout missions is incredibly slow

140
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,630
leaving you for large chunks of Starlite

141
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,310
with a handful of weapons and fighting

142
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,660
in situations where you don't have the

143
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,580
correct element I personally don't think

144
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,050
I would have been able to tolerate going

145
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,160
through the game without having

146
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,630
everything at the start and that's a

147
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,580
major issue I would not buy the toys

148
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,949
period it feels dated and rather poorly

149
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,870
thought-out as far as progression the

150
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,110
entire design of the system just feels

151
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,550
super greedy and I don't like it in the

152
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,350
slightest you know yeah as a side note

153
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,150
if you do have a physical toys they

154
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,010
don't store any data on them so if you

155
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,240
go play at a friend's house for the

156
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,220
local co-op or anything all your

157
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,750
progress and perks and everything are

158
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,699
left at the system at home mission

159
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,169
structure and general gameplay is

160
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,630
extremely repetitive and startling every

161
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,190
mission can be summarized down to go

162
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,820
here fetch this go here scan this or go

163
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,099
here and kill bad guys there's no real

164
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,889
twist or complexity to it every outposts

165
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,210
are building you rescue will have you

166
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,160
doing the same things and this persists

167
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,020
through all seven planets in the game's

168
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,150
galaxy it really doesn't complement the

169
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,680
unique biome of each planet it

170
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,240
eventually starts to feel like an utter

171
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,190
chore as you play travelling between

172
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,840
planets initially sucks with the

173
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,610
controls feeling really clunky in space

174
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,409
and there being constant slowdowns with

175
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,000
pirates and the Legion attempting to

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
pull you out of hyperspace when you're

177
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,490
just trying to mind your own damn

178
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,410
business

179
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:01,180
[Music]

180
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,340
personally I tried my best to avoid ever

181
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,690
going into space past the initial

182
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,030
requirements as fast travel thankfully

183
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,460
existed and allowed me to avoid it space

184
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,650
combat definitely isn't a strong point

185
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,390
in Starling and if you're expecting a

186
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,250
tense an elaborate space gameplay you're

187
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,590
going to be sorely disappointed there's

188
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,660
also a distinct lack of enemy types in

189
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,320
Starling

190
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,270
most enemies are either smaller bigger

191
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,890
versions of themselves with elements

192
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,540
added and never really develop into

193
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,060
anything complex beyond that boss is as

194
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,070
well are extremely underwhelming I think

195
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,720
in total there are only three actual

196
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,060
bosses with one of them being a ship

197
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,160
gauntlet so it doesn't count and aside

198
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,720
from the final boss they're pretty much

199
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,300
the same throughout the entire place

200
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:58,819
[Music]

201
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,340
wow what a boss shoot a weak spot damage

202
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,530
boss boss does next phase shoot weak

203
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,539
spot so on and so forth with little to

204
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,729
no deviation in that design hell they're

205
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,229
not even the slightest bit difficult

206
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,759
from what I experience the final boss

207
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,560
actually dying in less than a minute in

208
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,590
his final form literally being one-shot

209
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,080
by me and finally one of the worst

210
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,750
problems this story in total mission

211
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,199
wise only lasted about two hours what I

212
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,000
mean by this is that unique game playing

213
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,919
missions you know scripted missions only

214
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,960
amounted to about two hours including

215
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,210
cutscenes there's almost nothing here

216
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,370
it's better than no man's sky don't get

217
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,960
me wrong but outside of that it's almost

218
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,979
non-existent

219
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,810
it's just rinse and repeat tasks that

220
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,979
you've already been doing throughout

221
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,449
your entire playthrough of StarLink

222
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,099
without any major development of plot

223
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,930
character arcs or anything such like

224
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,349
that

225
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,449
leading to a massive letdown final

226
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,009
series of events and then an endgame

227
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,479
mode where you do what you were doing

228
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,789
before but indefinitely I'll find them

229
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,099
thanks I probably shouldn't have put a

230
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,990
trainee on active field duty but they're

231
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:04,120
brave though

232
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm just an errand boy

233
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,260
what do I know I guess if I had any

234
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,970
suggestions for how the sequel to

235
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,860
StarLink if there is one could be

236
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,390
improved upon it we try to make the

237
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,370
shallow puddle of game mechanics that

238
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,770
are starlings core issues at least about

239
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,780
as deep as a link everything just feels

240
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,090
so simple so average and honestly at

241
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,860
times underwhelming it's carried

242
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,810
entirely by the vibrant colors visuals

243
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,430
and I guess even relief that it's not as

244
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,169
bad as no man's sky was it launched to

245
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,030
me it may not have much but he'll at

246
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,919
least it has a story an actual

247
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,110
personality behind it with everything in

248
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,820
mind I'm going to end up at a 5 out of

249
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,310
10 an incredibly average rating there's

250
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,140
no better way to describe starlings than

251
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,420
me it's not a great game but it's not

252
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,910
awful and that's just how it is I would

253
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,960
have liked to give it a 6 with the

254
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,270
entire toy mentality and near forcing of

255
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,220
people to buy the $80.00 digital version

256
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,840
really drove it down it was just too

257
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,160
little here to be sold in the first

258
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,900
place and it really stands out in the

259
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,180
case of Starling anyway that's gonna be

260
