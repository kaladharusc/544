1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,890
all right so here's the truth the

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,740
fatigue of like just being alive is

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,540
really starting to set in every

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,000
Wednesday before Thanksgiving I post a

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,099
video I have four years and then I

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,440
stress wake up on Thursday and cook all

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,940
day for Thanksgiving which is like

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,220
honestly stupid like what am i doing you

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,770
know we have dietary restrictions we're

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,480
both vegan Julianne celiac can't eat

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,760
gluten so like it's a lot to expect

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,189
anyone to ever cook anything for us you

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,990
know so usually we're the ones bringing

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,090
our own food to wherever we're going or

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,890
eating it here whatever we basically

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,620
stress cook every Thanksgiving on the

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,260
day and I'm like you know what not this

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,559
year I'm not I'm not because I'm

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,320
fatigued from being alive from a 32nd

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,660
year it's a lot ladies being alive am i

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,149
right so I know that Julian has posted

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,950
many vlogs of us cooking for

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,300
Thanksgiving on his channel in the past

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,120
but like I I'm I literally just want to

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,530
cook today and I want to feel like a

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,780
normal person and like relax and have a

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,430
good time and just sort of show you guys

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,809
what we're making for Thanksgiving

29
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,239
because ah I genuinely appreciate that

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,860
you guys treat me like a person and then

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,720
I'm just like want to make Thanksgiving

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,580
dinner and if you're not American and

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,710
you don't care let just watch us cook

34
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,360
something yeah I think it'd be really

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,430
nice to not wake up at the crack of dawn

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,680
tomorrow and stress cook just because

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,600
cuz then don't even enjoy Thanksgiving

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,340
you're just exhausted he was just like

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,500
sweating in the kitchen sweating all day

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,780
I will warn you ahead of time we're not

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,909
making like any vegetable warning we're

42
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,860
not making any vegetables because I'm

43
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,229
pretty sure any vegan can throw down

44
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,900
some dank green beans but I did not save

45
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,939
all my calories so I could eat some

46
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,799
green beans on Thanksgiving forget about

47
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,350
it we healthy all the time it's about

48
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,170
carbs okay we're cooking only the

49
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,450
necessary stuff which is carbs and carbs

50
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,009
and carbs of carbs and more carbs carbs

51
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,899
giving so you just made the food pyramid

52
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,299
I did I'm hopeful so I think we're gonna

53
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,100
start with dessert we're making a

54
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,110
beautiful apple crisp because we have

55
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,659
made vegan gluten-free pies in the past

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,399
and honestly it's so much work for such

57
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,960
a mediocre product it's not even worth

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,210
it so just skip to the apple crisp and

59
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,560
give me something good that's way easier

60
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,939
stell million right why are you taking

61
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,319
the sick result we're not gonna eat the

62
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,140
state's good I like you that's so miss

63
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,250
you don't have to log your food if you

64
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,780
make the barcode prove it spit it out I

65
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,819
see them a new tongue

66
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,830
alright so we're gonna be cooking two

67
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,470
pounds of great smith apples it's like

68
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,269
peeling right you have to peel all of

69
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,220
them and cut all of them I'm getting the

70
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,170
other stickers I love you so much but

71
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,209
it's not about you to save you all the

72
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,980
boredom of watching us cutting and

73
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,080
peeling apples which is riveting I'm

74
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,760
just gonna go ahead and do that right

75
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,239
now

76
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,489
be right back trying to make an assembly

77
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,930
line I'd say the only thing worse than

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,569
healing apples is peeling all those

79
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,519
potatoes I remember last year it was

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,799
like I've never given another day don't

81
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,959
look good we need a ton of potatoes

82
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,459
last time well because we made them for

83
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,610
like ten people we cut our apples we're

84
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,380
just gonna make the topping really quick

85
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,799
so or my celiac friends we got some

86
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,930
gluten-free flour how much is that it's

87
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,830
1.5 cups times 1.5 ok you can do the

88
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,769
math go ahead and put that in here cuz

89
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,690
we're making extra topping right cuz I

90
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,609
think we use some extra apples since

91
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,920
we're like 1.5 in the recipe which I'll

92
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,989
link in the description 1 cup of rolled

93
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,970
oats and then three quarters of a cup of

94
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,609
each sugar and light brown sugar Earth

95
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,530
Balance started making like nice little

96
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,019
things like this Rhianna v jammer spoon

97
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,910
into that container over and over again

98
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,769
which is what I usually do all my other

99
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,660
grown ladies out there when you tire

100
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,250
then you just want to enjoy your food

101
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,260
but like you've got so much cooking and

102
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,239
working to doing you tie it listen I'm

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,700
not complaining okay I know you guys all

104
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,470
have jobs in lives and it's hard

105
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,269
sometimes to just cook things because

106
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,889
you just want it to be cooked to you

107
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,100
Nina it says mash so let's try it their

108
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,989
way and if I hate it I'll do it my way

109
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,260
oh no it's going everywhere

110
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,739
I mean Thanksgiving this in a situation

111
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,190
like this

112
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,510
I think bigger hands are better but

113
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,569
careful hands are also really good oh we

114
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,010
can do it we can make it if you let me

115
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,950
do everything beautiful we gotta bring

116
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,480
this sugar up from the bottom yeah I

117
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,030
love spending time with family oh let me

118
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,850
just get flow control first this is a

119
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,470
good stuff I don't have a lot of

120
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,419
experience making pies I literally make

121
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,460
up high once a year for the big skinny

122
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,560
and to make a gluten free and vegan pie

123
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,030
crust let's make it like a cheesecake

124
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,979
where it's like nuts and you know dates

125
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,960
or whatever that's super easy but like

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,410
you know

127
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,919
Abdo e pastry pie crust it's like hard

128
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,080
it takes a little practice and I usually

129
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,940
end up burning it a little bit where it

130
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,310
just crumbles everywhere it's just like

131
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,139
sort of on the apples anyways I feel

132
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,940
like apple crisp is just like the best

133
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,310
of both worlds and is so much easier and

134
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,590
it's like messy already so you can

135
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,870
reheat it and just like a gloopy pile

136
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,970
instead of trying to worry about getting

137
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,310
perfect little pie slices which is a

138
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,110
pipe dream all right so our topping is

139
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,020
done we're going to cover the apples and

140
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,849
I think this recipe calls for our orange

141
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,650
juice which is why I picked this one you

142
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,229
wanna get the apples ready yeah get

143
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,400
ready get ready so we need 1/2 a cup of

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,850
orange juice

145
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,320
I already put everything in the mixture

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
so a tablespoon and a half of cinnamon

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,240
this is a trick that I learned from food

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,540
wishes forever ago he says if you can

149
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,850
you should always greet your own fresh

150
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,800
nutmeg so it actually makes a big

151
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,729
difference that's all good

152
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,010
love me some fresh nutmeg a teaspoon and

153
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,350
a half we didn't slice them like

154
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,240
SuperDuper thin but I feel like that's

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,340
thin enough right like what am I gonna

156
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,320
do spend seven hours slicing apples

157
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,330
super thin like who cares it's gonna go

158
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,090
on your mouth that's a bite size for me

159
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,070
that's like one bite do you want to

160
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,770
taste one and see if you like the

161
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,370
seasoning on it

162
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,530
that's good need more cinnamon nutmeg

163
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,400
Thank You Bert so do me oh that is a lot

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,229
of nutmeg I put in there told you to

165

167
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,600
ladies can bring some of this to your

168
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,490
mom or not cuz maybe it has too much

169
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,560
nutmeg and I ruined it and now something

170
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,210
I just panic about everything for no

171
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,360
reason I'm gonna put the topping on this

172
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,440
recipe by itself was a double crisp

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,470
apple crisp so I'm pretty excited

174
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:45,130

175

186
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,539

Keeling potatoes

203
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Wow Julianne starts prepping the stuff

204
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,670
thing why don't you show them what

205
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,920
you're making so that's pretty unique I

206
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,150
don't know anybody that makes stuffing

207
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,400
that way you while I'm making really

208
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,410
special stuff in well I just kind of

209
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,910
like do a little bit traditional but

210
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,140
then I kind of have whatever I want so

211
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,500
we're doing onions celery and like bread

212
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,030
that I'm chopping up into cubes

213
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,830
l'Opera though they're big oh yeah so

214
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,810
they're little bagel thins these are

215
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,010
what I like to use for stuffing cuz

216
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,510
because it has like be everything bagel

217
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,460
seasoning and it just easy to cut and

218
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,370
prepare and then I'm adding some beyond

219
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,110
sausage cuz this is just the best thing

220
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,450
in the entire world so we've never done

221
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,370
it with that though I'm excited well and

222
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,150
also we have bacon bits which are vegan

223
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,010
because they're made out of soy it

224
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,870
doesn't make them good for you but it

225
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,540
does make them tasty I'll just be over

226
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,790
here peeling potatoes until I just want

227
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,030
to cry beginning to look a lot like a

228
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,730

233
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,490

234
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,960

236
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,710
started the stuffing officially

237
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,750
he's not gonna use a recipe he's just

238
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,400
gonna make one up I thought that you had

239
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,140
to toast these but I forgot that we're

240
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,700
not making croutons ring stuffing so

241
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,530
fasting you you're gonna have the best

242
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,300
stuffing you've ever had I'm telling you

243
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,360
so right now I have the sausage on the

244
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,610
pan after that I added some onion and

245
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,500
celery that I chopped so once that's

246
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,420
done I'm gonna put that in a bowl with

247
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,190
all of this pretty not about that big

248
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,200
pan with all of his bread and then add

249
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,960
some butter and stock and seasoning and

250
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,180
then that's that's how you make

251
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,860
something well that's how I'm gonna make

252
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,400
it so so the link will not be in the

253
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,680
description of this the link will be in

254
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,930
my mind there's no link so this is the

255
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,080
pan for making stuffing in so I'm going

256
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,170
to get this butter ready so you want to

257
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,030
do is you want your all wanna do is you

258
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,780
take a pint glass I have this much

259
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,830
butter that's good enough right

260
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,380
I keep wiping my hands on my apron I

261
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,620
 love to so this is the sausage

262
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,170
onion and celery mixture I'm adding it

263
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,930
to all the bread I'm gonna add some

264
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,230
rosemary thyme and salt

265
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,420
okay I'm gonna mix it around so we're

266
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,110
just gonna do like about a cup I think

267
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,610
sometimes I'll put stock in my Hydra

268
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,110
class when I go work out so that I'm

269
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,770
getting salt and flavor and also

270
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,270
hydrogen it's a savory gatoring savory

271
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,250
then I'm gonna put the butter orange

272
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,230
juice so you're gonna make this how many

273
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,370
minutes you wanted however many degrees

274
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,800
you want whatever oven you want or you

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,280
don't debate love and last but not least

276
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,400
this is our protein of choice for

277
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,290
Thanksgiving I'd say the julienne is

278
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,790
pretty much perfected this over the

279
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,680
years oh you might be like oh it's sort

280
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,540
of like it's vegan chicken but if you

281
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,670
add like enough like rosemary and sage

282
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,140
and thyme and stuff in there it really

283
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,450
starts to taste like turkey seasoning so

284
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,160
we're gonna do a bunch of the flour

285
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,170
tonight and then just make a little bit

286
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,490
of chicken tonight so we can show you

287
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,620
and eat some yeah

288
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,630
but tomorrow morning that'll probably be

289
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,200
the only thing

290
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,880
we make us like another little bachelor

291
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,010
camera yeah Julian really wants it to be

292
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,870
like fresh tomorrow for Thanksgiving so

293
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,760
alright so it calls for two cups of

294
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,440
flour but I'm gonna triple that leave

295
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,850
like an assembly line going where jenna

296
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,190
gets the spice ready and I just toss it

297
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,780
in here but it's about half a teaspoon

298
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,270
per spice roughly well you're making a

299
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,700
lot of regular lot so we're like

300
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,680
tripling / quadruped angel but I'll read

301
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,500
it to what it is that's flour

302
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,360
nutritionally black pepper salt sugar

303
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,140
paprika

304
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,990
rosemary ginger savory thyme sage dill

305
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,210
majorem onion powder coriander cayenne

306
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,350
pepper red pepper flakes Oh a pinch of

307
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,390
cayenne pepper but we like to make that

308
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,430
 hot if you want some spicy fried

309
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,990
chicken go a little ham on the cayenne

310
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,150
it's like a flower because you dredge

311
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,800
them and then flour them so it always

312
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,250
ends up tasting like way less and you

313
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,470
want it yeah Plus who's ever mad at

314
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,200
spicy like fried chicken mommy all right

315
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,900
so our mixture looks like a whole mix of

316
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,290
stuff which it is yeah so now I didn't

317
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,490
put salt in so now we're gonna start

318
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,230
mixing it around to make like the

319
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:38,550
full-on seasoned flour mixture to get

320
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,650
the chicken ready to be breaded you put

321
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,780
it in a buttermilk mixture butterman and

322
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,610
that's gonna come with some egg replacer

323
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,350
some almond milk some apple cider

324
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,730
vinegar you just gonna let the chicken

325
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,200
sin and so right now I'm gonna make that

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,940
yeah somewhere the only thing that I

327
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,680
really care about it Thanksgiving is

328
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,810
something I don't even have to make it

329
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,850
comes in a can and it's called cranberry

330
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,600
sauce

331
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,580
my favorite part it's in the fridge

332
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,490
right now and I can't wait to eat her

333
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,600
the most delicious part of Thanksgiving

334
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,180
- the apple cider vinegar so no one ever

335
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,740
actually give me a shot of that I won't

336
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,700
drink it disgusting okay so my potatoes

337
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,130
are finished I'm gonna have to do start

338
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,040
them on to make vegan masters hands it's

339
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,690
a crazy

340
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,449
almond milk and being better so I'm just

341
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,069
gonna do that and mash them potatoes

342
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:28,699
something came out pretty good

343
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:31,910
it looks like stuffing at least so then

344
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,290
all we have to do left is fry the

345
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,730
chicken I'm gonna use the wet hand dry

346
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,009
hand method so I can fry properly but

347
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,389
that's it and then we're gonna have like

348
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,310
a little mini face okay well for those

349
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,779
of you also wondering why we don't make

350
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,819
any gravy I have in years past made like

351
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,649
a nice mushroom gravy but like I

352
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,509
literally like forgot about it on the

353
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:58,490
counter Pappy thanks here have a

354
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,230
Thanksgiving on but many things here

355
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,379
right now yeah many things to me now and

356
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,810
real one tomorrow I think I think the

357
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,220
nice part about this is that we tasted

358
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,509
the flour dredge and it could totally

359
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,029
like use more seasoning so tomorrow we

360
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,889
can just add more spices go crazy on

361
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,410
that fried chicken seasoning it is way

362
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,240
way way less than you think of it we

363
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,800
just finished everything apple crisp

364
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,230
potatoes stuffing and fried chicken no

365
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,180
 all just things that you want

366
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,579
to eat and this is you want to eat

367
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,170
everything that I care about I don't get

368
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,160
that whole cranberries dog honestly hope

369
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,110
foods conclave me because this is like

370
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,750
not really whole berry they started just

371
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,220
like the jelly time but they're so good

372
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,579
what are you have our salt yeah

373
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,329
what do you make in dogs some sriracha

374
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:48,670
mm-hmm up in there yeah oh no no no

375
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,779
that's like what you put on chicken and

376
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,560
waffles I'm hungry me and there you have

377
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,899
it a nice vegan gluten free Thanksgiving

378
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,420
meal with absolutely no vegetables

379
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,639
because today is not the day every other

380
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,100
day is the day for that but today mm-hmm

381
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,870
I like the pepper on my mashed potatoes

382
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,389
the sausage and the stuffing is insane

383
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:10,189
that's good that shouldn't be allowed

384
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:13,430
I'm gonna be allowed oh my god

385
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,899
it's not rude to you with your hands if

386
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,639
you made it and it's in your house

387
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,569
that's a fact

388
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,790
no so one who's really good and we don't

389
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,170
have to cook tomorrow we used to roll

390
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,149
out of bed in our pajamas do whatever we

391
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:24,680
want and you know food for the first

392
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,570
time ever

393
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,580
I was saying I've literally never cooked

394
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,500
on a Wednesday to wear Thursday was just

395
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,450
like you don't have to do it have a good

396
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:33,960
time

397
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,220
well it's always like wake up and cook

398
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,480
we're gonna cook a little bit we don't

399
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,460
have to like wake up super early and get

400
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,320
everything done by 12:00 so we can go

401
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,360
somewhere you know and honestly a cool

402
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,800
part is that we got to share like what

403
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,150
we actually did for Thanksgiving with

404
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,680

407
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,160
thing as you do just a version that I

408
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,870
like looks like this is a lot of work

409
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,240
and effort and like years of trial and

410
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,040
error I would never expect someone to

411
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,110
like cook this for us so that's why we

412
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,730
always cook and bring it wherever we

413
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,040
like don't worry about us we'll be yof
