1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
ok

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,100
yeah

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:25,510
yeah

4
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:36,879
it's good to see you guys but we're going to car right there

5
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,520
not that worth it these guys are from mashable the National about their hands

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,700
on this car to like review it or something and they asked me if I wanted

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,550
to do something with them and I was like McLaren of course I want to do something

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,949
that's what we're doing is just this guy here in the cycling gear

9
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,879
he's gonna race me through the city on his street bike and i'm going to be in

10
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,199
this car and this car has 20 miles an hour and his bike goes 25 miles an hour

11
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,100
but if you've ever driven in new york city before you know that there is no

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,119
chance

13
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,470
the car can be a biker going to do it and let me driving a McLaren

14
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,570
sir good to see you you to look at those helmet cans right now

15
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,070

16
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,240
yeah i'm gonna go

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,790
repeat what this is what I'm going to be racing here

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,909
how confident are you feeling pretty government on this

19
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,360
I'm pretty confident you're gonna win - okay we're shooting the mashable video

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,360
now

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,560
not

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,320
I think that was a pretty good take my acting skills are on par this morning

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,240
this is like the starting line shot we both pull up to the starting line

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,120
yeah

25
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,200
my favorite part of this McLaren on the license plate

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,019
it says transporter today I'm literally the transporter

27
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,670
yeah

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,440
yeah

29
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,579
there's a top here now

30
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,579
great

31
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,950
NYPD loves fancy cars I've been ready since first call man

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,290
more this car right now

33
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,900
yeah

34
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,360
ok

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I think I'm in the lead so far

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,160
shoot there he bails Wow

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
and I don't stand a chance

38
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,570
so I'm not like 15 minutes into my ride and i can conclude supercars are awesome

39
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,670
but they're worthless in New York City

40
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm exactly as fast this big white then in front of me

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,840
that's to say not very fast at all you like this one you ride is crazy dude

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,580

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,700
you want to race a clam and anytime you find you never customer let me want to

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,600

63
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:12,650

64
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,000
board take the subway and then use the remaining boosted boards juice

65
