Kiernan man

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,480
diehard hundred october and predator

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,830
even without the last action here on

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,780
13th warrior and Thomas Crown Affair he

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,430
should be a legend and it's a sin that

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,740
he's not by ception also pretending to

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,789
be adversaries when you're really

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,230
friends measuring their dicks just for

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,340
the benefit of the audience cliche

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,039
what's the matter the CIA got to pushing

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,539
too many pencils are they really

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,250
armwrestling in midair have you ever

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,720
tried that it's nearly impossible

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,279
it's like Ernie saw over the top four

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,420
months before this came out and couldn't

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,309
help himself channel my team always

18
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,559
Brooks alone you know that I'm afraid we

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,090
all have our orders measures and that

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,969
game works well if Arnie's team lives by

21
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,680
its rules it turns down this job and we

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,239
have no movie so of course they have to

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,620
accept any and all last-minute

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,200
stipulations Arnold Apollo Creed Jesse

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
the body man this was kind of the

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,260
Expendables before the Expendables felt

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,480
the need to exist also Arnie and the

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,070
body two future governors were together

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,530
in two movies this year including the

30
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,510
running man it's like 1987 was giving a

31
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,859
terrible warning to California and

32
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,539
Minnesota that only Elon Musk could have

33
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,949
figured out but he was only 16 and

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,210
nobody listened the best jungle

35
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,979
camouflage is face makeup designed to

36
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,240
make you look like a wrought iron fence

37
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,950
that is half way through being knocked

38
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,680
over who's out backup no such thing old

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,930

alpha unit Rangers seal Delta team thing

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,600

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,799
don't know before the mission begins

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
okay if this is I black to help with

45
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
glare from the Sun like baseball players

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,140
use you've gone too far if this is like

47
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,250
Robert Downey jr. and Tropic Thunder

48
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,840
you've gone way too far

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,810
bunch of slack-jawed ladies and

50
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,280
gentlemen the former governor of the

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
great state of Minnesota no one will be

52
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,520
seated during the barely visible walking

53
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,630
through the jungle portion of the movie

54
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,729
anything to you was just another rebel

55
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,280
Patrol cool cool cool is anyone gonna

56

57
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,549
yards up in the air because it's super

58
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,950

71
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,920
band of soldiers need this much fuckin

72
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,990
grain so mister said I hate to feel dumb

73
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,520
he saw a guy like chopping wood to look

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,560
out to the nest some guys eating and a

75
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,150
headshot assassination but he did not

76
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,190
see any fuel dumps yes there is one but

77
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,600
he doesn't know that and neither do any

78
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,220
of the rest of these guys Dutch sets the

79
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,660
truck rolling into the camp with a bomb

80
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,550
on it but no one ever sees him or looks

81
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,840
back to see where the truck came from

82
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,250
and how convenient for him that the old

83
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,020
ass truck that isn't even being used as

84
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,790
a truck anymore still has perfect

85
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,290
alignment and continues straight into

86
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,700
its target why did you guys even plan

87
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,050
anything when you had a grenade launcher

88
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,180
just fire a dozen grenades in here sort

89
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,190
it all out later Jesus and yes there's a

90
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,540
hostage they want to save but I'll be

91
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,860
damned if anything they've done so far

92
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,540
shows any regard for the life of that

93
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,680
hostage they don't even know where the

94
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,310
hostage is apparently Carl Weathers is a

95
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,960
great ventriloquist because I didn't see

96
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,490
his lips move an inch when he said that

97
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,560
I swear to god no one in this scene

98
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,610
filled this scene on the same day that

99
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,989
the subtitles for this movie keep

100
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,190
switching between telling me these

101
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,570
guerillas are speaking Spanish and

102
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,770
Russia like they aren't even trying to

103
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,209
tell me what the English would be they

104
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,800
just keep saying speaking Spanish and

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,180
speaking Russian why even tell me the

106
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,320
language they're speaking if I don't get

107
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,150
to know the words also why hasn't the

108
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,130
predator killed any of these mother he

109
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,450
took out an entire other team of

110
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,830
American Special Forces sent here to

111
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,720
save the hostages but what the Predators

112
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,980
don't know these Russian Spanish

113
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,750
assholes are here okay fine let's

114
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,130
foolishly say he was strong enough to

115
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,570
stay upright with the kind of recoil

116
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,700
that BFG would kick back still that kind

117
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,800
of minigun spits out up to 6,000 rounds

118
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,510
per minute not only are there not nearly

119
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,590
enough shells on the ground but

120
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,330
considering we see this gun firing for

121
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,830
about two minutes during this butcher

122
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,390
block bloodbath but twelve thousand

123
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,620
rounds of ammunition alone would have

124
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,870
weighed almost 900 pounds also this type

125
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,430
of gun is so powerful it usually needs

126
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,720
its own dedicated power source to

127
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,900
operate much like my college girlfriends

128
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,640
yeah screenwriter knows this may be the

129
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,650
director too but this character sure

130
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,350
does not know this knock knock who's

131
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,300
there I'm a I'm a who I'm gonna go ahead

132
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,560
and say if you take the time to deliver

133
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,300
a lame joke two armed men before

134
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,470
shooting them that they will shoot you

135
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,580
first orange you glad I didn't say

136
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,890
banana but if this Central American I'm

137
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,080
a goddamn chatham too much racism there

138
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,850
for me to even unpacked sit at three

139
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,920
times and let's move on no traces get

140
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,130
them

141
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,510
ready to move i'm arnold schwarzenegger

142
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,550
and this is my thinking face the old how

143
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,140
much it appears as if i'm thinking son

144
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,550
of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama

145
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,590
tick you mean Nick Saban I may not have

146
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,030
explained the ball their surveillance

147
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,380
says we got you realize over the place

148
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,120
we never see any more gorillas the rest

149
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
of the film just FYI this guy has the

150
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,990
stabbing sensitivity of data from Star

151
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,130
Trek The Next Generation how did he

152
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,570
expertly stab the scorpion well not

153
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,250
stabbing any of this guy shirt or flesh

154
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,840
exactly how many times has he done this

155
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,170
before I'm Sonny Landon and this is my

156
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,150
laughter noise behold how much it sounds

157
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,800
as if I am laughing over a minute and 12

158
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,300
seconds of predator vision which is

159
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,740
basically black screen with some

160
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,540
sporadic thermal splotches barfed up

161
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,590
onto the image this is basically

162
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,420
blindness if you ask me when seeing only

163
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,040
heat signatures and hearing only garbled

164
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,180
audio put you at a fairly large

165
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,110
disadvantage overall this movie is 85%

166
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,640
people silently walking through the

167
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,950
woods while tense music plays also don't

168
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,060
you kind of get the sense that predator

169
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,530
is being with them to easily dispatch

170
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,670
the team scent before but he's been

171
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,900
watching them since they are on but

172
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,280
instead of laser offing these kill

173
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
mongers he's just watching the march

174
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,740
through the jungle he's like a horror

175
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,120
movie ghost hang around for a while

176
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,680
instead of just immediately killing the

177
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,300
ones needing killing yes it's nothing

178
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,620
major it's nothing

179
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,540
comma major or it's nothing major

180
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,550
laziest escape attempt ever basically

181
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,960
she might as well have blown air on the

182
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,000
guy or tickled him great whistle by

183
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
Arnold here let's slow that down and

184
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,820
admire how he makes that noise without

185
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,620
ever once even moving his lips

186
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,720
why is predator making these clicking

187
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,010
noises and giving away its position

188
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,780
right before it attacks ah red paint

189
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,620
this is your flood ah do you know that

190
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,760
take a look at this you better take a

191
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,500
look at this cliche just look at

192
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,240
Arnold's outfit here its pristine

193
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,010
no sign of dirt sweat blood or anything

194
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,240
else you'd think he just spent the day

195
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,980
watching NFL red zone and not you know

196
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,690
blowing up a gorilla compound after

197
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,860
crawling in the dirt and sneaking

198
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,170
through the jungle for a couple hours

199
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,120
just wait

200
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,380
animal fake out jump scares are the most

201
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,940
annoying jump scares this is the

202
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,920
greatest squandering of ammo ever put to

203
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,330
film in under a minute good thing all

204
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,860
these weapons have the unlimited ammo

205
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,480
cheat code activated on them otherwise

206
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,890
shooting this much without a target in

207
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,450
sight might be considered wasteful this

208
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,980
prisoner girl that is somehow being held

209
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,750
captive with a couple zip ties is the

210
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,550
only one to see the glowing alien blood

211
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,020
on the leap and because she's seen

212
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,220
terrible decisions in sci-fi movies

213
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,470
before she's gonna touch that I'm bill

214
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,450
Duke and this is my sad face behold how

215
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,160
much it appears as if I am sat in order

216
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,990
to be as dexterous with these tools and

217
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,370
machines as possible what do you think

218
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,480
this creature might shave down those

219
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,740
finger claws a bit I'm just sayin

220
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,150
someone needs a pretty clear where's the

221
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,370
girl I could waste several minutes

222
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,900
debating which of these fools is more to

223
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,310
blame for the girl disappearing but

224
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,110
ultimately it's both of them you see the

225
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,310
trees um duh I don't know what don't uh

226
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,710
she speaks English but setting aside how

227
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,000
and why she speaks English why did she

228
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,590
wait so long to reveal it to her captors

229
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,060
there's no reason for Ana to suddenly

230
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,320
change and be helpful other than the

231
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,490
plot needed it to happen it's not like

232
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,630
Arnie even asked nicely

233
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,100
uh he did the old I pulled out my knife

234
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,360
and it seems like I might kill you but

235
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm actually cutting a free trick bleeds

236
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,310
we can kill it yeah I guess I mean maybe

237
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,600
it wasn't blood at all maybe she saw

238
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,700
alien earwax or not maybe it was space

239
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,290
gasoline powering some kind of spacesuit

240
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,730
gizmo my point is jumping straight to

241
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,960
blood was silly jumping from the air

242
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,950
straight till we can kill it is

243
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,660
borderline certifiable it's our old pal

244
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,700
pretty up do during this oh so exciting

245
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,410
jungle snare setting montage was there

246
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,330
any reason for them or us to believe he

247
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,830
is watching them lay all these traps

248
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,170
she literally would from prisoner and

249
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,180
zip tie cuffs to speaks English now and

250
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,590
is helping with the physical labor stuff

251
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,390
in 60 seconds what makes you think he's

252
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,530
gonna come in through here there

253
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,420
tripwires and every tree for 50 yards

254
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,250
this is the only way in okay

255
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,770
first of all into what where you are

256
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,120
what makes you so certain that's after

257
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,380
you when it's spent all day watching you

258
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,670
build all these traps and everyone's

259
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,260
trying to kill you second of all you are

260
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,630
in a jungle you're not on like a skinny

261
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,100
pooping island or Peninsula

262
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,750
you're in a jungle I think could easily

263
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,520
go around and ignore your 50 yard trees

264
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,390
in this dialogue

265
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,640
almost offensive capital fails the law

266
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,490
summers means the demon who make straw

267
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,200
fish soft man we just call that the

268
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,410
Oscars touch touch double dutch look how

269
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,880
far out here Dutchess wandered beyond

270
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,110
their traps into the middle of the

271
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,330
supposed battlefield and nothing so the

272
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,100
predator either doesn't want to win or

273
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,630
doesn't want to win yet right sure

274
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,130
enough though after all these hours

275
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,630
spent sitting obvious traps out in the

276
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,160
open the predator does choose that

277
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,390
moment to show up like I think the

278
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,860
predator has a script credit that's how

279
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,500
well he knows the story beats um leave

280
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,090
it right you're fighting an alien that

281
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,650
complains in a forest background the

282
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,180
wounded are all on their own as far as

283
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,740
I'm concerned it didn't to lea because

284
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,860
it weren't armed no sports he's right

285
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,210
but it kind of ruins the fun that he's

286
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,890
right and there's no good reason he

287
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,940
should have figured that out on his own

288
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,270
anyway

289
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,160
but whatever movies gotta Arnold if the

290
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,780
predator is this visible while not even

291
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,280
moving how did it set off that trap

292
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,540
earlier right next to Dutch and he

293
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,950
didn't see it honestly once you know

294
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,940
what you're looking for I'm not sure

295
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,170
this camouflage would do all that much

296
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,840
good I'd take a severed arm continuing

297
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,400
to shoot a semi-automatic weapon as much

298
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
as the next guy but that finger

299
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
definitely came off the trigger when it

300
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,430
bounced that's it after all that Billy

301
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,840
build-up we don't even get to see

302
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,640
another unrealistic fight with outdated

303
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,930
visual effects you're really just gonna

304
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,890
schlock block us like that me what that

305
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,720
predator plasma cannon thingamajig blew

306
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,370
a hole the size of Minnesota and Jesse

307
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,020
Ventura and flew the right hook clean

308
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,460
off Apollo Creed so how was it leaving

309
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,680
Dutch here with just a flesh wound

310
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,970
classic Schwarzenegger line and all but

311
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,440
what exactly is she supposed to do when

312
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
she does indeed arrived at the choppa

313
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,790
oh hey guys no I'm just a local gal with

314
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,110
the blood of your colleagues all over my

315
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,910
shirt and all but I was distinctly told

316
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,820
to get to this here choppa wallboard

317
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,650
predator already shot him he's crawling

318
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,810
because the predator shot him so why is

319
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,250
the predator doing nothing right now

320
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,090
whilst he crawls towards a weapon as

321
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,530
Arnie flies off the edge you can clearly

322
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,060
see he is above the trees and rocks but

323
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,230
of course when he lands he has somehow

324
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,820
been transported to above water my

325
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,130
question is why even let the POV shot go

326
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,870
on long enough to see the ground below I

327
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,610
mean I know this was made at a time when

328
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,930
you were probably editing with rocks and

329
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,670
sticks and such but geez I make it so

330
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,030
obvious

331
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,040
this stuntman looks nothing like Arnold

332
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,330
and I think the movie is kind of rubbing

333
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,760
it in my face oh man here we go I'm

334
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,320
about done one of the coolest and most

335
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,240
iconic moments in movie history first of

336
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
all the

337
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,449
is almost certainly not cold enough to

338
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:00,920
lower or mask his body temperature

339
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,449
enough to make him invisible to the

340
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,009
predator second of all even if we're

341
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,690
cold enough you didn't coat his skin

342
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,730
fully or properly 30 even if the mud

343
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,410
were cold enough and evenly enough

344
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,600
applied all over touch from him crawling

345
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,860
on it how doesn't mean the predator

346
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,420
would be blind at Dutch it just means

347
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,100
the Dutch shape he sees is now a

348
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,899
different more blue color colder than

349
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,610
the branches and rocks or warmer and not

350
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,079
the same color as humans normally rain

351
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,089
but still the predator should see it

352
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,589
Dutch sized blob right in front of it

353
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,509
fourth what about his 15 eyeballs

354
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:27,889
doesn't at least some heat radiates from

355
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,810
the eyes what is the substance on me

356
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,250
that might have blinded my foe

357
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,870
I shall acquire some from my shoulder to

358
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,129
take a closer look so the audience knows

359
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,540
for sure why this happened the good news

360
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,529
is at least they didn't make him

361
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,779
actually verbalized couldn't see me damn

362
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,399
it if you knew the psychopathic alien

363
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,199
hunter was trying to track you down and

364
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,519
somehow figured out that mud kept him

365
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,569
from seeing you wouldn't you just

366
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,220
slather that stuff on before going

367
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,540
anywhere I'm just saying if it were me

368
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,920
I'd be so covered in mud it would look

369
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,180
like mr. Hankey was going on for a

370
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,589
jungle stroll you might think this is

371
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,120
where the movie went full home alone but

372
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,199
that only shows how young you are

373
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,759
because this movie is we're home alone

374
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,470
got all its initial ideas from home

375
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,300
alone was literally pitched as predator

376
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,069
with a kid in the suburbs also once

377
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,810
again very kind of the predator to piece

378
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,490
out for a long stretch of time so Dutch

379
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,779
can booby trap this section of the

380
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,550
jungle in broad daylight let's talk

381
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,170
about how Dutch tied this vine to this

382
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,389
log he wrapped it around one end over

383
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,310
and over and then tied a knot above that

384
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,230
and somehow that multi-ton log hasnt

385
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,550
simply fallen straight down out of that

386
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,680
not secure wraparound vine condom look

387
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,720
everyone Dutch made a fire at night in

388
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,639
the jungle when he knows an alien kill

389
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,319
bot with heat vision is hunting him hate

390
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:26,149
vision fire here in a bit when all his

391
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:27,920
traps are ready he's going to roar into

392
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,389
the jungle to draw the predator to it

393
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,339
and my point is why why would he ever

394
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,079
need to do that with this fucking signal

395
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,250
fire going yeah no unless he chose to

396
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,689
test fire that into the most rotten

397
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,459
deadest tree on planet earth this era

398
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,170
was a lot of all the evil things

399
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,730
predators have done I think killing a

400
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,740
platypus might be the evilest well even

401
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,149
if I buy that whole mud on your skin

402
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,680
thing applying it directly next to a

403
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,569
raging fire seems counterintuitive

404
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,880
also what is he looking at did he find a

405
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,540
mirror out here argh

406
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,100
I swear if Chris Hanson popped out right

407
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,779
now I'd take off 50 Cent's wouldn't all

408
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:00,949
these explosions be counterproductive

409
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,600
for the Predators heat vision probably

410
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,769
wouldn't whatever the predator version

411
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,420
of Smith and Wesson is have developed a

412
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,519
more non explosive weapon system oh no

413
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,649
the Predators unfair space laser is

414
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,400
broken that's too bad

415
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,690
it's breadcrumbs when the alien

416
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,370
antagonist is bleeding in intervals this

417
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,020
regular instead of easily killing him

418
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,700
here the predator traps his skull then

419
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,110
picks him up and throws him against a

420
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,730
tree then leaves him and walks away and

421
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,200
takes off his mask because he wants to

422
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,970
fight fair here at the end now that he's

423
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,620
fought unfair the whole movie to wipe

424
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,690
everyone else out an injured Dutch now

425
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,490
he wants to make sure it's mono he alien

426
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,140
and honestly he can crack the hell off

427
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,550
this does mean that the predator has

428
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,320
found a suitable mate right that's where

429
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,270
this seductive striptease is heading No

430
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,010
- some predator vision without the mask

431
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,390
looked like he still sees in heat vision

432
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,830
and other times it just looks completely

433
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,120
red if I didn't know better I think you

434
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,680
were just cycling through cool 80s video

435
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,060
effects and making it up as you go along

436
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,860
you don't have to read predator East I

437
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,180
know a good old-fashioned pointless bomb

438
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,900
countdown when you see one I want to be

439
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:07,540
the pupils government space this is the

440
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,000
when you absolutely positively got to

441
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,460
kill every mother in the room no

442
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:31,070
substitute what's your name I knew him
