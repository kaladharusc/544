1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
you know you're in san francisco when

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,290
yeah

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,360
when this is all right

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,590
saturday morning i'm still in mexico in my hotel room and i'm going to go do

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,400
something right now

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,960
don't really want to do that - like I have to do i'm posting a new 360 movie -

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,710
it's gonna be awesome and I want to do one shot in the swimming pool here and i

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,510
have this crazy dildo looking underwater housing for the thing so i'm going to go

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,040
ok

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,540
this hotel has a doing

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,610
a really amazing pool for 360 because the pool is half glass

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,260
so if you spin around the camera of the oldest he act through the pool

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,250
yeah

14
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,030
ok glad I did it so cold

15
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,130
leaving in an hour I'm not going to do the one thing that everyone back in the

16
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:33,700
states in here in Mexico advised me against doing the boosted board

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
you know I didn't carry this thing all the way from New York City and not right

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
in there is no sitting

19
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,310
the streets are closed down

20
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,350
really i think that these streets are closed down not this street but this

21
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,770
street is just people running and biking

22
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,770
this is great

23
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,450
great escape water

24
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,450
yeah

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,620

26
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,580
in mexico city for cyclists and runners and electric skateboarders

27
