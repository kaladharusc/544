42
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,019
this is honestly one of the worst parts

43
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,629
in the game this was the first time that

44
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,030
I saw the monster for the first time

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,379
when I played it so you can I think I

46
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,030
played it for like four hours or

47
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,290
something that I had to meet four or

48
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,299
five hours to get to this part right

49
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:16,190
Thank You mr. chair and I had just been

50
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,470
so diligent to make sure I don't run

51
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,280
into him so I had so much fear of the

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,690
unknown just built up and then what

53
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,909
happened was I went in here I think no

54
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,870
it was one of these similar rooms and I

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,599
I don't know if I wore my headphones the

56
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,190
wrong way or what happened but I heard

57
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,720
him and I went inside the room backwards

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,220
I'm explaining this very poorly but it's

59
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,049
oh it's a worse scare of my life I'm not

60
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,430
kidding like I've never been so scared

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,129
my life it's like I think the monsters

62
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,870
over there I open the door

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,849
then I hear a noise the monsters in the

64
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,769
room but I'm like oh shit he's over

65

this bit ever Jesus because you go in

212
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:57,439
here and you read this stupid no worries

213
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,419
now great Brandenburg is a majestic

214
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,879
creation perched upon a forest clad Hill

215
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,399
with towers reaching well above even the

216
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,669
highest pine trees following the winding

217
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,859
road leading to the gates it's the

218
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,869
impression of discovering something

219
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,659
forgotten as if journeying with Marco

220
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:18,199
Polo to the Hidden Xanadu Xanadu zonda

221
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,009
the Baron is a peculiar but gracious man

222
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,649
and he once stood well versed in worldly

223
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,869
matters and is not at all as eccentric

224
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:30,379
as I assumed my room is exquisite and

225
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,779
I'm confident that no hotel for miles

226
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,689
could even hope to match it Wow as the

227
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,779
Sun sets on brennenburg its fairytale

228
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,489
varnish turns to an eerie gloom

229
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,619
Alexander's strange servants are never

230
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,279
far away they are a quiet lot and their

231
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,639
behavior could only be described as

232
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,519
skulking Alexander seems pleased by my

233
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,729
presence as he puts it it seems like I

234
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,829
got here just in time

235
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:04,279

236
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,810

246
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,829

247

of these this is so annoying I don't

255
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,630
know why they added this because it just

256
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,550
makes you like sick yeah it's almost

257

this away it's really it's stupid how do

259
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,700
you do that that's probably one of the

260
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,809
biggest flaws of the game as I would say

261
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:28,980
excellent condition Oh

262
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,460

your bag orbit the carpet not Garber hey

316
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,010
hey it was like a father to me I loved

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,210
him like a child

318
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:27,480
Hey look we're here now hustle time so

319
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,550
you use the drain sewers as a means

320
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,440
possible yes an underground spring

321
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,110
greased quite spacious it seemed only

322
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,000
natural to incorporate it into the

323
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,500
overall structure but we won't not today

324
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,750
the flow is seasonal and when the spring

325
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,240
test-drive the dad tunnels produce a

326
00:22:52,240 --> 00:23:02,170
rather poisonous type of course we're

327
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,150
almost there this is a really cool area

328
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,240
I forgot about this they really they

329
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,080
really did a good job designing puzzles

330
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,150
I don't know it's cool

331
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,190
oh god it's a water monster here oh god

332
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,540
it's too deep

333
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,300
all right so we need to drain it duh

334
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,570
okay well it's pretty impressive for a

335
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,110
castle to have this so I I don't know I

336
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,280
thought I remember that you had to like

337
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,710
throw something at the ladder maybe I'm

338
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,570
wrong

339
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,730

340
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:53,360
because this is in the way hmm

341
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,540
I don't know

342
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:03,760
I honestly oh here we go

343
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,440
convenient glass jar that we can use to

344
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,270
grease

345
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,560
let's Greed's it up baby that's my

346

catchphrase in life huh now it's dammit

347
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,200

348
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,360
pipe is blocking whoever it's someone

349
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,400
damaged so now you throw that's why yeah

350
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,640

351
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,710

354
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,560
Suey's yeah that's everyday you climb

355
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,210
ladders in this game

356
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,179
surprisingly in the

357
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,470
wonder where I should go all right oh I

358
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,139
feel tall

359
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:04,539
so now of course what we do is we we hit

360
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,959
this one and then we hit that one and

361
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:11,949
that lowers what is his message all

362
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:12,549
right

363
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:16,449
and then whoa

364
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,719
threes oh god don't do that note to self

365
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:22,689
we enter the Syst Sister Sister Sister

366
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:23,829
that's right

367
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:29,799
Oh in this area as well this game has so

368
00:25:29,799 --> 00:26:00,669
many Oh God exactly what is he up to I

369
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:07,719
don't remember coming for Alexandra you

370
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,349

371
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,939
really like to wait my lantern guys I

372
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,409

well he can't can't be empty then can it

376
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,450
I think this is another one of those

377
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:34,880
where you have oh no what was that oh

378

380
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,600

384
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:04,830
buddy it's a lot a skillful jumping in

385
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,059
this game you have to be really good at

386
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:15,260
jumping just like I am extremely

387
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,960
described I'm not surprised

388
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,970
even while traveling across Europe I

389
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,980
assumed I would have to embrace the

390
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,000
supernatural to save my mind and life as

391
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,730
a novice I do everything in my power to

392
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,340
stay focused and not dwell too much on

393
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,309
my own doubts

394
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,990
Alexander woke me up early who told me

395
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,150
it was time we got started on our work

396
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,480
he was obviously excited Ashley headed

397
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,059
downstairs to the old dungeon where he

398
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,570
preferred to attempt his rituals his sex

399
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,010
dungeon you know in that's only by

400
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,040
DaVinci I'm sure he showed me several

401
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,450
rooms fitted a specific research such as

402
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,970
Anatomy study dead dogs and botany the

403
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,059
crown of brennenburg must be the inner

404
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,270
sanctum a most hallowed ground where we

405
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,940
shall attempt to permanently banish the

406
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,020
orbs shadow

407
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:22,650
alright let's spin oh yeah

408
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,730
I don't think that's good just a guess I

409
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,710
don't think I did anything good there

410
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,520
but you never know

411
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,510
you got to remain optimistic oh god oh

412
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,250
god I'm sorry buddy I'm sorry man you

413
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:47,010

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,160
things happen you know you live some you

418
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,670
lose some

419
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:15,960
that's what I always say so where do I

420
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,230
go from here

421
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,430
there's no way they're not having the

422
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,110
water monitor in here I do not believe

423
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,850
it well we got a little with that ladder

424
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,170
how do we do that then how am I supposed

425
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,270
to do this

426
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,120
throw my hammer throw it nope don't work

427
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,679
didn't think it would

428
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:47,700
oh maybe I can just

429
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,490
maybe throw on their throne things

430
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:58,740
usually works in this game IQ 5 million

431
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,870
I bet you were like a rabbit didn't work

432
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,080

434
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:18,390
alright look at this dude look at this

435
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,330
using my orb Alexander managed to

436
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,120
channel its power on to us I feel like

437
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,750
the orb is is another word for sex and

438
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,790
he makes this game scarier it was like

439
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,370
standing in a mad world pool of

440
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,640
impressions it was terrifying but Alex

441
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,470
are the kept calm just change orab with

442
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,380
venus tools of science in order to tame

443
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,670
the storm the blue light was stained by

444
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,700
strains of red and the walls burst with

445
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,010
pulsating tissue resonating with the

446
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,860
scene okay Ambrose that covered the orb

447
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,080
in some cloth and the unspeakable things

448
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,190
the shadow is closer than he said I

449
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,290
should prepare for a warding ritual

450
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:14,010
tomorrow now I can't I can't stop

451
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,810
imagining it and yeah damn it alright

452
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,480
let's spend time spend time spend time

453
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,230
yeah we did

454
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:28,960
okay it's this where the monster comes I

455
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
don't remember

456
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,960
okay come on don't frickin mess up now

457
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,950
feeler okay so I think I think that was

458
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:47,200
both of them shut up shut your mouth boy

459
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,740
oh it's over there as well

460
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,820
god dammit how did we get there I think

461
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,039
we have to throw a rock or something no

462
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:08,919
was that not him huh alright well let's

463
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,440
just go then Hey look there's a fish

464
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,460
that's happening okay so now we just

465
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:25,590
gotta

466
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:33,540
I'd spend time spend time oh yeah hey

467
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,270
trying to fake me out boy okay he's

468
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:46,060
definitely in there it is still early

469
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,790
and Alexander is busy preparing for the

470
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,460
ritual later today seeing him this

471
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,700
worked up makes me question why what

472
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,910
does he stand to gain I realized he is

473
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,490
curious about it all but sure there must

474
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,400
be more this is fate foolish he will

475
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,020
attempt to tame them the power

476
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,160
I admit that yesterday when Alexander

477
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,750
flooded the inner sanctum with blue

478
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,390
light I realized we had but graced the

479
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,380
orbs this might turn out to be more than

480
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,090
a shadow it might be the beginning oh my

481
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:29,530
god I can't unsee it now stop stop okay

482
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,590

so I think we're done here

488
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,810
they should have designed this puzzle

489
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,220
differently so that when you were done

490
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,950
with it you had to like go through with

491
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,030
them on sir that would have been cooler

492
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,610
just in my opinion I don't all right so

493
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,790
we are back here that's cool

494
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,650
now I think what we can do is we can use

495
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,430
these right now wait we'd already done

496
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:32,770
those well then I Oh could it be that we

497
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,150
drained the pipe so we can go down there

498
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,510
now well we shall see

499
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,390
hope tea service doesn't scratch my

500
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:44,580
thing okay here we go

501
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,340
what if I just greased myself up you

502
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,750
know oh ah and then when the monster

503
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,240
hits me you won't be able to grab me see

504
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,720

505
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,510
gonna kill me nah it's fine oh god I'm

506
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,010
gonna die I'm gonna die

507
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:18,350
I need a vaccine oh okay

508
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,490
find a vaccine are you really asking for

509
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:32,730
a lot here aren't you

510
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:40,730
I don't remember that

511
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,230
we never went in the control room did we

512
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:49,289
oh my god oh my god this part this

513
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:55,890
fricking part come on all right like

514
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,500
this

515
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,860
deep flavors an old friend back it out

516
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,630
to you

517
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:20,830
however it seems gray

518
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:26,609
and

519
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:31,640
was I talking about

520
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,920
come on move

521
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,090
there you go muscle salt I spent so much

522
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,610
time in hearing doing this puzzle I

523
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,190
remember I did a full episode just me

524
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,050
like going back and forth and everyone

525
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,840
was just losing their mind I think

526
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,700
there's a right order to do this for it

527
00:36:52,700 --> 00:37:00,500
to go all the way down like oh my god

528
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,410
that was easy I hope they did not take

529
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:11,640
me long

530
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,890
and then we put the winning crank

531
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,720
somewhere I don't remember where you

532
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,670
don't need to wait say oh yeah there's a

533
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,290
missing pipe here that needs to be

534
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,900
changed that you need to find somewhere

535
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,430
see I'm good all right don't worry this

536
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,790
is the pasta solving skills can I just

537
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:38,580
do this all right let's not we got a new

538
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,430
pipe hey piers I think I could read the

539
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,700
next character in your aneasha series

540
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,300
all right sure

541
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,170
you got the part oh god oh god oh no oh

542
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:59,310
thank god I have to hammer you out did I

543
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,360
find the pipe too early do I need to

544
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,170
stop the flow first maybe the work I

545
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,550
have put into the news machine is

546
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,980
unequaled by the reasoning of any man

547
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,900
the thought that generation of men have

548
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,430
passed away since I first attempted to

549
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,260
reconstruct the design is most tiring

550
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,540
this is a great but the limitation of

551
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,040
this world have made my work incredibly

552
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,960
difficult it has forced me to build a

553
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,000
thing almost a hundred times larger than

554
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,010
the delicate contraption it tries to

555
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,320
emulate not to mention the flow of tame

556
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,450
lightning crudely replaced by pressured

557
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,490
steam pushing it its way through the

558
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,380
pipes and turbines it shames me to think

559
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,360
that of what the interior would have a

560
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,030
thought of my monster inventor I'm

561
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,670
stupid where he works with a magnifying

562
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,320
glass to carefully fix all the part I

563
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,960
push five men to erect up a tower abroad

564
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,620
in ayran in the hope it will have even

565
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,170
the tiniest hint of power found in a

566
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,410
traveler's login okay so I think what we

567
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,109
need to do

568
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:08,110
so to add it's stuck why

569
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:23,479
geesh

570
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:27,059
okay there's something here another pipe

571
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,559
might be useful later and we have these

572
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,719
things maybe a clue right now there's no

573
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:49,300
clues great it's fine

574
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:55,880
why

575
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,809
what is that effect

576
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:06,710
what does this do

577
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,840
goddamnit I take it all back I'm a

578
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:15,170
fucking idiot his must have done

579
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,500
something

580
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:25,010
was this here before

581
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,520
maybe needs to be balanced so maybe one

582
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,140
of them is stuck maybe this one is stuck

583
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,090
oh there you go so I need to balance it

584
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,790
out okay so one of them is just the

585
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:45,410
height of that pipe and okay well no

586
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,510
wonder this took me forever Jesus Christ

587
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,600
oh it's the pipes over here there you go

588
00:40:52,600 --> 00:41:05,290
okay I got it okay guys this is epic

589
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:10,360
okay so the last one goes I guess you

590
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,010
just put them randomly I don't I don't

591
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,530
know

592
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,940
it's all about balance I guess the

593
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:23,910
puzzles did I put them their own order I

594
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,820
don't know

595
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,900
possibly

596
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,300
yeah look oh yeah they come off okay I

597
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:39,920
see look I did it guys

598
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,059
there must be one more pipe then I'm

599
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:47,690
missing a pipe must be hiding somewhere

600
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,700
where are you pipe there you go

601
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,960
okay now I think the only thing is to

602
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:01,579
match yeah yeah you know what are you

603
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:05,599
doing so I think I heard a sound before

604
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,299

605
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:12,710
