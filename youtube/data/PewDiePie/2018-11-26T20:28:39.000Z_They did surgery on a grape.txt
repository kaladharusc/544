you can apply this information to literally

81
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,200

82
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,700

they did surgery on a grape.

98
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,640
but a lot of people don't understand that surgery does-

99
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,420
come with a risk involved;

100
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,120

It'S nOt OkAy

283
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,980
*Pewds stares at us* (for a third time)

284
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,080
you think I'm use to bullying?

285
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
you think I'm used to being treated like a

286
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,660
like a laughing stock every single day

287
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,200
no one takes me seriously

288
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,880
i have thoughts, i have feelings
(sure you do)

289
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,840
no one cares about them
(you're right we don't)

290
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,040
so this is what I get

291
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,540
*ding*

292
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:30,880
*shitty music*

293
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,980
(wait a minute,,,)

294
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,040
someone took a picture

295
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
sn unsolicited image

296
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,500
in my own spare time

297
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,700
minding my own business

298
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,220
returning the shop from the shopping centre

299
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,680
and people just photoshop it

300
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,960
to make it look like...

301
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,580
the cart is taking me back

302
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,160
or

303
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,500
that- the legs swapped

304
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,320
really clever (x2)

305
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,040
oh because I don't have legs?

306
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,840
is that why?

307
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,700
dehumanising.

308
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,080
yOu'Re DeHuMaNiSiNg Me

309
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,320
i do have legs

310
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
it was a joke

311
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
i swear to god i have legs
(sure you do)

312
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
oh you're trying to rub it in

313
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,200
that i'm not part of Disney anymore

314
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
is that what this is?

315
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,440
lego version!

316
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
at least I can appreciate the aesthetic of this meme

317
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,520
thank you very much
(you're welcome pewds)

318
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,320
oh look at that,

319
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,820
the tables have been turned

320
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,220
what even is this!

321
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,260
*laughing*

322
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,140
okay see, this one makes sense

323
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,560
because if i don't have legs

324
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,240
this is how i'd go around

325
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,540
this is actually the un-photoshopped version

326
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,060
this is the original

327
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
of this meme

328
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,880
what even is this then?

329
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,780
it doesn't even make

330
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,400
any

331
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,060
fricken

332
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,880
sense

333
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,380
hey look!

334
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,280
no legs

335
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,240
how 'bout that

336
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,220
this is the un-edited version!

337
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,020
of this meme

338
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,720
we found it

339
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,760
finally

340
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,300
oh my god
goddamnit

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:46,300
*more shitty music*

342
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,860
*snickers*

343
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
*clap* ?

344
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,080
but of course

345
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,780
like all good memes

346
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,400
they will find one day

347
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,700
a peer meme review

348
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,260
to see their last...

349
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,320
..moment

350
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,140
*press f in comments to pay respects*

351
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,060
to take their last breath

352
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,300
and- and this meme is no exception

353
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,200
*clap* ?*clap* ?

354
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,380
this meme gets a

355
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,920
*contemplating his life*

356
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
*short laugh*

357
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,820
*mumble*

358
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,400
sorry I was just thinking about

359
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,440
something else

360
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,180
*dead inside*

361
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,580
this meme of course gets a

362
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,500
10/ten

363
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,160
because it involves me

364
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,720
so

365
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,980
it's automatically 10/ten

366
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,480
*clap* ?
