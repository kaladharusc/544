whatever is close by

198
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,600

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,030
super fast right now so do we have to

200

at least it is at least the the

209
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,920
characters in game would tell us

210
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,060

328
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,750
stuff jeez you're stung the tongue of a

329
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,350
my son katana thing I thought brake

330
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,510
setup I hear that I think it's coming

331
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,450
back here dad once we killed his babies

332
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,060
that's why good um this thing can't come

333
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,060
down here can it so how we decided to

334
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,470
figure out what this is is this like

335
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,640
snow what is this

336
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,770
I have no it's making this Crouch

337
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,770
because I saw my figure this out it's

338
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,130
dark hardcore flashlight I don't even

339
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,390
have the flashlight oh yeah yeah the

340
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,310
flashlight oh no I gave it to you that's

341
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,580
right that's gone now did you use that

342
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,230
down here you hear that

343
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,070
okay I got it no no no nope oh the

344
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,930
hatching that's why they're hatching

345
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,000
yeah they're hatching

346
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,720
oh no tie okay I'm running yeah we run

347
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,660
run run run run from the eggs eggs

348
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,449
exactly exactly what we do egg salad

349
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:44,379
like an exotic we're here what is this

350
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,060
hiding rooms because these are hiding

351
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,269
doors Sampras door whoa whoa laughing

352
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,930
Wow Wow

353
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,490
is this the main reactor okay Charlie

354
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,629
how do I get this thing going you have

355
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,160
to pull the power discharge level on

356
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,029
them

357
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,390
on each of the four outlying towers then

358
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,069
use the console at the main tower it

359
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,789
sounds easy enough

360
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:10,819
I can't even boot them off the edge okay

361
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,809
what is this bridge access override cut

362
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,439
with blow torch in an emergent large I

363
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,699
don't have it's probably something you

364
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,589
get over in this area probably Yee we

365
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,909
got to find a blowtorch so we can go

366
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,740
over there okay I'm gonna assume it's

367
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,280
over here

368
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,929
yeah I'm gonna get this little torch

369
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:35,150
okay what space has a floor that's not

370
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,630
supposed to happen okay base has a floor

371
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,549
space is a lie okay let's do the

372
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,360
blowtorch

373
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,559
hey what does the boy what what did it

374
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:48,799

me the thingy nope oh wow

385
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,900
it's time okay currently the blowtorch

386
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,720
it's one time boom cut it I am hurry up

387

388
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,120
there we go did you see the black thing

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,620
he actually oh yeah like you're heating

390
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,980
up yeah that's actually pretty cool how

391
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,730
is he floating he's gone oh yes yeah

392
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,820
that made the little bridge thing all

393
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,370
right now we got a okay this is the

394
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,310
power to the main reactor okay we got to

395
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,080
go to the fort little towers you go to

396
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
one tower we'll go to one tower then we

397
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,800
got to deactivate it okay I'll go to the

398
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,860
east I guess well you need to blow torch

399
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,510
that's my question do I question mark no

400
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,540
no you don't okay good I like the little

401
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,190
lightning I think that's pretty cool yes

402
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,230
so just play the budget and the lover or

403
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,070
just one I just did both until the thing

404
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:28,430
said did you do I thought of venturous

405
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,520
oh sure I did it again

406
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,000

oh yeah it did so one more

410
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:50,520
and then we go to the center oh I'll

411
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,340
wait at the center no when the Android

412
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,690
oh my gosh I almost died oh there's like

413
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,240
a little platform over there all right I

414
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,830
did it work okay

415
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,220
please try you okay tactical healing oh

416
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,260

417
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,240
don't know this is please wait look all

418
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,130
pretty cool

420
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,740
whoa a seizure procedure yeah

421
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,510
main reactor activated successfully

422
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,330
stupid wise hey yeah all the other ones

423
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,240
are kind of quiet this was weird I think

424
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
actually I think it's like wow now that

425
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,900
there's a cooling rod control room is

426
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,210
this the thing way up here is it is it

427
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:47,179
let me go check I guess so

428
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,380
actually wait before we click it I I

429
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,850
think is a good time to pause it for a

430
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,330
