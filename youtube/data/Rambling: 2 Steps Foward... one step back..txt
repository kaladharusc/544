1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,250
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,929
YouTube boogie2988 coming at your live

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:05,370
was again through the power all the

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,810
internet and this is my rambling series

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,950
as my vlogging stories what you're

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,210
talking about life the universe things

7
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,139
around us that are particularly

8
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,790
interesting to me instead of the YouTube

9
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,080
channel estate of YouTube in general the

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,160
state of my life in general

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,809
my mental my physical and my emotional

12
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,910
well-being and I hope you enjoyed that I

13
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,180
try to do it with low editing or low you

14
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,100
know any bullcrap it's just me and you

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,960
setting down having a conversation like

16
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,910
friends and that's how I feel it is and

17
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,010
I hope you feel that the same way I am

18
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,390
gonna talk about my mental health and my

19
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,470
emotional health a little bit in this

20
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,210
video I know that turns a lot of people

21
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,829
off sometimes but I think it's also

22
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,570
really important to talk about from time

23
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,219
to time especially where I'm at the

24
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,440
point that I'm at right now I need to

25
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,670
talk about it and I hope that you'll

26
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,950
listen I do want to talk about the state

27
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,149
of the YouTube channel a little bit

28
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,469
before we get started so we're now in

29
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,660
our third week of Friday's with Francis

30
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,700
this weekend will be the the one month

31
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,489
anniversary starting that it seems to be

32
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,050
doing very well the views continue to go

33
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,670
up subscribers continue to go up numbers

34
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,879
continue to go up the income continues

35
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,520
to drop so I can no longer count on the

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
Friday video to bring in any income and

37
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,090
it's not that I'm getting the a little

38
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,549
yellow demonetized signal they have now

39
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,979
found a way to monetize Francis videos

40
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,630
without telling me they are to

41
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,430
monetizing them so let's say a video

42
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,320
like today's video might bring in a

43
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,110
hundred dollars the Friday with Francis

44
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,939
videos are bringing in maybe ten or

45
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,189
fifteen dollars for the same number of

46
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,869
views and that's even if I'm keywording

47
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,250
it correctly and using mattad that and

48
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,869
using a hot topic and using like talking

49
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,240
about the Spider Man game I could not

50
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,670
get paid for advertisement they did not

51
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,810
want to advertising I don't know how

52
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,100
they're doing that is that they

53
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,630
recognize Francis as a negative keyword

54
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,460
down and he recognized Bethesda because

55
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
I swear in the video I don't know but

56
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,869
they figured out a way here's the thing

57
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,430
though I'm not worried about it what's

58
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,570
the difference what's eighty five ninety

59
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,009
dollars I guess at the grand scheme of

60
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,299
things as long as you're enjoying the

61
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,130
videos and I'm enjoying the videos the

62
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,270
only way I think I'll stop doing

63
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,100
Friday's with Francis is if it does

64
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,570
begin to jeopardize the channel as a

65
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:54,840
whole

66
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,579
I really am enjoying filming them now I

67
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,140
know a lot of you want the classic style

68
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,299
of Francis with somebody behind a camera

69
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,340
and the ranting and the raving and stuff

70
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,560
like that I do think that is coming for

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
now the rants in front of this camera I

72
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,369
really enjoy doing but we are making

73
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,590
plans and hiring people and looking at

74
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,720
going big especially towards the

75
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,830
holidays

76
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,630
as long as these Frances videos continue

77
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,270
to perform well we'll continue to do it

78
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,500
Frances is still problematic in a lot of

79
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,120
ways because a lot of people try to use

80
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,890
that against me they try to say well

81
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,450
that's who he really is some people are

82
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,980
confused they don't know that Francis is

83
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,480
a character they don't know why is this

84
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,130
voice different why see why so angry in

85
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,420
this video I thought he was a nice guy I

86
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,860
thought he was a cool guy you got to

87
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,780
deal with that every once in a while but

88
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,160
I guess you can't be worried about those

89
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,450
types of people as long as the mass

90
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,490
group of you guys enjoy it then we're

91
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,840
gonna be fine right as long as you

92
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
hopefully the person watching this who's

93
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,830
relatively sane and capable of

94
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,240
understanding the Francis as a character

95
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,200
as long as you guys are enjoying it

96
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,170
that's all that really matters um so

97
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,520
let's talk about the mental health stuff

98
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,020
now I'm on the second week of a new

99
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,660
antidepressant I'm really starting to

100
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,370
fill it um and I want to talk about

101
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,990
depression for me I think a lot of

102
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,890
people when they talk about depression

103
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,790
they are used to sadness like I'm really

104
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,020
depressed my mom died I'm really

105
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,100
depressed my dog died I'm really

106
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,570
depressed my boyfriend broke up with me

107
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,610
depression I think clinical depression

108
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,680
medical depression is very different for

109
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,290
a lot of people myself included medical

110
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,580
depression is not sadness its numbness I

111
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,170
can't feel sad when I'm depressed I

112
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,110
can't feel anything um I know I'm very

113
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,640
aware that the situation in my life

114
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,470
right now should be a very sad situation

115
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,750
with the divorce and everything else and

116
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,660
with my messed up teeth and my aging

117
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,760
body and you know not being in a

118
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,260
relationship and wanting to be stuff

119
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,239
like that I understand that but I could

120
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,650
never really feel it through the divorce

121
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,450
that's why when a lot of people like

122
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,130
you're faking it but really divorce

123
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,510
really bothers you is like none

124
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,010
depressed man I can't even feel it

125
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,470
I can't even doesn't even bother me it's

126
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,989
just a thing that happened now that I'm

127
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,340
on a new anti-depressive and it seems to

128
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,739
be working most of the time when I take

129
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,790
a new antidepressant

130
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,180
I feel the bad feelings first I feel

131
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,090
very very sad for a while sometimes they

132
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,989
feel fairly angry sometimes I feel all

133
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,820
the you know depressive and miserable

134
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,600
feelings that you feel um and that's why

135
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,739
I'm starting with a new therapist to

136
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,709
coincide with this antidepressant I

137
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,120
started with one this weekend now I'm

138
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,530
gonna continue using the folks over

139
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,060
better help as I've told you guys before

140
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,100
them they sponsor me here I'm using them

141
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
still every day I'm talking to them

142
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,850
every day but I want something more

143
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,169
intense and I want to talk to a

144
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,060
psychiatrist who can help me find the

145
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,620
right meds

146
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,020
and balance the right meds so that we

147
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,690
hopefully make a really good lasting

148
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,910
impact here I don't know what that's

149
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,620
gonna mean for the YouTube channel I

150
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,460
don't know what its gonna mean for

151
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,840
streaming does it mean I might need to

152
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,639
take a break as I adjust to these new

153
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,760
medications does it mean I I won't be

154
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,290
able to work as much as I want be able

155
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,460
to film as much as it won't be able to

156
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,040
stream as much as I want I don't know

157
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm not afraid to take personal days

158
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,040
during this transition I'm not afraid to

159
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,660
do the things that I need to do during

160
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,100
these transitions and I hope that you

161
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,810
won't be upset with me if I do

162
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,060
at the end of the day it might screw me

163
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,770
up in the algorithm and might screw me

164
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,910
up on the momentum of the channel it

165
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,139
might me screwed me up on a lot of other

166
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,770
reasons but it doesn't matter because

167
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,880
number one comes first you got to take

168
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,050
care of number one before you take care

169
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,560
of number two not in the bathroom I

170
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,550
don't mean that in the bathroom I mean

171
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,160
that I mean that in in in when it comes

172
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,110
to people I don't mean that you can

173
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,240
number two all you want but I don't this

174
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,330
is why I get to monetize okay so let's

175
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,580
talk about physical health a little bit

176
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,419
um so if you guys remember I broke my

177
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,150
femur and my doctor said I also broke

178
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,590
the ball joint and I broke my femur

179
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,810
straight across my doctor told me

180
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,060
something and you may remember I quoted

181
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,740
that he said that my recovery would take

182
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,020
a year and I believed him in that but he

183
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,250
also told me I would never be able to

184
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,039
raise my left arm my other arm above my

185
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,340
head like this but with physical therapy

186
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,990
I have been practicing and I want to

187
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,729
show you something kind of cool the

188
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,680
number one I can do this which I'm not

189
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
sure that I should be able to do just

190
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,580
yet it's very painful still but if I'm

191
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,990
willing to ignore the pain and I'm

192
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,190
willing to push through I can in fact

193
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,889
get my hand above my head now do you

194
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,090
think it's gonna be a while till I have

195
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,070
full range of motion for my arm because

196
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,570
there are still things I can't do I

197
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,130
can't reach behind my back yet and I

198
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,370
also can't reach

199
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,560
behind my head no matter how hard I try

200
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,539
my arm just doesn't Bend that way

201
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,190
anymore this one does it fine but I

202
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,090
can't do it I can't do it with that arm

203
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,130
just yet now physical therapy I think

204
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,810
it's gonna continue to increase my range

205
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,150
of motion all the time the good news is

206
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,910
I need to do this a lot more than I need

207
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,250
this so I think what has happened here I

208
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,020
think the arm the way that the ball

209
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,670
joint broke is just different than the

210
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,430
way he thought it broke we did that last

211
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,200
x-ray last week last I think was

212
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,850
Thursday we took a look at the arm again

213
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,700
and we saw what was going on and he says

214
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,230
the ball joint is at a place and that

215
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,050
the the bone itself healed with curved

216
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,410
so that would mess up my range of motion

217
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,430
but it didn't mess it up in the way that

218
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,900
he thought it does still seem like it's

219
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,310
messed up I think it's gonna take a

220
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,650
while to go but the good news is if I

221
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,120
ever need to reach and grab something

222
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
off the top shelf I'm not too far from

223
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,290
being able to do that and the best part

224
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,870
is the the the bruises on this arm are

225
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,790
finally healed almost seven weeks later

226
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,890
and we're almost there

227
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,670
so the good news is the good news is if

228
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,980
you wrap all of this together physically

229
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,430
I'm healing mentally I'm healing here on

230
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,380
YouTube the YouTube channel is healing

231
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,110
it took us a while to get here

232
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,590
it we were making negative momentum for

233
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,330
a very long period of time we were we

234
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,610
were both mentally and physically and

235
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,710
emotionally and even here on the channel

236
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,380
we were taking steps backwards but for

237
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,060
every two steps forward you take a step

238
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,900
back from time to time

239
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,820
um I feel like we're back to making

240
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,200
progress again and I'm pretty happy

241
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,060
about that so I hope you guys are happy

242
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,500
