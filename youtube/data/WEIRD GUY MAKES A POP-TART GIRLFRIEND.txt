00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:16,890
So I had that dream where I drowned you guys again... hahaahahha

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:24,210
You need help. It's not funny. It's Great. GUYS , our weekly snack shipment came in, they gave us more pop-tarts (GASP)

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,950
You guys realize what this means, right?

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,220
Someone's missing the most important meal of the day? One of us will die in a breakfast pastry battle royale? my mom never really loved me?

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,840
No! Well I mean that's obvious but no guys more is better and right now

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,730
We are pop-tart rich so we need to spend all these pop-tarts before anybody realizes their mistake any ideas

7
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,870
I'm gonna get myself some more Noah and hire him as my personal chauffeur. NOISE

8
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,569
*Grunting heavily* Okay, I thought you meant I'm going to be taking my car

9
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:59,400
We will be and you'll be carrying me in there too up, up the steps. Can't we just take the elevator. I'd really need the exercise

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,500
*Continues to grunt heavily as if he is choking*

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500

Oops my bad. Oh good. You got hat insurance right no. Just take this

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh. Ooh!

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,030
Hi

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,810
Yeah, I need an ambulance for a broken vertebrae yeah, I'll pay in pop-tarts

20
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:38,280
What? What do you mean pop-tarts aren't real money? Well fine. I guess I'll just take my business elsewhere!

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,220
Rude

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,700
*grunts and screams In agony*

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,860
bubble noise

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,540
I'm gonna make my life more musical

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,440
*Suffering goat noises*

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:00,960
You've got an email We'll tell you in song it's from his plastic surgery, it's about his little (dong) whoa, okay? Um, it's not what you think

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,220
He's singing about my feet

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,160
Eeewwww.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,830
Okay, okay, just take your pop-tarts. MMMM. feet pitter pattering away

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,520
Hey, do you guys think you could pay me back for those voice lessons they were like five grand. Oh sure! Oh...

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,960
Okay, but I paid in real money. heh

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,140
The goat screams go on

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,790
Wait can anyone explain to me why in each of your dream scenarios

34
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,900
I'm the one getting screwed over? Stop talking Noah. Okay. I have the best idea

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,910
What's the one thing you always want when you eat a pop-tart? Milk. Milky water. An emotionally distant mother who also loves milky water.

36
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,450
Stop talking Noah. What I'm talking about is more complete silence for me to eat my pop-tart in peace

37
00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:02,900
Which is why I shall construct the perfect eating companion. Who I can like also maybe... Date heeheehee. WOOWAHWAHWOOWOOWOO

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,360
Wow... You're so beautiful especially now with more frosting

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,280
ding

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,960
you know?

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,890
I've never really felt beautiful. I know I am, but I just don't feel it.

42
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,250
Can I kiss you?

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,530
A Boyfriend???

44
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,630
Noah??

45
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,900

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,780
WHAT THE HELL. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JUST IN A DREAM SEQUENCE!

48
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,980
My whole life is a dream sequence.

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,200
*Intense music continues*

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,990
*Slaps* Sorry Shane just made it look really fun

51
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,460
Well the FUN?

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,020
Is over now cause. I'm getting revenge on you

53
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,470
And you and you for what you did to me in your dream sequences cause in my dream sequence

54

I'm gonna take the pop-tarts and I'm gonna get more...

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,980
They're all gone.

56
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,400
What? Yeah I traded all the pop-tarts for real money. We don't want that

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,180
Yeah, how am I supposed to purchase goods and services with money? You crazy? I mean I'll take the money. I could invest it... no(all)

58
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,440
guys

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,360
Let's just burn it all and move on with our lives

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,400
GOOD IDEA

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,000
More pop-tarts just like money, but not.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,830
thank you to pop-tarts for sponsoring this video

63
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,070
