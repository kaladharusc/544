1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,480
Ball. Ball. Ball. Pass it.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,380
Coby

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,600
Alright! What the effing heck kiddos!?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,140
I asked you to hustle out there and you barely move around! What's the deal?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,220
It's first period Mr.Ratbush, we don't want to be sweaty all day.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,560
Just shower in the locker rooms you dumb nuts

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,820
NOOOO!

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,840
That's a no?

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,033
Does a 3-pointer have to be behind the line?

10
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,560
Uh, did my wife leave me?

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,760
Yeah, yeah. She did. We all saw that happen.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,840
Every P.E. Class Ever

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,260
I, Jesse, of sound mind and free will leave this as my last will and testament.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,000
To my brother, I leave my room.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,880
To my mother, i leave my estate.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,200
Which is mostly dirty laundry.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,100
If I die while on life support.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,110
Do not resuscitate

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,789
What are they doing? They gotta run a mile that's so sad. :(

20
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:00,670
Dweebs realize you can just walk the mile?

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:17,620
Walk?! A whole mile?! Are you crazy?!

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,680
Every PEh Class Ever

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:31,030
Alright kids. Today is dodgeball day which means I've separated the groups into two equal teams of nerds,

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,680
versus jocks.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,860
You die in the game, you die in real life!

26
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,570
Coach Ratbush, this doesn't seem fair.

27
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,060
I know. I just want to relive the glory days of nerds gettin' pummeled.

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,320
We- well... We're not going to stand for it anymore! Cause I refuse to play coach Ratbush

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,280
Let's go captain man.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,540
Hahaha!

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,740
Get him boys

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,080
Your out!

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:16,100
Ewww Clark's wearing tighty-whities! And he got dookie stains!

34
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,040
Hey. I really need to skip P.E. class today.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
You got the money, I got the honey.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,140
What?

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,460
Nothing just give me five dollars

38
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:31,840
All right. Here you go. You have asthma now no more running for you.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
Hey. I really need to get out of P.E. this week man. It's square-dancing week.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,110
I got you

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,720
Take these ketchup packets.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
What are these for?

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,300
You're on your period.

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,560
Worked great for Jenny last week trust me.

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,740
Okay.

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:59,340
(He's blind! Plot twist!)

47
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,840
Really?

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
Yeah! I was confused at first too!

49
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,530
All right. Well, you're lucky I've never taken a science class and i don't know how to goggle things on my phone.

50
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,099
Yeah. I guess just sit over there with the other menstruaters.

51
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,820
*grunting*

52
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,660
Smells like ketchup makes me hungry for a hot dog.

53
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,680
Whoa! Brent has armpit hair! Cooooooool!!

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,660
Lets go, lets go, lets go.. Come on!

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,959
Oh, I'm sorry coach Ratbush! I just I don't think i know the proper technique for rope climbing.

56
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,569
Maybe you could demonstrate...?

57
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:38,100
Okay. Back up dweeb

58
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,080
Goes a little something like this.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,640
oh, Jesus!

60
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,140
*grunting*

61
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,840
Okay you know what! We don't we don't need to climb ropes nobody actually needs this.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Plus, it's a total safety hazard.

63
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,090
Alright, everybody take a break.

64
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,709
How does one fail P.E.?

65
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,820
