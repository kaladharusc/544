14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,300
This photo was sent out and it became an immediate cat sensation

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
It was a cat strophe....

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,138

Thanks to this cat what a polite little kitty

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,350
How is this a meme yo bring a friend for my home boy. Is he cute? Is he cute?

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:25,840
Yeah, my person cute man. So you see that's where the trouble began

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,380
I know you were trouble when you cat in

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,570
Let's just move on this mean gets a three. I don't know what to tell you. It's another picture of a cat

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:46,750

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,399
Suck his eyes. That's not gay. It's just not gay

29
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,770
This is literally me when another cat makes it into cat meme compilations

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,920
Moving on do not bully people

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,230
Do not make fun of anyone what's going on guys? Today I'm gonna tell you how to get a

32
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:14,990
Absolutely incredible item from llama's behind?

33
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,390
Next meme is MoMA

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:24,680
Next me Takashi the fastest cloud sound rapper in the game

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:32,660
We have seen his palette. We have seen his strengths and we have seen how strong he is

36
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,590
But new evidence have arozen that's the word be quiet arisen that shows that he was actually much

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:47,420
Listen here. Come closer. He's much faster. You can add it then you can never believe what I'm about to show you is highly classified

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,620
confidential

39
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,554
Government protected footage of Tekeshi's 6ix9ine

40
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:53,950
. I know his name is not Tekeshi 6ix9ine

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,320
It's just easier for me to say it. (6ix9ine) &quot;I hate when people like

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,040
Underestimate me like how fast I am a from one video

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,380
I'm fast as f***&quot;

44
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:22,720
HE ZOOM

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,870
6ix9ine and his girlfriend but who the lady- who the lady holding his girlfriend?

46
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,970
Caption this when your last two brain cells meet is that woah vicky heck ya

47
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:41,580
The reason why I'm bringing up Takashi what was 6ix 9ine again is cuz he was in trouble guys. That's right

48
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,910
I'm starting a

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:50,560
GoFundMe page to save takeshi's bill of a hundred and fifty thousand bail. It's called bail he got arrested for

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,600
Skipping out on a court date to face charges that he'd choke a fan. Listen. He's a great guy. All right, so, please

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,380
let's start this GoFundMe page and see how much we can raise and I swear on my honor as a

52
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,390
Youtuber I will donate all the money to takeshi's bail

53
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,620
He needs to get out of bail if Takeshi doesn't get out of bail

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,750
I don't know what I'll do what other rappers scream extremely loud during their song

55
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,920
I don't know why I'm memeing this so hard. I actually like him. It seems like everyone hates him

56
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,140
He's just he's like a little can I say?

57
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,840
сгущенное молоко

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,620
Can I say?

59
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,320
сгущенное молоко

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,020
He's like, I mean it as an endearing way. He's a cute little

61
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,760
сгущенное молоко

62
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:52,200
That's not bad. That's not a bad word, please. It's a wonderful word for a wonderful person

63
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,210
The alien is back the dame tu cosita out of the casita

64
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,200
The alien is back the dame tu cosita out of the cosita

65
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,220
The cousin of cosita is back

66
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,940
The cousin of cosita is back

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,730
I don't believe it either because it's such a bad meme

68
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:10,420
Why why did this one have to come back out of all memes that can come back and make a rebound?

69
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,030
This is--no one asked for this who asked for this who wanted this one duper come back

70
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,550
I didn't hey, you know, we'll make a great meme? This metal looking alien dancing

71
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,280
Imagine having sleep paralysis and seeing this at the foot of the bed

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,660
Just again breaking it down and you can't do anything about it.

73
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,240
Like you hear the music in the bag and everything

74
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,460
Bruh

75
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,980
That is one of the most horrifying experience

76
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,340
I could ever imagine

77
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,440
Now I want sleep paralysis, oh, there it is

78
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,160
My god, I am terrified right now. It went from funny cute lil' meme to

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,080
savage heart in an instant

80
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:10,420
これはいいアニメです

81
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,820
This metal alien is literally everywhere

82
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:32,300
Recarnation of Brad 3

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300

IT was him

87
00:06:47,780 --> 00:07:11,000
First time I laugh at this stupid meme which is one more time than anyone ever will

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,340
Imagine having sleep paralysis

89
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,110
and seeing

90
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:22,130
PewDiePie at the foot of the bed just breaking it down and you can't do anything about it like

91
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,840
You hear the music in the back and everything?

92
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,520
What you get a 1 like what is this who is here before PewDiePie meme reviews it

Xfinity, where do I sign them?

104

Finally a company that gets it

105

108
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,870

Are they going to confirm the alien dancing guys?

112

Great power. It makes me feel good. It makes me feel great and lifts me up

115
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,320

Coming home

It's coming home is it as soon as Sweden lost against England people just couldn't stop tweeting at me. Oh

120
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,310

122
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:39,680
Disgusting even trying to threaten my own show meme review he changed he changed the title

123
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,710
It was meme reviewing the type he know as soon as England lot

124
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,530
This was called its coming home meme review. How dare he try to steal my show and then

125
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:57,580
England lost and boom meme review deleted suddenly the meme isn't so funny now, isn't it?

126
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,980
Because this England is coming home. It's not coming home. It's going home. And please stay there, England

127
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:17,190
I mean, I'm in England right now. What doesn't matter shut up. This video is really funny now after England lost

128
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,880
It's not your you're going home like everyone else

129
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,329
No one likes you. No one likes Sweden either. I don't know why I have nothing to boast about

130
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:34,459
You know what? I like to do the most in the whole world. I like to grab a monster energy drink not sponsor

131
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,800
I like to crack that open

132
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,089
Fire up my

133
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:50,220
Playstation 4 Pro and I like to hold it like this and the first the first set the saliva in my mouth is already

134
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,820
And then I fire up World of Tanks and I'm ready and then that's how I know

135
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm living if you're not sipping on a monster drink, then you ain't living Center. That's right

136
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,269
I'm almost 30 years old and I review memes. What can I say?

137
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:12,959
We're a classful bunch of people that likes to sip on a drink a drink that doesn't does just doesn't represent

138
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,370
Capitalism it represents what the world could be

139
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,459
While you kids you have your Takashi

140
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:24,120
6-9. We are sipping our way

141
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,560
When our Monster energy drinks and I feel bad

142
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,000
you know whenever I see someone that isn't sipping on a monster energy drink it upsets me because

143
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,660
I have so much empathy in my heart and in my soul, like if you ain't zipping you ain't livin

144
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,970
It really doesn't taste get

145
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,920
All the memes were garbage this week. Well, do you think that's my fault?

146
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,160
