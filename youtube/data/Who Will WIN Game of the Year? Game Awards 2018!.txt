00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,220
was again through the power of the

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,660
internet and it's that time of year

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,210
again where we look at the game awards

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,280
see who got nominated for what and talk

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,259
about who is going to win of course i

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,160
want to hear what you have to say in the

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,570
comments section below and then this

10
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,580
year you're actually gonna watch me cast

11
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,890
my votes for the the winners so let's go

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,359
ahead and bring up the page don't forget

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800

16
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,680
youtube you can watch it just about

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,539
anywhere i haven't decided if I'm going

18
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,210
to travel out this year to go to the

19
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,280
game Awards or if I'm wearing to coast

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
remit from here I might actually go if

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,660
you guys remember I won a game award

22
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,620
back in 2016 so who knows I might

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,879
actually show up it's a game of the year

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,320
I think we should come back to Game of

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,850
the Year I want I want that to be the

26
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,550
final category we vote on because I want

27
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,320
to vote for some of those games in other

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,360
categories before we really talk about

29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,340
the discussion discussion it's the best

30
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,260
ongoing game this is an interesting one

31
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,300
awarded to a game for outstanding

32
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,340
development of ongoing content that

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,899
evolves the player experience over time

34
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,530
so we have destiny to Forsaken I didn't

35
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,210
really mess with destiny too so I can't

36
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,000
really vote for that for tonight as much

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,430
as people love to hate on that game they

38
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,500
do a lot right over there specifically

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,439
each season doing completely different

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,540
stuff and bringing in different content

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,220
and knowing that there's seasonal

42
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,200
content with each battle paths with each

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,530
season and I don't know man I don't dive

44
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,939
into that game a lot but I watch my

45
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,159
friends play it every once in a while no

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,860
man's sky mmm this is interesting

47
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,040
because no man's sky continues to update

48
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,689
after all this time and unlike a game

49
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,670
like fortnight or destiny they're not

50
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,380
cranking out paid content they're

51
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,240
cranking out free content

52
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,340
overwatch very similar of course they do

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
have micro transactions built into it as

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,729
well the same way for a knight does oh

55
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,079
you can though it's just cosmetic and

56
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,030
overwatch continues to get updated with

57
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,399
cool content and then Tom Clancy's

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,930
Rainbow six siege this is probably the

59
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,299
most interesting games in this category

60
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,740
too I've only probably put ten hours in

61
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,079
a Rainbow six siege but they have all

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
kinds of different versions of the game

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,350
and they continue to to update it

64
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,310
there's all kinds of different classes

65
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,920
and stuff that you can do these are some

66
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,520
really good ongoing

67
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,130
my first instinct is to vote for

68
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,240
fortnight because it's one of the most

69
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
popular games and I feel like a lot of

70
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,160
people enjoy that game even though I

71
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,650
definitely do not um but I think there's

72
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,350
a pity vote here and I feel bad but my

73
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,200
pity vote goes for no man sky it's just

74
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,780
a it's a way of saying guys thank you

75
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,950
for continuing to develop this game even

76
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,630
though you messed it up to begin with

77
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,520
that's that's my vote it's the best game

78
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,830
direction awarded to a game study of for

79
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,150
outstanding creative vision and

80
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,770
innovation in game direction and design

81
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,830
a way out this is such an innovative

82
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,400
game

83
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,260
I watched it get played I did not have a

84
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,600
constant player player to really to sit

85
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,760
down and play this with so I just

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,980
watched to get played which i think is a

87
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,950
good experience and Detroit become human

88
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,900
well the game direction there was quite

89
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,180
impressive awarded to a game city for a

90
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,330
standing creative vision and innovation

91
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,100
see the most innovative game is easily a

92
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,350
way out here Detroit become human was

93
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,120
more of the same of the formula that

94
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,350
those guys do God of War again Wow okay

95
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,850
they really need to revamp Reynoso

96
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,340
really did make him more vulnerable

97
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,570
relatable and interesting characters so

98
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,610
it this is one of my favorite games of

99
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,530
the year

100
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,540
Marvel's spider-man I love spider-man I

101
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,579
love Marvel I love the Marvel formula

102
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,920
but this game is very formulaic it

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,510
definitely follows the Marvel formula

104
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,340
right so there's not much innovation

105
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,480
there Red Dead Redemption 2 is the

106
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,680
incredible game don't give me don't get

107
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,209
mad at me when I say this but it

108
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,070
definitely follows the Rockstar formula

109
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,560
there's not much innovation here so what

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,290
is innovative here we're going for a

111
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,290
creative vision and innovation all of

112
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,760
these games are very very good but the

113
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,430
most innovative the most creative is

114
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,100
certainly a forced to player experience

115
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,750
now the problem is I didn't play through

116
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,769
this game myself I watched it get played

117
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,000
so it's difficult to vote for I played

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,470
for every other game on this list

119
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,650
mm-hmm I'm voting for a way out I think

120
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,890
I think because it's such a unique

121
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,310
experience I feel like it deserves it I

122
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,080
really do so the way of best narrative

123
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,430
for outstanding storytelling and

124
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,770
narrative development and a game well

125
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,090
obviously Detroit become here

126
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,310
is an interactive story it's an

127
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,810
interactive movie so that might very

128
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,169
well be the obvious choice god of war an

129
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,910
incredible story and a career incredible

130
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,620
narrative incredible voice acting

131
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,060
incredible everything is everything is

132
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,080
right about this game

133
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,550
everything is just perfect about this

134
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,600
cave so it's again well let's see life

135
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,330
is strange - episode 1 I did not enjoy

136
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,460
the first life of strange I don't really

137
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,680
enjoy those Story type games I didn't

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,350
even really enjoy detroit as much as I

139
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,770
would a normal game so mmm I didn't care

140
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,030
much for a life story I have not played

141
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,950
the second one Marvel's spider-man of

142
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,900
course very good story but again like we

143
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,790
said earlier it's pretty it's pretty cut

144
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,530
and paste you know and then Red Dead

145
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,910
Redemption - mmm what an incredible

146
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,560
story line up to the point that I played

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
I have not completed Red Dead Redemption

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,710
- at this time I'm probably 60% through

149
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,050
man I think of all the stories that I

150
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,270
really this is obviously the obvious

151
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,250
choice here because it's got even a God

152
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,200
of War it really took the whole Kratos

153
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,030
formula and turned it on its head and

154
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,310
traded this vulnerable interesting

155
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,780
character out of this you know

156
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,000
overpowered sex God

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,349
ooh in spider-man man this is one of my

158
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,090
favorite spider-man tellings of all time

159
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,520
so it's very tempting it's very tempting

160
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,250
to vote for spider-man here as well mmm

161
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,190
but again if we're really picking the

162
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,169
one that stood out the most not the most

163
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,520
popular or not my favorite the one that

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,570
stood out the most I think Detroit

165
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,270
become human did did something that none

166
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,800
of those other games did so I think that

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,710
might be the right choice there best art

168
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,150
direction for outstanding creative

169
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,919
and/or technical achievements in

170
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,470
artistic design and animation which had

171
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,510
the best art Assassin's Creed honestly I

172
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,070
have not played through this yet have

173
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,229
seen it get played probably watch 2 or 3

174
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,060
hours of people streaming it very

175
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,910
beautiful game very formulaic god of war

176
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,070
boy I mean even if you just look at the

177
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,190
art here the shot it really does show

178
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,130
you what an incredibly beautiful game it

179
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,830
is for how bizarre how buzzes I have a

180
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,910
love affair with this game sigh

181
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,590
apologize those of you who hate on this

182
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,909
game for some reason you're going to

183
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,070
hate this video I think but octopus

184
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,870
traveler now you want to talk about

185
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,610
in art direction they did something no

186
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,620
one else has ever done they did that 3d

187
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,770
8-bit sprite thing that is unique that

188
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,280
is different that is but that's for

189
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,380
outstanding creative and/or technical

190
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,880
achievement is that a technical

191
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,010
achievement what they did know is it is

192
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,720
creative though it's absolutely creative

193
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,010
what they did knock a class traveler not

194
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,530
red dead redemption - is almost

195
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,640
photorealistic sometimes it's it's the

196
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,440
pinnacle it looks like a next-gen game

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,540
on this generation it really does it

198
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,970
looks like a high-end PC game on my xbox

199
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,470
1x so native 4k I just it looks so good

200
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,600
I don't know man and then return of the

201
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,240
O burden I know nothing about this game

202
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,220
I did not know this game existed until I

203
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,870
saw this today have you played this let

204
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,390
me know if you have I think I'm Ivette

205
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,550
travel here is definitely an option I

206
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,020
think God of War is definitely an option

207
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,960
here as well because wow I mean the

208
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,140
dragons the bosses the the monsters they

209
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,290
really really did get creative and again

210
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,010
it looks almost photorealistic in points

211
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,310
rented or dimension to again but I keep

212
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,960
coming back to octopus traveler because

213
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,170
if it's about creativity I would have

214
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,490
saved maybe octopus travel or whatever

215
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,760
the heck this is return of o bird in one

216
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,620
of those games might be the right choice

217
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,920
I think I'm gonna give it to octopus

218
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,870
traveler I don't think octave has

219
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,310
travellers gonna win anything else this

220
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,260
is probably only real chance unless as

221
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,410
an RPG category I will give it to the

222
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,330
octopus traveler here because again it

223
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,680
was creative it was unique it was

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,770
different so Best Score / music

225
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,080
presented by Spotify / thanks Spotify

226
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,440
for presenting this category I guess a

227
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,210
commercialization you know I always get

228
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,740
on Jeff Keely about that about the game

229
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,330
of words but I know he's got at least

230
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,860
break even and hopefully he wants to

231
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,300
make a problem so Spotify is gonna

232
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,910
support him I think that's fine

233
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,520
Celeste what a beautiful soundtrack what

234
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,530
a wonderful game I'm so surprised at how

235
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,300
great that game is I'm so glad to see it

236
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,310
get the love it's getting this year God

237
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,750
of War the soundtrack to God of War is

238
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,020
incredible oh my god oh it's just so

239
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,570
good it's a score and music we're only

240
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,310
talking about score in music

241
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,050
then we have marble spider-man which had

242
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,850
a very very good soundtrack as well I

243
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,470
was really surprised with that octave

244
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,300
that traveler has some incredible music

245
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,370
and a lot of music to each character

246
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,590
having its own dedicated music and

247
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,650
there's a so much music in it Red Dead

248
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,060
Redemption too has so much music and if

249
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,180
we're talking about score only yeah Red

250
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,100
Dead erections to score is very very

251
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,760
good the music the singing the the the

252
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,580
audio the the the the sea shanties is so

253
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,130
much music and Red Dead Redemption to

254
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,810
compared to these other games and it's

255
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,390
it's so incredible I'm sorry I will

256
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,620
easily give this on the Red Dead

257
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,110
Redemption - I have set around camp for

258
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,890
hours just listening to people sing

259
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,750
because I love that style of music we

260
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,490
have best audio design presented only a

261
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,710
dull we what's up call of duty black ops

262
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,290
4 I only really played the blackout mode

263
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,430
because there is no single player mode

264
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,810
so I don't know how you I don't know how

265
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,010
you could vote for that here right maybe

266
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,320
maybe I didn't wear headphones Forza

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,240
horizon for a lot of good music a lot of

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,410
good sounds in this one sounds like a

269
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,990
racing game god of war once again I mean

270
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,580
there's again a lot of innovation here

271
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
you got a lot of a lot of monster noises

272
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,870
a lot of voice acting got a lot of stuff

273
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,660
a lot of stuff you have to do there Red

274
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,339
Dead Redemption to again well I'm not

275
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,810
gonna vote for the same game twice in

276
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,920
two different categories like that I

277
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,510
think one right after the other both

278
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,500
related and sound so God of War would be

279
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,180
an obvious choice here because I mean

280
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,970
they did a lot Red Dead Redemption -

281
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,530
when it comes to sound I mean the number

282
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,700
of voice lines they recorded alone is

283
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,690
staggering and they recorded those voice

284
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,490
lines twice sometimes when you're close

285
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,839
and sometimes four you're far away they

286
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,120
sound different they did the same thing

287
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
in Marvel's spider-man though some are

288
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,580
low spider-man and the sound in the

289
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,930
soundtrack everything in marble

290
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,670
Spiderman was good the acting the voice

291
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,709
acting everything the sounds of the

292
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,890
sittin all of these deserve it this is a

293
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,570
tough choice except maybe call a duty

294
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,430
black ops I'd never think of sounded I'm

295
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,170
playing Call of Duty I'm probably

296
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,070
spending too much time under this

297
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,240
category I'm gonna give it to spider-man

298
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,459
I really feel like they they were they

299
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,160
were really really really decent when it

300
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,260
came to the entire soundtrack for a

301
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
spider-man but most notably Red Dead

302
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,740
Redemption maybe deserved it there but I

303
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,870
want to spread all my votes

304
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,950
let's spread out to love a little bit

305
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,690
best performance awarded to an

306
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,310
individual for voice acting motion

307
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,020
and/or performance capture this is an

308
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,760
interesting category we have Brian

309
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,100
Descartes as Conner and Detroit become

310
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,350
human I mean Connor became a meme for a

311
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,800
while

312
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,670
Connor became a meme because of what how

313
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,810
incredible of a job he did in Detroit

314
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,240
the way of Christopher judge as Kratos

315
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,200
God of War oh my gosh he was incredible

316
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,950
oh what an incredible job that he did

317
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,250
Melissa santhi Mahuta as Cassandra in

318
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,230
Assassin's Creed I obviously know too

319
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,820
much about that game Roger Clark as

320
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,770
Arthur Morgan and Red Dead Redemption -

321
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,930
what an incredible job and what an

322
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,120
incredible voice actor what an

323
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,250
incredible job he did as Arthur Morgan I

324
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,220
did not think I would enjoy Arthur as a

325
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,420
character as much as I do

326
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,100
currently I don't know if I will feel

327
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,630
differently about him as it continues

328
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,310
and then we have hearing Lowenthal as

329
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,270
Peter Parker in Marvel's spider-man

330
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,060
again wonderful game and wonderful voice

331
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,920
acting here I Yuri you did a wonderful

332
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,860
job but Arthur Morgan is such a better

333
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,750
character Kratos is such a better

334
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,850
character I don't know why you wouldn't

335
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,320
give it to Connor here that I don't know

336
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
that I don't know that Brian did a

337
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,380
better job than others but he became oh

338
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,060
mmm famous for the incredible job he did

339
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,890
of course so did Chris or judge boy Oh

340
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,970
Christopher judge I'm giving it to you

341
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,890
man I'm yeah I feel like it should have

342
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,420
been Connor maybe it was a toss-up

343
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,680
between those two they both did an

344
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,720
incredible job we have the games impact

345
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,100
category for a thought-provoking game of

346
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,839
the profound pro-social meaning or

347
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,570
message so have 11/11 memories retold no

348
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,910
clue what this game is didn't play it

349
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,529
Celeste I don't even really think of

350
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,640
this as a game for impact

351
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,260
it just was a really good game I don't

352
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,970
hmm interesting

353
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,860
we have Florence which I've heard a lot

354
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,589
about I've seen a little bit get played

355
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,450
and I'm aware of it this game I think if

356
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,910
you suffer from depression I think this

357
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,140
is a game you might want to look at I

358
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,330
need to play it and it probably would

359
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,620
play for the end of the year before the

360
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,790
end of the year life is strange -

361
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,680
episode 1 nope skipped it and then the

362
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,959
missing JJ massif ID and the island of

363
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,270
Memories I know so little of these games

364
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,980
so if it's a game for impact that did

365
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,630
not make a big impact the only game on

366
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,540
this list that I played was Celeste so

367
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,339
I'm glad to vote for it here very good

368
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,130
very good game I gotta lie it's a really

369
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,690
good plan

370
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,490
then we have the best indie game and we

371
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,130
have Celeste here again which boy they

372
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,990
have a love affair with this game dead

373
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,030
cells wow you want to talk about a good

374
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,770
indie game and it just got a nice big

375
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,270
content patch to which I'm looking

376
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,860
forward to messin wet around with that

377
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,180
cells got his first big content patch

378
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,680
available in every platform is such a

379
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,540
good game a lot of people said about

380
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,860
this game buggy you would not have been

381
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,940
aware of this game we're not for that

382
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,950
controversy about the reviews you are

383
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,780
probably correct thank gosh for that

384
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,490
controversy because I played the hell

385
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,260
out of that game we have into the breach

386
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,450
which I finally got my Nintendo switch

387
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,310
even though I was very popular on iOS

388
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,950
and elsewhere I couldn't get into it I

389
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,310
it's a it's a fun rogue light experience

390
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,550
still I couldn't get into it return of

391
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,290
the open den again I need to play that

392
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,210
apparently and then the messenger oh my

393
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,420
god the messenger is so good its tongue

394
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,970
in cheek and goofy and silly and it's

395
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,160
got that ninja gaiden play style and

396
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,410
then it's like a love affair to these

397
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,700
old 8-bit it's so good it is it's I I

398
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,530
feed if you skip this game this year I

399
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,910
highly recommend this I played it on the

400
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,950
switch and I loved it there so if I had

401
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,560
to pick though between dead cells and

402
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,690
the messenger I'm gonna give it the dead

403
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,940
cells I really feel like the messenger

404
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,820
doesn't but the messenger is a overall

405
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,840
better game in a lot of ways hmm this is

406
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,350
difficult

407
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,720
I really enjoyed dead cells I played a

408
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,160
lot of dead cells I didn't beat it a

409
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,560
second time I only beat it once and then

410
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,210
on my second playthrough I just found a

411
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,700
little too difficult and frustrating I

412
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,220
played all the way through the messenger

413
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm gonna give it to the messenger

414
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,750
I'm sorry dead cells the message is very

415
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,810
very good we have best mobile game donut

416
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,030
country I saw I get played did not play

417
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,950
it Florence I saw it get played didn't

418
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,450
play at fortnight I have not played on

419
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,550
mobile pub G I have not played on mobile

420
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,940
and reigns Game of Thrones I did not

421
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,250
mess with well I feel like sometimes

422
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,650
when we have an opportunity to vote but

423
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,360
we don't know enough about the issues we

424
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,190
don't know enough about the games we

425
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,240
don't know enough about the thing we

426
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,830
should skip a category so I think we're

427
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,150
skipping this one because I really I

428
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,150
don't know then we have best VR /ar game

429
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,110
as much as I am crazy about VR or AR

430
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,480
augmented reality I will tell you I only

431
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,660
played a handful of

432
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,970
bvr games this year now I did play beat

433
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,680
saver and this is one of the best ones

434
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,230
to play it is as far as rhythm games go

435
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,360
it finally makes me feel like a Jedi I

436
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,110
really enjoyed it

437
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,670
I do not know what Astro botton mission

438
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,960
rescue mission is I do not know anything

439
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
about firewalls zero-hour moss was

440
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,240
incredible what an incredible puzzle

441
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,630
platformer VR game Wow that so glad to

442
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,830
see it here and then we have Tetris

443
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,380
effect which I know nothing about but I

444
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,090
want to try it now that I know that

445
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,940
exists I think Moss is a slam-dunk here

446
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,480
as much as beat saber is popular and fun

447
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,040
I think Moss is the better game between

448
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,630
the two I will also say the folks over

449
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,150
there at Moss do like me quite a bit so

450
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,200
there's a bit of conflict of interest

451
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,810
there I do like the folks at Moss and

452
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,150
they do like me quite a bit so best

453
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,710
action game for the best game in the

454
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,630
action genre focused on combat we have

455
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,120
call of duty black ops 4 we have dead

456
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,520
cells we have destiny 2 forsaken we have

457
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,270
Far Cry 5 and Megaman 11 so surprised to

458
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,700
see Far Cry 5 did not get much love of

459
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,740
course it is just more of the same call

460
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,480
of duty black ops 4 is more of the same

461
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,490
dead cells is an incredible action game

462
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,070
destiny 2 is more of the same Megaman 11

463
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,990
is mostly more of the same this is where

464
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,880
I'll gladly vote for dead cells as far

465
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,530
as action games go it is some of the

466
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,490
best castlevania metroid style gameplay

467
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,650
I've felt in a long time everything felt

468
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,420
interesting and innovative and deep and

469
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,060
fun and I loved it we have best action

470
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,710
adventure game for the best action of

471
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,110
intra combining combat with traversal

472
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,329
and puzzle solving Sasson Street Odyssey

473
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,760
God of War marvel's and spider-man Red

474
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,500
Dead Redemption - and shadow of the Tomb

475
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,660
Raider I still need to play shadow of

476
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,980
the Tomb Raider I don't know why that

477
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,630
flew under my radar Red Dead Redemption

478
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,180
- is an amazing action game I don't know

479
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,770
if we're caring too much about puzzles

480
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,939
there's not a lot of puzzles there

481
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,949
Marvel's spider-man does have puzzles

482
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,839
not that interesting of a puzzles

483
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,630
situation especially the science

484
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,130
experiment stuff God of War is got a

485
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,720
tremendous amount of puzzles in an

486
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,070
assassin's creed honestly I don't know

487
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,780
enough to vote so it God of War is an

488
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,230
easy choice here the puzzles in war are

489
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,520
not frustrating and annoying like some

490
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,960
of the original puzzles they're almost

491
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,900
always easy to figure out but they still

492
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,340
change the pacing and make the game a

493
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,120
little more fun

494
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,800
by being in there we got best

495
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,930
role-playing game Dragon Quest 11 which

496
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,490
I have currently skipped we have monster

497
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,500
hunter world which was deep and

498
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,960
incredible and grindy ninokuni to which

499
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,030
I dabbled with I did enjoy quite a bit

500
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,710
octopus traveler and pillars of eternity

501
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,690
to which I also skipped I still need to

502
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,280
get caught up on this so easy vote here

503
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,900
octopus robber if you didn't play it you

504
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,550
should if you own a switch you really

505
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,800
should play it we get a best fighting

506
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,150
game BlazBlue Dragon Ball Z so caliber 6

507
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,280
Street Fighter 5 arcade edition mmm no

508
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,140
so caliber 6 I bought and only played

509
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,030
like 2 hours of I just haven't really

510
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,260
been able to get into Dragon Ball the

511
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,710
fighters fighters our fighter Z fighters

512
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,750
is rare very good though both both of

513
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,490
these games are very good I think I'm

514
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,290
more of a Soul Calibur fan than I am hey

515
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,760
Dragon Ball fan though so that seems

516
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,690
like an easy choice

517
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,910
best family game we have Mario Tennis

518
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,220
Aces which I despised we have a Nintendo

519
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,690
logo which I hated

520
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,190
we have overcooked to which I played

521
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,090
tried a bit with a Jessie and swift when

522
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,440
they were here we have star link which I

523
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,450
skipped entirely and Super Mario Party

524
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,250
which I played a tremendous amount of

525
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,530
some Super Mario Party was incredible if

526
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,150
I felt people would watch me stream that

527
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,160
game I would've streamed it that said

528
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,410
overcooked 2 is innovative it is

529
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,150
interesting it is cool and it is

530
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,220
family-friendly and this frustrating and

531
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,559
Swift is terrible demanded Jesse is

532
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,300
incredible at it though so that was that

533
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,440
was probably one of my favorite

534
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,210
experiences this year playing overcooked

535
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,250
and overcooked 2 with mcjuggernuggets

536
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,320
and this came around that strategy game

537
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,630
best game focused on real time or

538
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,770
turn-based strategy gameplay

539
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,179
irrespective a platform we have the

540
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,300
Banner Saga 3 we have a battle tech we

541
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
have a frost Punk we have end of the

542
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,420
breach and we have Valkyrie Chronicles I

543
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,710
think we're gonna abstain because I

544
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,990
don't know enough about these categories

545
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,150
I don't know if about these games so

546
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,710
we'll skip that best sports and racing

547
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,020
game now you know me I don't mess with

548
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,330
sports games I do mess with racing games

549
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,280
though so we have FIFA 19 which I will

550
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,470
never play fort so horizon 4 which was

551
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,880
incredible and I played tremendously

552
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,710
Mario Tennis Aces which I did not like

553
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,950
NBA 2019 I did not like a Pro Evolution

554
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,410
Soccer easy choice here for me Forza

555
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,840
horizon for I just now started playing

556
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
it because I was very busy when that

557
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,929
game dropped I do highly recommend it

558
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,600
with a best multiplayer game call of

559
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,559
duty black ops 4 we

560
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,690
Destinee - we have fortnight monster

561
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,549
hunter world and see a thieves I mean as

562
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,799
popular as fortnight is and it is very

563
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,789
very good

564
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,740
monster hunter world which does not

565
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,840
appeal to me is easily the best

566
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,350
technically interesting multiplayer game

567
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,299
I mean as soon as they started dropping

568
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,649
you know multiplayer of the game changed

569
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,370
entirely

570
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm glad fallout 76 is not on this list

571
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,649
easily give it to monster hunter world I

572
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,929
think as much as that game did not

573
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,710
appeal to me um it was still very fun to

574
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,509
play and I know a lot of people enjoyed

575
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,980
it best student game I think we're gonna

576
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,899
skip that category Best Debut indie game

577
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,789
we're gonna skip this category best

578
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:37,619
eSports game I'm definitely going to

579
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,499
skip that category best eSports moment

580
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:43,679
or player nope best eSports team so much

581
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,330
eSports stuff this year and I know

582
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,759
nothing about eSports so I'm going to

583
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,149
gladly easily skip this stuff look at

584
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,190
this best eSport moment alright here's

585
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,779
an important category we have content

586
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,090
creator of the year we have dr. Lupo I

587
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,809
don't know who that is myth I do not

588
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,789
know who that is ninja who I have no I

589
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:04,860
know and I have met we have pokey man

590
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,480
who went viral because she didn't wear

591
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,149
makeup once and then we have Willy Rex

592
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,490
I'm sorry that I don't know very many of

593
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,909
these creators I I don't know these

594
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:17,519
creators but I do know ninja I mean he's

595
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,249
been on CNN he is a household name and I

596
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:22,799
like that he's relatively clean and safe

597
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,990
and doesn't make too many mistakes so I

598
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,119
will gladly vote for ninja no poke you

599
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,499
mean this thing's pretty cool too I

600
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,059
think she's probably pretty great

601
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,039
alright then finally this is the one

602
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,210
you've all been waiting for we have the

603
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,659
game of the year and I've thought about

604
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,610
it this entire time assassin's creed

605
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,009
Odyssey I don't see how that could win

606
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,110
game of the year Celeste I know it's

607
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,669
controversial that people have put this

608
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,029
on the list I do not disagree that it's

609
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:49,769
controversial but I do agree that it

610
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,049
belongs here because it is a very very

611
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,480
good platformer and I'm glad I think if

612
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,860
you skipped it you really should go back

613
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,909
and play it if you like those kinds of

614
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:59,820
platformers God of War Marvel's

615
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,159
spider-man Monster Hunter World or Red

616
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,899
Dead Redemption - and I think the

617
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,549
obvious choice for me here is either

618
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,440
going to be a Red Dead Redemption - or

619
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,169
god of war now this does not reflect on

620
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,070
what will be

621
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,660
my game of the year for my game of the

622
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,450
year list the top 15 top 10 games that I

623
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,160
play this year which I'll make probably

624
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,550
at the end of December this will not

625
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,590
necessarily reflect that I will tell you

626
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,660
that I have an emotional love affair

627
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,870
with God of War that game is innovative

628
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,820
and interesting but more importantly to

629
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,780
me I think was tough of years I had this

630
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,120
year God of War was the first game I

631
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,610
really truly enjoyed after all the the

632
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,110
stuff with the surgery and all the other

633
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,220
miserable stuff I went through in the

634
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,540
last year so I probably biased here but

635
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,250
this isn't my game of the year list this

636
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,810
is who I think is going to win and who I

637
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,460
want to cast my vote for and to be

638
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,140
honest with you I think I'm glad to give

639
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,760
it to Red Dead Redemption to here as

640
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,840
well because I know that it's probably

641
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,140
technically a bigger game a lot more

642
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,100
content a lot more bang for the buck and

643
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,870
it's certainly going to be the game that

644
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,150
people remember this year from here's

645
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,890
the thing even though PC players can't

646
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,380
play Red Dead Redemption to both Xbox

647
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,320
and Playstation players can only

648
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,860
PlayStation players can play God of War

649
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,270
so we'll see what we're going to do when

650
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,460
it comes time to my personal list but

651
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,610
here I think we give it to Red Dead

652
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,040

what they're doing over there and I

673
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,500
really admire the game Awards because I

674
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,390
think I think we need that in our

675
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,890
industry and I'm glad that they do it

676
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,690
and I hope that the game Awards is

677
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,860
better than it was the last couple years

678
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,050
this last year each year he seems to

679
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,370
improve and I hope it's even better this
