honest what was the like when you made

33
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,760
the connection like for you what was the

34
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,019
moment when you were reading the book

35
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,760
and say hey I'm gonna make this a movie

36
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,549
turn expose her first reaction when you

37
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,100
got a call and it's like hey this is

38
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,819
Steven Spielberg's people

39
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,180
but well thank you numbers work at the

40
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,009
book I read the script I heard his crime

41
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,449
furnace did an adaptation of the book

42
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,639
and was that pens and that was the first

43
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,949
thing I ever read but when I read the

44
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,430
book the scene that made me say

45
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,889
completely yes to the film was a

46
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,310
four-page dialogue scene between parson

47
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,039
or artist if so most they ever talk to

48
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:54,349
the book together and I said if I can

49
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,659
capture that in a bottle if I can get

50
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,050
that and reduce it to a movie point

51
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,139
because that relationship between parts

52
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,090
of our lives this will be able to be

53
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,710
worth maybe because this is a character

54
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,819
would be as well as a big action movie

55
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,969
well you know what they told me that the

56
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:18,080
Steven was going to read the screenplay

57
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:34,100
I got really depressed to do it

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,870
very hectic the longest couple weeks of

59
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,200
my life

60
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
 you mr. signing why are you

61
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,960
watching all of his movies and listening

62
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,890
to John Williams non-stop and then

63
00:05:44,890 --> 00:06:12,530
[Music]

64
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,950
wonderful to be in an audience that when

65
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,890
the phone stops we all cheer along with

66
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,500
music comes back because we have we have

67
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,080
the joy of the collaborative that we

68
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,860
have playgrounds kids the one where

69
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,630
they're throwing imaginary things to

70
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,240
each other when they're in the van

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,190
immediately conduct that so my question

72
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,310
to each other is is there a favorite toy

73
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,090
was use of the toilet to the mecha

74
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,980
godzilla something in particular that

75
00:06:43,980 --> 00:07:02,010
really just taken one so the night cycle

76
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,070
to use biggest scare me as a way

77
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:19,500
I call cgk as well especially a bit

78
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,360
where we were talking about the power

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,550
wind approaching choking the bags before

80
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:44,160
we get on the one thing that none of you

81
00:07:44,160 --> 00:08:01,320
should talk about the shining possible

82
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,940
glory you know that's something I made

83
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,710
it all the way from the book it's my

84
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,420
real life and then into the movie so

85
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,060
that's my favorite and today we be able

86
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,350
to bring the Iron Giant

87
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,150
[Music]

88
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:50,620
I was wondering what the process was

89
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,540
when directing him on this movie well I

90
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,280
know I'm great you know Margaret obvious

91
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,720
waitresses the third movie we made

92
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,200
together and and what really led me to

93
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,060
this decision to see if Mark would want

94
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,800
to do this is he such a mark has such he

95
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,960
has not lost his childhood you know

96
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,880
there's a little boy alive and thriving

97
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,850
in mark and and I just thought that

98
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,540
there was something both very very

99
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,400
connected with the world

100
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,950
and something also a little bit removed

101
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,250
a little bit serial about Mark and

102
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,850
that's the way they wrote Halliday and I

103
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,530
just remember saying you know to mark

104
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,930
and my approach to mothers I said I'd

105
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,160
love you to be at a movie in play two

106
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,870
roles he said oh I'd love to play two

107
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,820
roles in the film and I said we get to

108
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,160
play yourself and your avatar alter ego

109
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,650
and I remember before I even gave him

110
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,120
the script to read I talked into the

111
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,410
movie and before you live it read the

112
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:55,330
script he signed up to do it in time

113
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:20,080
[Music]

114
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,370
really

115
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,760
total team effort for three years on one

116
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
screenplay which the reason why so many

117
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,650
movies you see are so bad is because

118
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,410
directors don't take the writers who

119
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,900
they need and they like and keep them in

120
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,690
a team and that is not the way to David

121
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,930
Gilbert works he had an attorney all the

122
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,370
way through we worked with us together

123
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,200
the storyboard artists there's so many

124
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,640
people worked on this movie deserve

125
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,090
credit for it but this is like a key

126
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,970
study in working on a screenplay to the

127
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,760
maximum amount you can with everybody

128
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,980
bringing their expertise to the table so

129
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,910
that was the process it was kind of as I

130
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,590
say these heads there in the room above

131
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,330
the work you know Steven Spielberg all

132
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,090
over everything is works as it should be

133
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,170
and they're totally

134
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,890
[Laughter]

135
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,490
[Applause]

136
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,639
that he creates but where it's just you

137
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,500
see though you know when they're for the

138
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,389
first time you meet see then I think

139
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,490
everybody is there Dover thought their

140
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,329
wardrobe really so much that when you

141
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,730
get these centuries and immediately

142
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,720
starts to make you feel like a

143
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,209
collaborator and I felt you know I'm

144
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:44,509
such a fan of my work and invested in

145
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,949
making the best adaptation possible and

146
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,750
you know I have a bad experience with my

147
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,220
first movie I would have made two movies

148
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,230
and this is the kind of the worst

149
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,089
experience when you have the best

150
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,910
experience and so I'm so grateful to

151
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:09,089
everyone up here my wife was she was

152
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,870

154
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,029

155
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,209
gamings everybody be better life like I

156
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,500
said before you go home to play at the

157
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,569
DoD guitarists end of story but she

158
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:27,209
heard the entire book on tape and she

159
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,860
came back to me after three days as she

160
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,379
said I don't really decided to do it she

161
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:52,810

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,710
you know I never just did one thing at

170
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,020
the same time because I found when I had

171
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,240
multiple projects and I would get lost

172
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,000
in one I'd come back to the other one

173
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,810
complete clarity and my objectivity is

174
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,089
the thing that I fear the most

175
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,250
losing the second I become too

176
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,200
subjective about something and I get to

177
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
inside of the story I can't see anymore

178
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,970
I can't see you from the audience's

179
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,500
point of view anymore so by doing

180
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,810
several things at the same time I get to

181
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,010
have a renewal of objectivity and and

182
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,050
the post was a special situation but I

183
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,390
thought the job was was to the same

184
00:13:52,390 --> 00:14:01,730
you know

185
00:14:01,730 --> 00:15:00,019
was further back and then season came on

186
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,029
board Zack called me and told me about

187
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,589
this first meeting with Siva came in

188
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,480
with like 50 some posted notes in the

189
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,579
novel of things you want to put back

190
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,529
into the into the movie that had been

191
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,800
taken out and from and I haven't worried

192
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,040
single moments you know since then he

193
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,230
every all my favorites to film

194
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,110
applications like jaws have taken

195
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,000
liberties with the source material and

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,649
made drastic changes because you have to

197
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,819
either two different mediums of two

198
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,220
different needs and two different

199
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,079
strengths so I'm you always have to

200
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,149
rework things even even talking you know

201
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:50,020
and so I was a I was at home

202
00:15:50,020 --> 00:16:25,220
to do this we heard everyone's favorite

203
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,050
character since this is a movie about

204
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,750
Easter eggs there were a ton of them in

205
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,140
there

206
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,210
I think the audience notice different

207
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,220
ones not everyone noticed everything

208
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,260
what was your favorite little secret

209
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:47,180
throw in from

210
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:55,430
[Applause]

211
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:19,589
you know yeah there you go you in there

212
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,339
you know we have island doing the

213
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,140
special effects inside the Oasis and

214
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,870
then Digital Domain did the real world

215
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,510
special effects and both I think special

216
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,390
effects to you kid stuff my favorites

217
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,860
are the ones that we convinced even to

218
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,140
make rehearse our movies I love seeing

219
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:50,290
the t-rex

220
00:17:50,290 --> 00:18:02,150
that can be seen for someone that said

221
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,660
[Laughter]

222
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:11,980
[Music]

223
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,260
and I had a great team every single day

224
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,120
looking at the effects evolving over a

225
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,540
three-year period and we made seven

226
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,030
passes on one shot and it was the last

227
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,030
pass right through the final on fire

228
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:32,030
the camp is hard to go back after you

229
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:51,070
[Laughter]

230
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:58,090
[Applause]

231
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:30,229
[Applause]

232
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:33,629
okay welcome to the spoiler section I

233
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,789
promise you we haven't been wearing the

234
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,570
same clothes for a month and oh Jesus

235
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,399
actually I haven't watched this shirt in

236
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,429
little while so I need it no ah so yeah

237
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,669
so let's jump right into the spoiler I

238
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,899
guess I love the fact that you know

239
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,029
obviously because I'm developing the

240
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,769
Street Fighter miniatures game I love

241
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,469
that Street Fighter was involved the

242
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,960
main character even does a Hadouken to

243
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,739
defeat the the final boss I love The

244
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:06,719
Mortal Kombat was so involved we get to

245
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:10,769
see Goro we get to see alien yeah my

246
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,359
favorite film of all time

247
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,009
aliens there yeah yeah it chestburster

248
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,979
from Goro this is crazy we see a

249
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,409
reference to Star Trek from the creator

250
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:25,289
of this Oasis world which immediately in

251
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,599
dirt endeared me to the creator of the

252
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,519
world which we didn't really get much

253
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,859
into in fact in our review that that guy

254
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:34,710
was just a precious old man I just loved

255
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,450
that yeah yeah and the these Easter eggs

256
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,469
where I thought it was gonna be a

257
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:42,509
stupid-ass journey and turned out to be

258
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,599
fascinating mysteries what was the first

259
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,080
one the race rise when it goes backwards

260
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,450
I mean like that that's that's

261
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,460
absolutely not in the book at all Oh

262
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,099
another thing about a race and like the

263
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,739
the contest is wildly different none of

264
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:00,210
those characters know each other like

265
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,399
agh knows each other I rock is actually

266
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,080
a friend of the Bears at the beginning

267
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,059
and that's why who's I wrong the devil

268
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,769
down guy yeah and so like thought so

269
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,179
excessive this whole betrayal thing like

270
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,009
this is wildly different from the very

271
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,859
very yeah but I kept expecting IROC to

272
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:16,409
switch sides but he didn't really no not

273
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,580
at all yes bad so the the second journey

274
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,570
for the second key was the one of the

275
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,009
great what we couldn't tell you before

276
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,429
they go into the movie The Shining like

277
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:31,830
the audience erupted and I just one of

278
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,149
my favorite horror films and

279
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:35,669
I found it really great and they pay it

280
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,070
so much respect they make it just as

281
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,019
creepy as original sometimes even

282
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,469
creepier where the naked lady turns into

283
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,159
a road-test demonic zombie and

284
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,719
she's going crazy while the lights are

285
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:50,759
flickering and I'm like wow this film

286
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,659
has some darker sides to it you know so

287
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,450
I was like well done well done

288
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,940
now I'm glad they didn't whip out like a

289
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,899
 you know Jack Nicholson CGI so

290
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,849
happy they stayed away from that well

291
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,739
you never really see him you see him but

292
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:10,289
you only see parts of it like and the

293
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,320
person matter the axe is menacing boot

294
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,899
and foot in the snow stuff like that so

295
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,200
oh oh great and then the final challenge

296
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,019
was playing all these Atari video games

297
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,029
and he couldn't really figure out how to

298
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:27,179
beat it yeah and it turned out to be a

299
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,309
reference to the first Easter Egg ever

300
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:32,009
in video games which was an Atari game

301
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:33,869
called like a venturous event and

302
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:37,139
adventures where the Easter Egg was just

303
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,359
enjoying playing it wasn't about beating

304
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,649
the game it was just going around

305
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,080
searching and exploring everything until

306
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,029
you found just this random thing and we

307
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,589
take the random thing back to the

308
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:48,719
beginning then you see the creative

309
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,059
directors name and the designers name

310
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,759
and in unlock the actually Easter Egg

311
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,909
for the whole business so yeah fantastic

312
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:02,460
concept executed really really well let

313
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,879
me pause here and I'm going to go and

314
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:07,830
tack on some some other things to the

315
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,200
review you know and another thing just

316
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,229
to talk about if I can use it in

317
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:15,629
character what I'm gonna and another

318
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:17,339
thing okay before we go to the spoiler

319
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:18,989
section there was I was talking in the

320
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:20,219
source age and I was like you know what

321
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:22,559
we kind of missed some of this and no

322
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,349
spoilers but I I did want to talk a

323
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:28,710
little bit about how the creator of the

324
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,239
of the Oasis just this this precious old

325
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,519
man and I totally fell in love with this

326
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,710
character and you this eccentric

327
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,779
attitude you like yeah okay

328
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,750
I know people like that and

329
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,700
and you just loved him so every time he

330
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,470
was on the screen you were just

331
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,200
enthralled by his prepares you like that

332
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,130
oh yeah

333
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,990
he actually reminds me of Steve Jackson

334
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,210
a whole lot actually I've met Steve

335
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,520
Jackson and I didn't know that it was

336
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,390
him at first she was like hey if y'all

337
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,800
know Steve Jackson Steve Jackson games

338
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,530
from another Austin Texas yeah exactly

339
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,630
makes a lot of board games he is a

340
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,970
little awkward but he seemed exactly

341
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,520
like this guy wears like socially that

342
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,220
brain in there just pick at it a little

343
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,400
bit come on I loved it really really

344
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,780
cool and then some messages of how you

345
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,520
working together and I think it's a

346
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,740
really good message it doesn't matter

347
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,020
what you look like on the outside in the

348
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,770
real world you can form friendships

349
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,840
through the internet just as strongly as

350
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,260
you can in the real world and and then

351
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,330
they also managed I didn't expect this

352
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,920
and I didn't even think about it but I'm

353
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,890
like I'm glad they did it that they they

354
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,470
tie in to how it's also not a good idea

355
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,140
to always be vehicles do be immersed

356
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,120
yeah you know you have to engage with

357
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,050
the real world

358
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,610
and so I'm glad that they stuck that

359
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,640
message in so just and another thing is

360
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,010
what I wanted to say is that we had

361
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,310
great supporting cast and a great

362
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,850
message overall for gamers and for

363
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,510
regular moviegoers okay that's it this

364
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,960
is the real end back to the spoilers

365
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,030
okay so go ahead somebody bring up the

366
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,940
next boiler what do you guys think no

367
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,970
Erica gremlins okay so this is the part

368
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,890
where you know Spielberg is going

369
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,480
through the final cutscenes for some of

370
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,050
these and there's so much in these like

371
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,210
in this movie and everywhere that he

372
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,830
didn't even notice that they had snuck

373
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,590
Kremlin's and until he was approving the

374
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,750
final cutscene goes hey wait a second

375
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,360
there were multiple times with a romans

376
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,400
references where we see the the box that

377
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,110
the Mogwai comes in there's gremlins um

378
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,360
oh there's like other things when there

379
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,370
was technical difficulties like actual

380
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,290
in the theaters like is this

381
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,790
now that one of them to month outta me

382
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,220
here if they ground the film to a halt

383
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,920
so as we watch the film there was

384
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,980
technical difficulties and during the

385
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,700
climax the sound cut out when the orb

386
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,290
exploded with power and at first I

387
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,700
thought it was like oh they're doing the

388
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,070
Star Wars thing because he was so

389
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,740
powerful that it's but it actually blew

390
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,550
the speaker and then there was no

391
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,680
sounding you could clearly tell oh and

392
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,080
they're charging nothing was going on

393
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,540
they stopped the film five ten minutes

394
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,310
later they restarted they go through

395
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,590
that same sequence and again that sound

396
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,830
cuts out but finally they did it a third

397
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,470
time and I actually think it's actually

398
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,220
awesome that this happened because since

399
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,960
the audience audience was so hyped up

400
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,790
first time the second time it happened

401
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,180
we were providing the laser effects as

402
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,430
they were firing as the two forces were

403
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,680
converging but that third time when the

404
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,290
sound finally kicked in everybody was so

405
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,730
happy that they could is the thing

406
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,450
corrupted on a USB Drive but so when you

407
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,310
know he raises his hand and then

408
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,920
everybody charges the audience I don't

409
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,080
know maybe I started or something I was

410
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,080
just screwed oh my god and the whole

411
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,940
audience scream so is like we were

412
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,880
running down the mountain to very

413
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,430
natural for us to just holler at this it

414
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,190
was it was amazing so that was a

415
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,650
really great experience it probably

416
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,300
heightened our reigning him what was

417
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,980
nice about it is we got to watch the

418
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,770
same 5 second like intro to the battle

419
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,330
over and over every single time i watch

420
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,430
the same screen i saw new character it's

421
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,260
like yes fun there's a joker that's

422
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,270
definitely he-man there's a little Hello

423
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,580
Kitty there's a he'll definitely

424
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,260
Battletoads there's a whole charm

425
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,540
everyone from halo everyone and all I

426
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,630
loved that that part so more Easter egg

427
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,070
talk now they got all the references

428
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,540
amazing you tell that there they're big

429
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,250
fans of Gundam if you're a big fan of

430
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,950
Gundam you'll love this you saw that in

431
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,630
the trailer a little bit but that's only

432
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,040
a tease it's great but they made two

433
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,610
mistakes okay if you want to get it

434
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,059
Ashley so I'm gonna pull out my actually

435
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,850
so I mean you know for aliens is my

436
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,730
favorite fellow and they she pulls out a

437
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,490
pulse rifle during the climax and I'm

438
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,480
like oh yes I can't wait to hear the

439
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,330
iconic pulse rifle sound then instead

440
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,530
it's 50/50 now the gun sounded fantastic

441
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,450
sounded amazing and it may have sounded

442
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,580
like that in some of the video games but

443
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,790
it's actually not the way pulse rifles

444
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,429
should sound it lacked a little bit of

445
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,220
that reverb echo that happens right

446
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,020
after you release the trigger there's

447
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,080
this iconic sound that was missing and I

448
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,630
hope they fixed that for the DVD because

449
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,860
that bothered me excuse me excuse me and

450
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,410
then also I think B Holy Hand Grenade

451
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,080
the entire point of the Holy Hand

452
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,110
Grenade a Monty Python was the fact that

453
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,809
it explodes you know at a very precise

454
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,630
count of a second but maybe that's why

455
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,160
they threw the joke out the window

456
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,090
because so I wanted to know I wanted to

457
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,980
count exactly how many seconds but I was

458
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,360
just sewing through all my area I wasn't

459
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,190
counting so somebody needs to see if the

460
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,320
Holy Hand Grenade was appropriate to

461
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,960
it's as film accurate lore did anybody

462
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,410
notice any other mistakes DeLorean was

463
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,220
fantastically recruited Oh

464
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,590
Mechagodzilla I have not seen that

465
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,440
design of Mechagodzilla perhaps this is

466
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,170
the design a discarded design from

467
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,030
Touhou or maybe we'll see this version

468
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,340
of Mechagodzilla in the future or the

469
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,620
animated Godzilla on Netflix highly

470
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,630
recommend you see it maybe part two is

471
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,540
is that Mechagodzilla or maybe I mean

472
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,300
there are 31 Godzilla films so maybe

473
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,179
maybe he is a design in there you're

474
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,280
gonna have to challenge me on that we're

475
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,510
gonna have to watch this a lot of times

476
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,010
because there's like MechWarrior things

477
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,679
and they were amazing

478
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,850
we're and not only met were there were

479
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,559
other robot designs where I'm like I've

480
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,140
recognized

481
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,210
but I can't tell what game that was from

482
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,090
so oh so many good thing there was

483
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,440
somebody needs to make a list there was

484
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,540
a really great use of the f-bomb

485
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,310
they got one and it was yeah they're

486
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,070
worse profanity in any way yeah and it

487
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,750
was multiple there was a there was

488
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,430
a yeah he's going out one f-word

489
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,280
yeah one one one

490
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,410
one yes but it will go ahead oh

491
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,930
well it's a spoiler saying yeah I mean

492
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,720
but I mean it's so good alright like

493
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,980
whoa watch the socket yeah like it uh it

494
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,830
was the casts favorite part of the when

495
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,390
they got ass afterwards like what's your

496
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,800
well I'm gonna show that y'all stop

497
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,570
spoiling that section so he can

498
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,370
be awesome and people can watch that for

499
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:06,250
the first time yeah I I knew it was

500
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,710
there because of the trailer but because

501
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,080
that film made me cry and you know why

502
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,330
it made me cry right not only was it an

503
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:21,430
amazing movie and you know how much the

504
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,030
ever had

505
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,940
what Iron Giant was thinking and feeling

506
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,460
as he heroically you know sacrificed

507
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,990
we're in the spoilers oh no the iron my

508
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,270
other favorite parts was the whole you

509
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,710
don't know who people are on the other

510
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,350
side of the screen and everything and as

511
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,970
somebody who had not actually read the

512
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,490
book I was not expecting his best friend

513
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,970
to be a chick and I love that yes it

514
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,150
could be some rated Judy Charles or sure

515
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,700
he totally subvert your expectations and

516
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,050
I thought they were gonna do some stupid

517
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,600
we're like oh she's a hot chick too and

518
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,160
it would be that should be a love

519
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,080
triangle and this and that but no she

520
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,240
looks nothing like you thinking what she

521
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,250
would and a lot of the characters in the

522
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,050
film you know they don't look like your

523
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,360
typical Hollywood you know friggin

524
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,060
hotties or whatever and and so it was a

525
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,480
diverse cast of characters though they

526
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,910
did kind of put but that's not it's not

527
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,610
racist to say well they gave the

528
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,370
Japanese guy all of sort of the Japanese

529
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,390
things where

530
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,090
he was really good at martial arts he

531
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,700
loved condoms but that's not racist and

532
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,900
I hope people don't point that all

533
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,660
whether you had to do that well yes

534
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,640
that's where that's where Gundam and

535
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,760
gunplay comes from Gunpla you know and

536
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,309
so don't be an idiot and you know say

537
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,190
stupid like mad so I thought it was

538
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,230
great you know culture is coming from I

539
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,540
don't know what the younger 11 year old

540
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,270
kid they kind of I mean he they were

541
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,090
they were so much like more part of the

542
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,010
story in the book yeah we're in the film

543
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,070
he was sidelined he literally was 11

544
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,730
years old

545
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,919
that was another small weak point of the

546
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,840
film that all of his jokes were I'm 11

547
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,350
years old

548
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,500
oh yeah get over it yeah and so but but

549
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,880
he had more to do in the book I Todd

550
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,250
they I think they're it's it's not that

551
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,960
it was that much of a problem but there

552
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,429
was they did a lot of cool in the

553
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:16,960
in the book yeah they did some really

554
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,390
cool stuff in the movie like really cool

555
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,460
stuff in the movie but you saw so little

556
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,200
of them that I wish you saw more yeah

557
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,090
and the reason why we're not telling you

558
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,429
exactly how the quests differentiate

559
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:29,200
from the book is because we want you to

560
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,970
read that audiobook or listen to the

561
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,710
audiobook because it's a good one and

562
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:41,110
and it's one of those books a lot of

563
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,429
people like ani went down it's like

564
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:43,480
you'll just sit there you know just like

565
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,070
thumb through keys oh it's a lot of

566
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,780
lists of TV shows from the 80s and

567
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,429
you're like I get it - I get it MacGyver

568
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:52,179
again a lot of the jokes worked the the

569
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:53,890
corporate asshole has his

570
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,960
password right there it's like what is

571
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,020
it boss man 69 you know and they use

572
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,090
that to sort of hack into his machine

573
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,860
and create a virtual reality I mean the

574
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,840
way the quest they went on here were

575
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,909
super clever I was like it's had to come

576
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,530
from the book because that's a clever

577
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,210
book idea but apparently none of those

578
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,879
quests were the same as the ones in the

579
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,010
book so I enjoyed it thought it was

580
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,480
quite good though

581
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,379
another sort of um excuse me excuse me

582
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:26,109
is what the is the police in this

583
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:28,330
goddamn world they show up right at the

584
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,300
end and you're like really really now

585
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,790
 the corporation's blowing

586
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,510
people's

587
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,179
trying to murder this kid and the police

588
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,190
didn't immediately get alerted okay we

589
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,379
need security on the winner right now

590
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,020
until he finishes his quest because I'm

591
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,579
sure the cops of the world would be fans

592
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:46,750
of the Oasis too

593
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,429
well they don't know who he is and they

594
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,980
oh it's what the corporation finds out

595
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,500
who he is yeah it was explained in the

596
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,480
book not other that's an excuse it's

597
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,679
like they're really dangerous it's

598
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,790
actually really really dangerous and

599
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,990
they blow up all the time because people

600
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,420
propane and so there's accidents in the

601
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,710
stacks all the time they did really good

602
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,839
I had a more of a job of kind of hiding

603
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,400
they they didn't they didn't discuss it

604
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,570
at all in the movie actually when I was

605
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,339
watching it it's like wow it would make

606
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,740
it you you would believe it more if

607
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,270
they're like hey look I can make you

608
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,810
disappear

609
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,160
and no one will ever miss you because

610
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,990
people and your neighborhood die all of

611
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,820
the time and the bad guy says that a

612
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,099
bunch of times yeah and and they might

613
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,450
have said it once but it didn't uh

614
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,210
resume quite okay well good that's one

615
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,160
of the other the weaker points you know

616
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,630
so that's why you could probably end up

617
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,579
at an eight or a nine but I think

618
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:33,460
overall because we've had such few great

619
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,980
video game films because the way the

620
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,540
pacing in the film in the entertainment

621
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,730
in it from Steven Spielberg I think

622
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,089
that's what elevates it to being like 9

623
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,130
listen like it's really it's really

624
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:53,770
great I was not expecting to you

625
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,200
honestly going in with like didn't read

626
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,990
it you know the trailer wasn't as good

627
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,270
and you actually get in you sit there in

628
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,890
the entire time they're just exceed it

629
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,460
on the screen like wait yeah and I was

630
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,780
ready to hate it too and it actually

631
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,210
turned us and if it could turn Alex and

632
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,690
me you know that's good sign of you know

633
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,990
relay no noses of additive I wanted to

634
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,730
play in this world though I know if they

635
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,319
made a video game version of this film

636
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,420
they'd it up ya know and it would

637
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,280
be a nightmare trying to get all those

638
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,449
you know movie licenses and video games

639
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:35,949
this is kind of the first time

640
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:39,579
besides our miniatures game that that

641
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:41,859
Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter are in

642
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:45,279
the same realm together or that

643
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:47,170
crossover a little bit now they don't

644
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,489
fight each other but that would have

645
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,979
been really cool but they're in the same

646
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:53,589
film and just love all the references to

647
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:56,380
Superman so yeah film after my heart

648
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,009
aliens

649
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,799
Superman Star Trek back to the future
