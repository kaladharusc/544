328
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,180
appreciate you but I'm trying to go for

329
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,000
like one day becoming the most sponsored

330
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,040
person on YouTube because you know

331
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,810
there's no way I can compete with Twitch

332
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,260
so yeah yeah yeah thank you guys I

333
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,530
appreciate you guys as always so what's

334
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,870
the what he said on my stream exactly

335
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,130
every single word except yeah you can

336
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,300
waste all your money on me I don't mind

337
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,230
that is true

338
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,790
didn't ya lose the cops that's next role

339
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,500
isn't it kind of weird because me and

340
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,800
means hi we're we're brought up I guess

341
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,110
on YouTube back when it was it was

342
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,970
almost like a sin it just to get

343
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,310
partnered on YouTube like if you were

344
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,020
considered even a partner on YouTube

345
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,830
back in the day when we were doing

346
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,420
YouTube in the in the runescape

347
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,730
community people would actually shame

348
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,680
you just because you partnered with you

349
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,510
to everybody was so mad when like you're

350
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,510
switching from runescape to minecraft so

351
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,800
now like the whole concept of like

352
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,720
sponsoring and stuff is so weird to me

353
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,700
and it's like normal it's so public yeah

354
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,010
it is normally it's like it's so

355
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,300
different for me so I always feel like

356
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,010
awkward when I when I asked you guys if

357
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,620
you if you want to instead of doing that

358
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,780
support by sponsoring it always feels

359
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,820
different and kind of weird to me so you

360
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:36,230
know money it's it's it's definitely

361
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,460
different it's like you almost have that

362
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,350
guilty feeling it was like why am I

363
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,929
asking for this but you know at the same

364
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,490
time it's like you know that's literally

365
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,340
like the main source of you know income

366
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,040
for creators is you know the things like

367
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,780
this I don't know if you guys know this

368
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,760
but I've never mentioned this public in

369
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,290
I think ty is one of the only people who

370
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,630
knows this but Adam versus gaming this

371
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,250
channel it used to be skiver gaming

372
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,500
people know that of course but what they

373
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,360
don't know is that Adam versus gaming

374
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
actually makes like no money like other

375
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,630
than when I do these live streams and

376
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,059
and stuff like that but it happens

377
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,540
basically because a long time ago I I

378
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,700
wound up you know getting permission

379
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,679
from this music artist known as virtual

380
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,150
riot and for the music in my intro and

381
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,160
then lo and behold like a year later

382
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,780
when the channel is booming and making a

383
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,330
lot of money he you know copyright claim

384
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,070
everything so like literally every

385
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,280
single video on Adam versus gaming slash

386
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,900
diversity makes no money so like I

387
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,460
haven't I haven't made a dime on that

388
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,040
channel for like two years so well

389
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,990
actually probably since I started I I

390
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,700
didn't make I haven't made any money on

391
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,910
that channel so figured I would let you

392
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,169
guys know for all the people out there

393
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,570
who was saying I was just doing this for

394
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,910
money and like gaming shit in general

395
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,940
for money I did sky vs. gaming for three

396
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,419
years no money yeah it's for the you

397
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,130
know entertainment of the fans and you

398
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,470
know it's having a better relationship

399
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,179
with the fans because you know sometimes

400
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,130
even if you don't make any money be

401
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,570
having the better relationship with the

402
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,870
fans is you know good because if you get

403
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,900
close to your fans they're not much yeah

404
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,000
they lurch but not not in the money way

405
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,080
but it's like you know they're more

406
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,179
likely to support you know everything

407
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,530
you go through and you know stick around

408
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,630
longer and you know in the long run you

409
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,750
know not monetary but you know that's

410
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,780
just sometimes worth more than money you

411
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:42,230

01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,710
was canon oh really

925
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:52,940
yeah no it's not it's it's like confused

926
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,910
me actually it's a promotional anime for

927
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,590
this new well not even a new game it's

928
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,120
gonna game that's been out in Japan for

929
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,670
like the longest time called called the

930
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,590
Dragon Ball Heroes and it's basically

931
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,860
this like arcade game with like a bunch

932
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,740
of stuff that you can do it's it's neat

933
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,020
I guess but um it's not in America it's

934
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,910
been it's been a Japanese released so

935
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,780
that's why why uh when this this little

936
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,460
promotional animated came out not a lot

937
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,900
of people were like oh my god this is

938
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,290
crazy because like that that uh that

939
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,730
game actually has a lot of its own

940
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,620
cutscenes like one of the biggest

941
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,860
cutscenes that people made viral at

942
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,560
least from the US was when there was

943
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,520
that cutscene

944
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,790
Super Saiyan for Broly dividing against

945
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:41,030
Bardock and the animation is exactly

946
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:43,160
like Dragon Ball Z it's just it's just

947
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,410
not canon you know it's a video game but

948
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,940
the whole entire premise of the video

949
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,130
game at least the story plot is kind of

950
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:53,360
cool like you watch Super right yeah so

951
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,880
you know how like in Super they finally

952
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,980
drop the bombshell on dice that it

953
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:01,490
there's 12 universes yeah or r18 if you

954
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,830
want to be specific including the ones

955
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:07,910
that said Oh deleted you find out in in

956
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,860
this series that there's they bring in

957
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,740
not only you know the multiple universe

958
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,350
theory they bring in multiverse theories

959
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:18,020
so they start bringing in a thought

960
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,750
process that their what-ifs well not not

961
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,290
even what ifs like the concept is like

962
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:27,710
that it's it's like there's infinite

963
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:29,540
realities like the Rick and Morty effect

964
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,430
you know oh yeah there's like infinities

965
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:34,550
they basically bring that in and say

966
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,590
that there's like infinite multiverses

967
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,859
to these twelve universes as well and so

968
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:43,130
they start like it brings in like you

969
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:44,240

970

972
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,430
xenoverse there's a there's the

973
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:51,260
time-traveling trunks where he goes from

974
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:51,800
place to place

975
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,119
yep it's a correct history so basically

976
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,840
in in this series like there's like a

977
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,700
completely different alternate timeline

978
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,740
where like Goku is one of those as well

979
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,980
and and it's just like there's like tons

980
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,109
of different Goku's from like sands who

981
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,830
never got blown up by Frieza to like

982
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,440
like Bardock or Goku if he had been

983
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,800
raised by Bardock to just tons of

984
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,600
different shit like and so they they

985
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,780
bring in all these crazy multiverse

986
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:26,660
theories into the into the mix which is

987
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,830
uh which is kind of cool it seems pretty

988
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,900
neat is Dragon Ball Heroes it's been out

989
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,270
for a while though right yeah is that

990
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,220
the little cut scene I saw wear trunks

991
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:41,540
go super saiyan 3 yeah yeah and that uh

992
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,970
in that multiverse there's like tons of

993
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,650
different things from like Super Saiyan

994
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,490
4 bro leads

995
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,530
- I mean the first episode of this

996
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:53,580
promotional anime literally has a Super

997
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,800
Saiyan 4 Goku vs Super Saiyan God Goku

998
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,910
yeah I watched it this morning yes

999
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:04,620
fucking lame it was alright but I mean

1000
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,210
it just was kind of that's why I asked

1001
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:10,770
it was like confusing yeah honestly I I

1002
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,190
really I really hope that they like like

1003
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,650
pay attention to the fans because all

1004
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,510
those this does seem like fanservice I

1005
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:20,280
feel like what they're not really paying

1006
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,990
attention to is the fact that you know

1007
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:25,620
they haven't added in Garfield and I

1008
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:29,910
feel like I feel like ever since they

1009
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:35,130
took Garfield out Garfield you know type

1010
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,370
1 C 3 s Garfield and dragon ball I do I

1011
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,780
missed some turning gold

1012
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,040
I missed Super Saiyan Garfield I know it

1013
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,800
was the best one

1014
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,070
what did did you like Dragon Ball super

1015
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,420
good I thought it was pretty good too

1016
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,650
deep well yeah she teased obviously the

1017
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:58,980
only part I was disappointed in was I

1018
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,830
thought you know trunks would Future

1019
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:07,790
Trunks would be a little bit more badass

1020
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,400
that's the only problem that I had with

1021
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,470
like they just defied so much Dragon

1022
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:17,280
Ball logic and yeah I mean they did that

1023
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,350
that that's the issue with GT though

1024
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,490
it's like good were like we'll you know

1025
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,650
Super Saiyan 4 is pretty stupid it's

1026
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,210
like well what's the logic was Super

1027
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:27,390
Saiyan blue or like all this stuff yeah

1028
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,040
it just doesn't none of it makes sense

1029
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,530
well I actually actually like super-sick

1030
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:34,350
before a lot so I did too I like Super

1031
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,120
Saiyan 4 I thought it made sense whereas

1032
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,590
super saiyan blue I couldn't quite

1033
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:44,850
understand like why stupid the only part

1034
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,900
of GT I really liked was the baby Saga

1035
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,130
yeah baby

1036
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:52,350
Alfred Gillis says atom and tie which do

1037
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,420
you prefer Star Wars or Dragonball Z or

1038
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,760
any anime for that matter

1039
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,310
don't watch anime um here's the thing

1040
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,140
actually no yeah it's how do you go

1041
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:00,580
first

1042
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,080
that's like two different genres

1043
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,070
completely but I mean if I've I like

1044
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,690
I've liked Star Wars or since I was

1045
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,640
really really really really little but I

1046
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,690
couldn't compare if you want to talk

1047
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,080
about anime then I could probably talk

1048
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,630
about Naruto all day

1049
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,120
I like Naruto a little bit more than

1050
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:20,780
Dragonball

1051
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,250
you mean borrachos dad yeah bortles dad

1052
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:28,340
you mean or you mean borrow two's

1053
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:36,380
grandpa's son but no yeah so star wars

1054
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,420
are Dragon Ball Z now what you're

1055
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,680
basically asking is which shaped our

1056
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,950
childhood more right because it's which

1057
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,110
do we prefer because both of them were

1058
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,510
groundbreaking in of them in an in and

1059
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,000
of their own right and they're they're

1060
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,860
not fucking similar in the slightest so

1061
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,230
I mean I guess if you want to say oh

1062
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:02,780
there's laser beams they're nothing

1063
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:05,420
alike if I were to just be like that one

1064
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,090
guy who's just like yeah I love Goku to

1065
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,040
death and I love Vegeta to death and and

1066
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,070
all that shit I think that I think that

1067
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,290
I like Dragonball Z because it was

1068
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:16,940
longer and had longer character

1069
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,270
character development so it made me bond

1070
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,980
with the characters more than I bonded

1071
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,890
with the characters of Star Wars so I

1072
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:27,770
guess that that would be my answer is oh

1073
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:30,910
my god I think I was dead what the hell

1074
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:33,500
yeah I'd probably say Dragonball

1075
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,160
I like tracking ball a lot and then also

1076
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:41,930
Star Wars I hated the solo movie like I

1077
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,060
just have to be honest like I know a lot

1078
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,620
of people are like no but it was okay

1079
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:49,910
Donald Glover I was like oh shit oh my

1080
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:58,100
god McDonald's lover was really good in

1081
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,200
the movie don't get me wrong the only

1082
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,510
the reason I did not like the solo film

1083
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,580
was just because it's like the fucking

1084
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:08,390
speed of everything it's like he meets

1085
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,410
everyone within

1086
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,380
hours yeah when he's ever known and I'm

1087
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:15,380
like what the fuck is going on like well

1088
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:18,710
I wanted better backstories and like all

1089
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,660
Star Wars movies ever since Disney

1090
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,340
bought it has been disappointment other

1091
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,960
than Episode seven I had a you know

1092
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,730
after I watched episode 7 I was like oh

1093
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:26,810
man you know this actually might be

1094
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:29,240
pretty good and episode 8 comes around

1095
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:37,670
