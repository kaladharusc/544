00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,990
stuff I'm dealing with and he's like

43
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,070
this is something you should tell your

44
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,869
audience this is something you should

45
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,549
communicate to them can we do it on

46
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,040
video can we talk about it so here we

47
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,930
are I don't know how long this is gonna

48
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,509
run strapped in yeah

49
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,549
it's get some food if you want or maybe

50
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,040
this is not the time for that yeah

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,890
please don't but I know like Rockley get

52
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,119
something right a lot of you guys

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,290
probably because he's a bigger guy and I

54
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,780
think and I think a lot of you guys wish

55
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,520
from a fan you could hang out with

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,229
boogie get to talk with him I know you

57
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,640
guys post your comments a lot of people

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,860
were very opinionated when it came to

59
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,770
his surgery or some of his weight loss

60
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,210
decisions because everybody thinks

61
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,100
they're you know a master at this thing

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,030
because they Google search something and

63
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,220
that's all well and good whatever but as

64
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,920
a fan

65
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,200
just as somebody who say subscribe to

66
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,459
the channel freeze ramen videos in a

67
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,370
real look at somebody who's struggling

68
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,500
with weight I'm curious as to why you

69
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,150
know what what gets somebody to that

70
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,270
point and I think Jesse knows me well

71
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,310
enough to know I said through a year

72
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,180
worth of nutrition seminars and and I

73
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,700
know what to do I know what I need to do

74
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,769
to lose the rest of this weight it

75
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,810
helped me lose the 200 pounds that I've

76
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,849
already lost I've got another hundred to

77
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,220
go well 60 some to go before I can get

78
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,530
the skin removal surgery and then that

79
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,209
it's a nightmare to lose the rest you

80
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,380
know I'm going right at Swift is worth

81
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,519

description box below if you wanna see

86
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,290

I do the right thing where I am now I

88
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,810
can lose and you know what it is a week

89
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,640
and I don't know what it is and

90
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,220
everybody out there knows what it is yet

91
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,400
eat healthy you exercise but but you

92
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,980
still are not either doing it and you

93
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,450
could say it's a motivation thing but

94
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,160
the motivation comes down to the whys of

95
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,630
it and there's so many of you right now

96
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,829
who I've seen say you know I lose thirty

97
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,450
pounds I put back on the thirty pounds I

98
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,950
lose 50 pounds I put back on the 50

99
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,440
pounds I was stuck in that cycle forever

100
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,410
and I used my surgery as a shortcut as a

101
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,040
first

102
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,250
rehabilitation to make me relearn

103
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,079
everything to do what I needed to do

104
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,850
that's why I ended up getting surgery

105
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,829
and yeah in a lot of ways it was a

106
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,590
shortcut now was it the easy path far

107
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,940
from it twenty thousand dollars

108
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,040
disappeared out of my bank account I I

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,709
was sick for a month I was throwing up I

110
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,600
was bleeding out of my mouth I was

111
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,980
throwing up blood I was vomiting blood I

112
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,660
was a secreting blood I was bleeding

113
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,370
from my side wounds that I was

114
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,829
constipated I was sick all the time for

115
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,319
the first six months eating was a chore

116
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,450
it was a miserable chore just trying to

117
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,790
get food into my body again and so I

118
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,290
don't know it was the easy way out but

119
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,350
it was definitely a shortcut that gave

120
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,910
me a way to learn the discipline

121
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,190
temporarily and you made that changes

122
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,700
because why at the time you know I I

123
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
thought you know Here I am happily

124
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,360
married Here I am going to be able to

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
live the rest of my life I'm doing it

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,270
for my family I'm doing

127
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,099
for my friends I'm doing it for my fans

128
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,750
and of course I was doing it for me

129
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,310
because for the first time in my life I

130
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,699
started to kind of enjoy things you know

131
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,030
because whenever I talk about this on my

132
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,919
channel a lot of a lot of times and I've

133
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,210
talked to you about it privately why I'm

134
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,830
so afraid to talk about it in this video

135
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,520
because people see the nice house people

136
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,500
know that I have a bank account people

137
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,120
know that I got the dog people know that

138
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,470
I've got a lot of nice things but

139
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,259
depression anxiety these are things I've

140
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,430
struggled with ever since I was a kid

141
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,340
and for the first time in my life with

142
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,870
all of this other great stuff in my life

143
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,120
I was starting to crack through that

144
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,500
anxiety that depression and I'm like

145
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,050
now's the time now is the time to really

146
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,300
grab this thing by the brains and get

147
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,610
better and lose the weight and be a

148
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,409
better husband and and and be a better

149
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:15,229
youtuber and be a better not role model

150
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,190
because I've never considered myself

151
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,289
that but a good example a good example

152
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,120
of making the right decision and getting

153
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,770
better and all that sounds really good

154
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,270
it sounds like the packaged version

155
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,199
right of why you made the change but I

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,349
think for a second I want to strip you

157
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,780
away from that okay I want to and I

158
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,190
wanted to be just us having a

159
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,289
conversation okay to where it's just

160
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,139
like because in this way the last I'm

161
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,639
gonna reference them for a moment cuz

162
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,819
you guys get to see boogy doing his

163
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:44,449
thing

164
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,090
for you guys so he's constantly aware of

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,060
tell you when I was 15 I tried to kill

176
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,259
myself for the first time and I was

177
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,349
unsuccessful right um but I never

178
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,300
stopped trying man I would go to a

179
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,360
doctor when I was 25 and they would say

180
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,289
you know if you keep eating the way you

181
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,479
eat you're gonna be dead by 30 so you

182
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,310
wanted to die I wanted to die man I was

183
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,610
just so unhappy and I knew I didn't have

184
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,259
the strength or the weakness or whatever

185
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,210
it takes to like harm yourself to like

186
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,630
end it as I tried and I failed but I

187
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,980
thought if I got to do this

188
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,810
that I really enjoyed which is eating

189
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,390
food and I got to kill the pain for a

190
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,920
while made me feel better it made me

191
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,060
feel good it's the only thing that ever

192
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,140
made me feel good

193
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,680
and then I also got to die that's that's

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,690
a win-win-win all across Drive you to

195
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,590
get to that point I mean I people I

196
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,150
don't think people really understand how

197
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,210
severe my anxiety and depression really

198
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,430
are you know but I was a shut-in for

199
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,630
seven years Jesse I didn't leave the

200
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,100
house for seven years because my anxiety

201
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,140
was so bad I would I would sneak out in

202
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,040
the middle of the night to go to

203
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,960
McDonald's to 24-hour McDonald's I Drive

204
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,910
there I drive back if the guy asking me

205
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,200
questions I Drive away and go to a

206
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,310
different McDonald's don't want to

207
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,070
interact with humans you know I was so

208
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,080
nervous so anxious I had all my food

209
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,730
delivered four years due to social

210
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,490
anxiety social anxiety and where did

211
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,720
that come from because I don't think

212
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,880
that's just like natural to have that I

213
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,500
mean for some people it is I mean

214
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,550
there's some people out there don't

215
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,590
experience trauma but I experienced

216
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,250
trauma and that comes from I'm like

217
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,500
forget forget that they're even there

218
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,230
because there's people struggling when

219
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,850
when I when I go to Overeaters Anonymous

220
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,530
that I've only been a few times when I

221
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,110
go and we talk about it most of the

222
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,850
people my size I got to like five six

223
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,350
hundred pounds it's always one thing

224
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,620
it's you were abused as a kid and that

225
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,300
abuse almost always includes sexual

226
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,250
abuse especially for the women like all

227
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,840
of these women that get really really

228
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,820
big so many of them had received sexual

229
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,380
abuse at some point their childhood but

230
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,290
it involves like some sort of mental and

231
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,330
physical abuse and I got it in space for

232
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,580
the moment I was born like I my father

233
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,320
being an alcoholic and him being abusive

234
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,200
and my mother being abusive and and my

235
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,970
sister my mother being broken and they

236
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,050
were both older than me so they were

237
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,580
able to do crazy stuff too and it just

238
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,180
it 18 years of of just straight out

239
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,210
misery when I was 15 I'd had enough at

240
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,480
15 I was just ready to die at 15 and it

241
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,400
didn't get any better did the food come

242
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,169
from somewhere because why was it food

243
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,729
would you it wasn't the decision to be

244
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,229
this is what I'm gonna use to kill my

245
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,690
mom mom would use um food as like a like

246
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,940
there's a tool of the abuse I mean I sat

247
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,770
down when I was 25 years old that she

248
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,230
told me I'm sorry I fed you wrong I did

249
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,790
it on purpose like she knew what she was

250
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,400
doing she knew what she was doing was

251
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,980
did it on purpose like she said if she

252
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,630
thought I got fat enough I would never

253
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,490
be able to leave the home and I'd stay

254
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,510
with her forever because she didn't want

255
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,000
to be lonely in life she told me that if

256
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,279
I got so fat a girl never found me

257
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,020
attractive she'd never have to worry

258
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,430
about me getting married having kids and

259
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,740
leave her and that was her plane and

260
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,070
then she would use food as like a tool

261
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,380
so I would get the hell beat out of me

262
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,800
and then we go to McDonald's right get a

263
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,150
happy meal everybody's happy we're

264
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,430
having a happy I just I I you know I

265
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,560
come home to her and dad fist-fighting

266
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,630
and then oh let's do rush the kids off

267
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,029
to pizza and let's make things better

268
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,470
and I don't know food always did make

269
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,980
that things better right now eating

270
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,060
self-destructive terrible foods still

271
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,910
makes me feel better and that sucks

272
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,920
because I got so much that makes me feel

273
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,580
bad right now with the divorce and and

274
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,010
and trying to pilot this dying YouTube

275
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,540
channel and to keep it from by driving

276
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,010

277
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:54,940
going force a will discipline luck

278
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,709
I don't know what's the alternative dude

279
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,029
like what's the alternative like just to

280
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,220
give up if I was gonna give up I

281
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,570
would've gave up at 15 if I was gonna

282
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,830
give up I would've given up at 10 I'm

283
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,260
not gonna give up at 44

284
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,920
you know like you do what you do there's

285
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,420
a lot of people counting on me you know

286
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,830
I gotta take care of my dog I gotta take

287
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,480
care of me I gotta take care of my my

288
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,040
roommate my best friend Mikey I gotta

289
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
take care of people are counting on me

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,730
you know I I'm what else are you gonna

291
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,020
do like I'm going to just sit in this

292
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,010
house for seven more years

293
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,010
wait tada do you want to die now or you

294
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:33,940
want to live

295
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,040
most of me sees the logic in death is

296
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,589
inevitable I need to die I'm going to

297
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:42,860
die

298
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,389
doesn't change your name it's just going

299
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,690
to happen so why not just get it over

300
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,430
with right what's the difference between

301
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,350
five years from now or 15 years from now

302
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,220
what's the matter where's the difference

303
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,860
right and my brain is always thought

304
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,089
that way and it's always been this like

305
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,329
this technique where I just like deal

306
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:00,529
with the anxiety when the anxiety is

307
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,959
really bad and I can't sleep and I can't

308
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,180
think straight and I can't move and I

309
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,100
can't act I am my brain just says you

310
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,060
know it doesn't matter we'll die soon

311
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,519
anyway right and then sometimes I'll

312
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,870
just say you know what then let's get a

313
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,279
pizza today today's the day we get a

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,540
pizza and I still can't eat a whole

315
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,620
piece I can't eat half a piece I can

316
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,209
only eat two slices right thanks to the

317
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,040
surgery but I'll do it from time to time

318
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,079
I will completely give in the cause that

319
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,079
self-destructive part of me just says

320
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,730
it's inevitable it's going to happen so

321
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,970
she's doing but there is a part of me

322
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,160
just before getting the surgery that saw

323
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,550
the light at the end of the tunnel and

324
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,040
then we got light just thrown so far

325
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,509
away from that light like with the

326
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:41,120
divorce and and my entire family just

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,860
disappearing overnight like how do you

328
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,420
do that how do you deal with that I

329
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,699
don't know I went from having no family

330
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,709
in the world to having 150 people to

331
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,870
call a family to nobody again right

332
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,250
sitting in this house alone for

333
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,389
Christmas how do you deal with it I'm

334
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,069
supposed to do that but you know I had

335
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,620
that part of me still is still tiny part

336
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,139
of me is saying what if I took control

337
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,819
for a little while like what if I got to

338
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,439
run the show let's see where that goes

339
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,269
you never done that right yeah that's

340
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,160
the one thing you haven't done you let

341
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,139
the stupid self-destructive party you do

342
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,399
whatever I wanted to do and this is

343
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,529
where we got you've let me run the show

344
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,959
just a tiny bit and it helped you build

345
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,399
a youtube channel I help you run a

346
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,689
marriage I help you get your shit

347
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,660
together let me do it let me fix it let

348
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,860
me let me be in charge and I desperately

349
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,970
want to let that happen it's so tiny and

350
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,920
it's such a quiet little voice but it's

351
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,170
there but that's why just before you

352
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,850
came in the reason I wanted you to come

353
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,079
in one of the reasons I wanted to do

354
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,139
this with you is because I'm so tired of

355
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,600
living that life man who just eat sleep

356
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,579
eat sleep self-destruct sleep self

357
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,699
actually wait to die and I I so I

358
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,439
started therapy again and I started two

359
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,999
types of therapy I got the one on my

360
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,549
phone the phone app and then I got the

361
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,600
person I'm seeing and I started the new

362
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,040
pharmaceutical and we're almost a month

363
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,509
in now and I'm starting to notice slight

364
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,100
differences so I hope we have the right

365
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,639
one I just want to try to be better and

366
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,199
the worst part about it is the worst

367
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:10,549
part about it is one of the things that

368
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,790
the weight doesn't matter to me like

369
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,199
that's the most frustrating thing when I

370
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,639
was at my biggest it still didn't matter

371
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,660
you know I don't hate myself for being

372
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,639
fat I don't hate myself for looking

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,899
gross I look in the mirror I know I'm

374
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,360
gross I look at my crappy teeth I know

375
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,519
I'm gross I don't care I don't care it's

376
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,439
never bothered me this is the body I

377
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:33,170
have I don't care what I care about now

378
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,509
is being miserable I'm just done being

379
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,079
miserable I'm just tired of being angry

380
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,759
although all the time I'm tired of being

381
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,069
sad all the time I'm tired of just being

382
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,509
self-destructive all the time I want to

383
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,639
see how it's like to be you for a change

384
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,269
man and I watch you build a business for

385
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,559
yourself build a business for your

386
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,419
family the people you care about I see

387
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,100
you bending over backwards to take care

388
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,860
of people you know and people flock to

389
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,989
you because of it I don't be that guy I

390
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:04,249
want to do that you know just once just

391
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:05,689
a few years you get your whole life to

392
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:10,149
do it I'd like to do it for ten years I

393
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,350
that was always the biggest thing I had

394
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,850
the biggest issue I had I used to say on

395
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,779
my youtube channel all the time

396
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:19,669
Jesse I'd say I know what to do I don't

397
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,819
know how to do it and that's because I

398
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,679
could never get my brain into that right

399
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,319
place therefore the first time a year

400
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,389
and a half ago my brain was strongly in

401
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,509
the right place it's too little too late

402
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,749
for my marriage you know it was too

403
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,129
little too late for a lot of things I

404
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,799
cared about but it's never too late for

405
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,869
everything right I don't know maybe I'll

406
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:43,429
meet somebody else once I get my shit

407
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,629
together maybe that was always part of

408
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,699
the play and maybe I get to travel the

409
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,230
world and and maybe I'll do it alone and

410
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,029
maybe it'll just be awesome do you alone

411
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,559
how awesome would it be if I could just

412
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,399
like being alone

413
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,899
how awesome would it be if I just like

414
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,260
me do you like you

415
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,029
I hate like these guys who like post

416
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,560
them a comment section or have like

417
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,810
these little sub forums about hating

418
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,700
them they can never hate me as much as I

419
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,020
eat meat and and it and I know your next

420
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,720
questions gonna be why it's just because

421
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,029
my therapy my therapist said everyone

422
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,500

423

rest of my life dedicated to charity I

456

458

467
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,350

476
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,510
self-destructive meal I'm doing that

477
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,040

480
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:22,740
me getting better

481
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,670
I remember watching a video rambling one

482
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,040
of the rambling videos actually not too

483
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,820
long ago that actually had an impact on

484
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,110
me I remember your talking I think it

485
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,030
was prior to you going to the creator

486
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,690
summit and you're like dealing with the

487
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,730
surgery and like it was a big trip you

488
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,960
were really nervous for and you did a

489
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,970
rambling video prior to it and you were

490
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,160
terrified yeah you were having no like a

491
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,130
literal freak out like it was low key on

492
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,919
the rambling video and I saw I saw it

493
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,750
for a second it is like I wish you could

494
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,429
have seen it like before getting on the

495
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:57,960
plane and just like around the house I

496
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,080
was I was completely disassociated was

497
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,059
completely out of my mind I was like

498
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,260
walking around this house just like

499
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,179
sweating bullets and terrified there's

500
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,500
no way I can do this even with a friend

501
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,700
even with a friend I can't do this I

502
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,110
can't do this out without my ex-wife

503
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,419
can't do that there's no way and then of

504
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,890
course you saw I know you're leading at

505
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,990
the jubilation and the vlog and the

506
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,360
jubilation when I got home the problem

507
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,340
with that is that is like for a

508
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,900
narcissist like a youtuber like one of

509
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,549
us

510
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,010
that's like mainline and heroin directly

511
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,299
into your brain I got that from a

512
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,809
Netflix the movie but that kind of

513
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,640
attention man and you and you're in New

514
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,440
York and you're on top of the world and

515
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,150
and there's markiplier there's

516
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,220
jacksepticeye there's the CEO of YouTube

517
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,710
and and and there's all this great food

518
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,059
and drinks coming around and you're

519
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,710
having the best time and it was triple

520
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,179
the jubilation though because you prove

521
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,160
something to yourself there's a thing

522
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,230
that was a big part of that too but then

523
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,870
I get home and then I'm just stuck in

524
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,730
this brain again and this brain is

525
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,950
saying you don't deserve that why do you

526
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,150
think you deserve that why do you think

527
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,309
you're special you're some fat idiot in

528
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,919
Arkansas it was a pity invite anyway why

529
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,240
would you be one of a hundred ten

530
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
creators invited to something like that

531
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,669
you don't deserve that you'd never

532
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:09,780
deserve anything like that you're a

533
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,669
piece of crap like they made a mistake

534
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:13,950
whose invite did you actually get whose

535
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,290
slot did you take up not what about the

536
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,320
other part of you one or more of that I

537
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,310
love that give it so much for that

538
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,590
that's how it's always been this is how

539
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,270
I fell in love with my wife you've heard

540
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,230
the story they have not heard the story

541
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,300
the way I fell in love with my wife

542
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,860
she came to Fayetteville and we'd been

543
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,960
talking for a while and I knew that she

544
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
was a potential person to fall in love

545
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,650
with but I didn't know until we really

546
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,530
would got to be around each other and

547
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,800
she was so in love with this city and I

548
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,300
understand that this city is magic I

549
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,100
understand that Dickson Street is

550
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,990
amazing I understand that the people

551
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,250
that live here some of the best people

552
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,290
in the world I understand it I can't

553
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,930
really feel it but when we were together

554
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,570
that weekend and she was driving through

555
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,190
these mountains and smiling from ear to

556
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,570
ear and meeting the people and talking

557
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,100
about how incredible they were I could

558
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,660
see it through her eyes and for that

559
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,810
brief minute I could feel what she was

560
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,240
feeling and that's like crack cocaine

561
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
because I've never felt that a lot a

562
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,410
moment I've never met a single person

563
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,150
I'm sorry to all the fans I've met I'm

564
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,770
sorry to all the fellow craters I've met

565
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,820
I never met anybody that made me feel

566
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,010
the way just driving down the streets of

567
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,600
Fayetteville made her film and then when

568
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,010
I took her all over the world man and we

569
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,890
went to Hollywood we got to El Lela we

570
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,810
went to New York and and I got to

571
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,480
experience it through her eyes and New

572
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,040
York's just a city it's just the place

573
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,950
la is just a place but to her it was

574
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,650
magic and then that made it magic for me

575
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,630
I don't know how to feel that myself I

576
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,230
don't know you did briefly I mean

577
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,900
there's like I said you felt it she's

578
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,340
not putting feelings in you your own

579
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,870
mind is creating them just as much as

580
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,250
your own mind has created all the

581
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,440
negative stuff this is something he said

582
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,130
to me the other night

583
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,070
and I want to repeat it here he's like

584
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,270
you know when you were doing that stuff

585
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,380
for your family when you were doing that

586
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,380
stuff to create a better things for you

587
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,180
and your wife you're really doing it for

588
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,010
you and I was like no no I was doing

589
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,120
this for my family it's doing it for

590
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,010
more he's like yeah but it made you feel

591
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,660
good to do that for your family you

592
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,310
benefit from all of that the good

593
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,110
feelings you were having it's why you

594
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,640
were doing that you weren't doing it as

595
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,860
a slave you were doing it to help you

596
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,260
didn't you like helping like that's what

597
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,970
you said and that like really struck me

598
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,280
because why don't I try to do more

599
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,630
things like that like why don't I help

600
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,530
for me and maybe just maybe I try

601
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,700
helping me

602
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,560
yeah which is something I've never done

603
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,210
that's some helping you helps everyone

604
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,100
because people look to you boogie this

605
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,450
is why I'm in therapy again right

606
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,220
because I think to be honest with you

607
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm not I'm not gonna get that last 60

608
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,930
70 off I need for surgery if I don't if

609
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,410
I don't get into therapy if I don't have

610
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,240
someone to talk to you like you or a

611
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,580
professional more importantly who can do

612
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,470
the same thing that we did the other

613
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,350
night I don't know right and that's the

614
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,090
worst part about it is I think I think

615
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,800
my biggest mistake was I think the

616
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,000
reason my marriage failed I think the

617
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,010
reason I spent seven years alone I was

618
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,660
always in and out of therapy but I was

619
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,460
always combative with my therapist I

620
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,620
wasn't ready to do it that part of my

621
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,510
brain that says hey why are we here why

622
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,920
are we trying to get better don't we

623
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,510
want to die we should go die let's do

624
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,860
the Fight Club thing let's see if we can

625
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,560
hit rock bottom right why would you

626
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,400
listen because you've only been hurt and

627
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,530
I don't know I thought to be honest with

628
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,450
you when I got hurt again with this you

629
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,100
know me and my ex-wife fallen out of

630
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,590
love and decided it would be better off

631
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,600
we'd be better off alone and we are

632
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,670
she's happier I'm happier that's it's

633
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,430
good but I thought I was never gonna

634
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,900
trust again I know it's gonna never love

635
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,350
again and maybe I won't but that doesn't

636
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,000
mean it's all over right

637
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,890
I opened yourself up to the possibility

638
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,570
open yourself up to the opportunity

639
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,760
invite people and see what happens I've

640
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,740
got birthed a few times since her you

641
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,980
know it sucks it sucks I trusted only a

642
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,300
handful of people and some of the things

643
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,260
those people did but I know I gotta

644
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,720
learn to trust me I don't that's that's

645
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,550
that's really it yeah I gotta learn to

646
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,030
like me but it's hard man I don't know I

647
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,530
don't even know where you begin with

648
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,630
that something that I think 98% of the

649
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,830
people that are watching right now take

650
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,160
for granted the ability to just think

651
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,200
that they deserve good things to think

652
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,850
that they deserves to be nice to

653
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,490
themself yeah I think I think everyone's

654
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,170
comparing themselves everybody and like

655
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,330
that's kind of why I wanted to push you

656
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,770
this video only for yourself but for

657
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,900
everyone watching is like I hate myself

658
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,690
most days too I mean that's just

659
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,030
self-improvement you know and dislike so

660
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,290
many things about yourself cuz you do

661
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,840
want to be better but then there's so

662
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,240
many things whether it's from people

663
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,190
online especially for youtubers or just

664
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,480
other people in your life where it's

665
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,060
just constantly like especially if

666
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,340
you're really self-aware you can get

667
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,810
self-aware to the point to where it's

668
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,630
like really bad to where it's like any

669
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,640
little blemish or whatever gets blown

670
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,320
out of proportion but it goes but that's

671
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,060
where I've always been yeah like that's

672
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,560
that's the thing like I don't care about

673
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,850
my teeth I don't care about my face I

674
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,910
don't care about any this who cares this

675
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,610
this I hate this gray matter between my

676
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,340
ears man I hate the way I think give me

677
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,260
your own life animate the way I feel I

678
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,370
mean it's not even that man I just I

679
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,770
don't know it's it's terrified even I

680
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,910
don't want to say to them I won't say it

681
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,010
to you but I want it comes down to the

682
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,300
fact I don't think I'm a very good

683
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,330
person and I've done good things I know

684
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,210
that there's not a way to do enough good

685
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,100
in this world and I think a lot of that

686
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,590
comes down like the the example my mom

687
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,020
gave because my mom was a monster I mean

688
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,910
she was a torturous evil monster but she

689
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,010
was also crazy she was crazy

690
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,130
and she didn't mean sometimes I think

691
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,810
she did sometimes I think she took joy

692
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,070
of the things she did does but for the

693
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,860
most part it was just its tortured brain

694
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,080
doing miserable stuff because she didn't

695
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,360
know any better she couldn't control it

696
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,490
but she also taught headstart for 25

697
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,370
years preschool for underprivileged kids

698
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,170
autistic kids kids in wheelchair kids

699
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,540
the kids with no income handicapped kids

700
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,030
the kids with Down syndrome and gave

701
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,530
them a place to you know kids that

702
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,360
weren't eating at home getting a square

703
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,040
meal for breakfast and lunch before they

704
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,410
went home these kids who were getting

705
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,700
abused at home she would get them

706
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,380
removed from home she would work with

707
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,650
these parents to get them back to to

708
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,600
school so they would get off of welfare

709
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,070
so they could actually provide for the

710
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,590
kids and get him out of the local income

711
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,880
situation and help them get jobs

712
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,820
she would buy gifts on Christmas with

713
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,430
her own money to give to those kids she

714
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,790
would you know she would go to the local

715
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,380
grocery store on Thanksgiving to make

716
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,880
sure there was meals for the families

717
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,220
who didn't have anything she gave and

718
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,880
gave and

719
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,010
and gave and gave and gave to try to

720
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,250
make up for what she was doing at home

721
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,760
and she never forgave herself and if she

722
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,280
did that much good and she couldn't

723
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,660
forgive herself how the hell do I

724
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,470
forgive me you know I don't know how to

725
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,060
do that I don't know how I don't know

726
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,700
how to feel okay about myself I never do

727
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,550
that's why internet hate bothers me so

728
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,310
much sometimes because and I believe

729

they're right sometimes right like looky

730
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,620

across in your videos yeah man I have to

732
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,950
try to be nice I have to put effort into

733
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,740
being nice I have to choose when I wake

734
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,560
up every day to be a good person to be

735
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,450
kind to people on the Internet to be

736

tell me I still choose I still choose

739
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,180

744
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,440
never processed it I've never dealt with

745
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,340
it I don't even know where to start and

746
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,620
and and and so you know what I did is I

747
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,290
shoved it down and chased it with a

748
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,000
cheeseburger and chased it with a bull

749

ice cream and now and I knew I knew

750
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,780
talking to other people who got the

751
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,780
surgery I knew I wasn't gonna be able to

752
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,670
do that anymore and I knew I would come

753
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,740
apart I knew I would fall apart I knew

754
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,790
I'd have to find new ways and I did if

755
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,380

business I would come in here and I

763
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,310

those of you who may watch the channel

797
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,920
when it was at its best for those of you

798
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,170
stuck around those of you just watch a

799
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,520
few Francis sketches when you're going

800
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,720
through high school for the people who

801
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,790
are just here temporarily or even the

802
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,870
people who've just been here the whole

803
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,690
time know that you are the reason I had

804
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,150
the motivation to ever do this that you

805
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,570
know the the the fact that you guys gave

806
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,840
me any positive response at all was

807
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,160
fulfilling the fact that you made my

808
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,500
dreams come true of having a nice house

809
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,860
to live in to have a money in the bank

810
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,510
so that I could afford the surgery I

811
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,950
needed so that I knew I could have

812
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,270
health insurance for the first time in

813
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,890
my life it has brought me such

814
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,990
incredible peace of mind that I could

815
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,460
finally start working on this if you

816
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,280
guys think by watching this video that I

817
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,430
don't appreciate you it's the opposite

818
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,740
you guys are the only thing in my life I

819
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,050
like I I don't know if you understand

820
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,680
that when I meet you guys at at VidCon

821
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,720
when I meet you guys in the street when

822
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,640
I meet people at Walmart look what just

823
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,080
did and who knows me it

824
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,680
it's probably the only time and a day

825
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,720
other than I'm stuffing my fat stupid

826
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,810
face I don't feel like crap so I'm glad

827
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,250
you said that because that's and that's

828
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,260
why I was pushing Dawg it's like you

829
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,290
know it's easy to get used to this

830
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,740
lifestyle or having fans even or being

831
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,930
internet famous or even famous but like

832
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,620
for me for me growing up super insecure

833
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,650
you might not see it now but for

834
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,720
everyone who like never believed in me

835
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,510
and all the hard times over the last few

836
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,020
years it's been it's been you guys in

837
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,760
the internet that's really kept me going

838
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,220
and made me feel like I was worth

839
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,800
something and I can see why you guys on

840
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,690
the internet whether it's Instagram

841
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,850
Twitter Facebook YouTube even where you

842
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,410
guys want to grow your following cuz

843
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,210
it's like a validator and it's like it

844
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,690
makes me feel better about myself I get

845
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,080
that I feel better having my fans in the

846
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,720
light in my life and it's like I don't

847
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,370
know what I would do without them but

848
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,770
let me be proof like let me be proof man

849
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,410
it is validating it helps I'm not gonna

850
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,200
lie but it doesn't fix things money

851
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,540
doesn't fix things fame doesn't fix

852
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,390
things if you are miserable in your

853
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,850
trailer home you will be just as

854
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,440
miserable in your mansion man you got to

855
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,030
work on this this is the most important

856
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,500
thing in the world putting work into

857
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,970
this putting work into your brain

858
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,220
putting work into loving yourself it

859
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,200
doesn't matter if the entire world loves

860
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,210
you if you don't love you it's pointless

861
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,450
and I can tell you from a person who's

862
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,580
been wined and dined by YouTube as a

863
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,620
person who's been flown all over the

864
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,420
world to do appearances as a person

865
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,110
who's meant tens of thousands of fans it

866
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,990
helps but it ain't gonna fix you

867
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,780
therapy sometimes medication putting in

868
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,790
the work talking with friends whatever

869
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,270
you got support group wise and and

870
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,470
listen to this guy because I tell you we

871
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,760
have a lot more common you think that's

872
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,230
how we ended up bond there you might

873
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,280
think it's just because we made rich

874
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,370
videos for fun no man it's because this

875
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,800
just dude we have a lot in common we

876
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,120
should do what are these for you one day

877
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,210
yeah yeah

878
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,230
wait what do you weigh do you hear how

879
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,560
messed up this'll all right guys we

880
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,450
should wrap this up

881
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,489
it's probably like yeah an hour yeah for

882
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,889
you guys watching like what what is the

883
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:34,129
takeaway here I mean there's a lot but

884
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:38,210
not even us who you might look up to not

885
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,059
perfect and don't compare yourself to

886
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,950
our lives and the things that we have

887
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,989
and what you think will make somebody

888
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:48,049
happy or better know that you're special

889
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,580
the way you are then you're worth

890
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,279
something even followers not included

891
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,980
doesn't matter like we love you guys if

892
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,889
I'm worse if I'm worth an ounce than

893
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:59,749
you're worth ten pounds I promise you I

894
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,759
promise you have any respect for me I

895
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,350
guarantee you're a better person than me

896
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,429
I guarantee it

897
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:06,230
even though monsters on this little sub

898
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,369
ranch man sometimes I think they're

899
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,590
better than me right and if we do see

900
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,049
any hate we know that you're hurting

901
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:15,649
just as much and it's okay to be

902
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:17,149
vulnerable for once it's the Internet

903
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:18,710
that's the place where you can be a

904
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,779
vulnerable like just say something real

905
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,879
right cuz that I you know I learned to

906
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,259
be responsible the way I behave on the

907
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:25,609
internet but when I first came on the

908
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,409
Internet's what I did you know that's

909
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,389
why these these these guys have all like

910
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:30,859
the crazy fan theories and all the mean

911
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,929
stuff to say I get it man I know where

912
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,330
it comes from I got a lot more comedy

913
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,179
thing I was posted on 4chan back when

914
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:40,700
4chan was cooled and 4chan was never

915
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,769
cool so stay away from there but I'm

916
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,200
just saying that's it I get it man you

917
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,960
know I never take it personal I get it

918
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,009
hell I agree and drawing everything back

919
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:54,739
to wait for those watching looking for

920
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,929
some takeaway for their just know why

921
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,059
this video turned into what it did is

922
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,690
there's always a reason as to why we get

923
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,190
to a certain extent I was 60 pounds

924
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,590
heavier just because I didn't like

925
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,440
myself either those out there who don't

926
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,059
have weight problems they may watch this

927
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:14,149
for whatever ironic reason just no man a

928
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:15,530
little bit of empathy goes a long way

929
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,119
because most of the people who you see

930
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,359
who are super skinny or super you know

931
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,149
super fatter or are struggling out but

932
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:24,470
any other drug that you might be

933
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,819
addicted to you know foods not a drug

934
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,290
but it may as well be sugar practically

935
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,020
is anybody who's addicted to any of that

936
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,099
stuff and they're struggling they're

937
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:32,480
hurting man have a little empathy

938
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,760
empathy goes a long way it means a lot

939
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,379
for those of you have empathize with me

940
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,200

941
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,000
