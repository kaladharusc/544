1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,399
hey guys III break down winners and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,689
losers we're talking

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,029
Bethesda Conference and I'm just gonna

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,259
come out and say it

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,070
Bethesda had one of the better shows of

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,960
the whole conference I think in fact

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,220
maybe they won I'm gonna give my final

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,210
verdict at the end and we'll see where

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,890
that puts them but III think they might

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,990
win on this because they had the balls

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,220
to show to talk about and show hints

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,840
teasers at what they're working on plus

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,070
what they're showing now but

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,170
disappointed in some something so we'll

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,000
get to it right away but des des they

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,770
start off with this company thing you

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,620
know there's little hey I'm Bethesda I'm

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,489
Bethesda

19
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,230
I'm doing my partner you're doing your

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,600
part that the cook is as much of a part

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
of Bethesda everybody is true cuz my bug

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,340
has got to eat and if you don't get them

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,719
good food and then so but but that just

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,629
feels more like a corporate internal

25
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,750
video dude do we really care about that

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,059
was like the briefing video you get when

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,589
you start a new job it's like you're at

28
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,990
Wendy's we're all a team I love the wind

29
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,810
but I tell ya but but I excused it

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,000
because you know it's like big guy these

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,590
are guys are passionate they want to

32
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,759
show it's really cool to work at

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,710
Bethesda and I've talked with some of

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,360
these guys and it is cool to work with

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,100
Bethesda they're really cool guys

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,290
they're nice to us and they're one of

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,630
the when we were struggling to to get

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,490
coverage Bethesda was one of the ones

39
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,229
was like come Joe and I was getting all

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,180
these high profile things and I was like

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,500
Maura that's great that's why it

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,880
depressed me to see when they did this

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,500
turnaround no review copies and we're

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,420
all doing a show no press stuff but I

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,340
think they're starting to turn that back

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,020
around cuz I got into the press area

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,780
this time and and Todd was there I just

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,040
happened to be there I had already

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,950
talked and got a picture with Todd for

50
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,869
Jeff Kaylee's thing and and I was I told

51
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,340
her hey man I'm a big fan of all your

52
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,470
games you know and he said I've seen

53
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,689
your show and I was like so Todd Howard

54
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,649
I've seen the show dude and I don't

55
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,930
remember I I said something stupid to

56
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,850
Todd I remember I I couldn't say

57
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,590
something or I like tripped up on my

58
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,239
words I'm like I'm sorry man you're like

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,679
one of the only guys that makes me

60
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,490
nervous he's

61
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,380
really why and I was like fuck I

62
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,120
shouldn't send that because maybe he had

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,860
more respect for me before I said that

64
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,890
but but it was because you know I really

65
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,510
fucking love this guy and I see the

66
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,280
passion he puts his is and if you watch

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,810
in video interviews when this guy is

68
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,970
super young he's just like one of us

69
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,910
yeah no he's like when I grew up I mean

70
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,080
what do you want to do I want to make

71
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,090
video games and everybody make fun of

72
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,340
him and now he's fucking making some

73
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,170
good best video she's the coolest guy I

74
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,180
was like fuck my price Eunice said that

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,030
anyways I meet him later on at the PR

76
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,220
Bethesda booth and we're talking so hey

77
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,960
Joe and I was like a man and he was in

78
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,430
between interviews I was thinking about

79
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,190
asking him because normally angry Joe

80
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,250
you know do ambush interviews and we're

81
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,660
gonna do this but it looked like he was

82
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,810
you know like in between interviews and

83
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,910
I was I talked with the person later to

84
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,410
try to get his setup but he says oh it's

85
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,880
all booked up I was like fuck I should

86
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,530
have done it right then in there you

87
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,120
know just pull something up but anyway I

88
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,010
was like you couldn't him and don't end

89
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,780
the conference on the mobile games like

90
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,240
not job so wouldn't do that and that's

91
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
when you know he talked about starfield

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,810
he's like what he told me was really

93
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,660
working excited about star field and he

94
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,010
wouldn't spill any details like where he

95
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,570
wouldn't tell us but but he's really

96
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,050
cool guy

97
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,810
so anyway none of that stuff company

98
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,790
thing they seem like a cool company to

99
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,020
work for so they start off with rage -

100
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,850
and they did a musical performance from

101
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,860
Andrew WC Gators that cannot be kept

102
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,600
during that whole spiel oh yeah yeah a

103
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,840
little awkward where was ID software who

104
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,030
I fucking love and then Avalanche studio

105
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,130
so it's two different studios maybe they

106
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,720
just didn't have the rapport I don't

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,660
know but then they got to the musical

108
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,610
performance from and you develop it I

109
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,340
was surprised that Andrew showed up

110
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,650
there that was a surprising thing what

111
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:14,160
would you think he has some interesting

112
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,590
music yeah the dude knew how to rock

113
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,109
yeah but that's not what I came here

114
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,819
I can see it in the crowd the crowd

115
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,789
wasn't like going crazy like this is

116
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,949
cool I feel sorry for him yeah he's

117
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,120
probably used to people who are yeah

118
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,629
fuck yeah we're all like we know can we

119
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,020
see the game but but I understand I

120
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,819
understand where it comes from it comes

121
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,629
from Lady look our studio is crazy our

122
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,639
game is crazy

123
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,439
are you ready to die are you ready to

124
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,419
you know and so so I was like alright

125
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,400
I'm alright with it as everybody makes

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,129
fun of it I was like no it wasn't bad

127
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,069
I'm with him I'm with it was awkward but

128
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,810
I'm with I mean everybody was supposed

129
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,580
to do sound like that's his fault they

130
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,620
put you a shame put him in a weird

131
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,719
situation right in his fault anyways so

132
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,060
raise two I got my hands on this game

133
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,539
it's it's fucking cool it is cool it is

134
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,729
pink doom you know how much we like doom

135
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,250
and and I fucking love that game

136
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,060
high-octane

137
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,000
it's basically do pink just doom in a

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,529
different thing and and that's the

139
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,330
highest compliment I'm saying that as a

140
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,789
compliment kind of thing you know

141
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,680
obviously it's got involvement of the

142
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,870
same studio that did do but it also has

143
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,219
Avalanche Studios I have about the

144
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:35,909
relationship there why is it maybe the

145
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:39,120
engine yeah and so they have this power

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,639
of mode where you you get you build up

147
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,379
your meter you hit the meter and then

148
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,039
you go crazy which kind of reminds me of

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,469
you know du mich kind of stuff but when

150
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:50,849
I went crazy I didn't feel like it was

151
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,469
strong enough maybe they're still

152
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:57,650
tweaking that but yeah very chattery

153
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,580
different from doom and the fact that

154
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,500
the people you're fighting very chattery

155
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,150
they're just talking shit they talk shit

156
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,550
that's always yelling and screaming and

157
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,460
and doing stuff so I'm down for rage too

158
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,069
they show multiple aspects of in unity

159
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,659
and driving around and you're doing this

160
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,870
and you're doing that so I'm excited for

161
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,360
it I'm reserving judgment just because

162
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,039
people seem to have forgotten that the

163
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,500
first rage was 5 out of 10 by most

164
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,629
reviews videos and it was well you were

165
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,509
you were like fuck rage - Rage 1 was

166
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,699
garbage the race one was garbage and I

167
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,240
was like look you don't over hype

168
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,409
ragequit

169
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,700
like oh I don't know

170
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,280
about range I mean it's like why is it

171
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,200
it's always dude when I checked it had

172
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,880
like a fifty one user score on

173
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,470
Metacritic with like four thousand

174
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,210
reviews which blows me away it's like

175
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,770
why are we doing this I don't know

176
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,240
whether you a different one but but I

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,180
guess but okay maybe you can you can

178
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,010
make this one the hit it's just awkward

179
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,540
I'll say for the fact now it looks a lot

180
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:54,870
better

181
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,640
I played rigs one all the way through

182
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,470
and this looks a lot better than Rage 1

183
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,270
and given what Joe said I'm really

184
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,490
hopeful for age - I'm just saying you're

185
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,740
gonna have fun you raise you know don't

186
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,560
get over height don't over - yeah I

187
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,270
here's what I think it's not gonna be

188
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,430
good as do but it's gonna be fun

189
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,350
yep that's what I think so if we gave

190
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,180
doom what a nine you're gonna expect

191
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,000
something like 87 yep hopefully not six

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,320
five anyway Elder Scrolls legends card

193
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,780
game I don't play it I did play for a

194
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,280
little bit and I thought well it's cool

195
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,660
but you know I went on to other things

196
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,310
but they're doing more content for one

197
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,810
thing I'll say about other shows legends

198
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,220
is it's different than a lot of other

199
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,040
card games because it has so much PvE

200
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,930
content where you're playing against

201
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,840
like scripted events and stuff I hope it

202
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,460
does well I was still identifying that

203
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,040
Elder Scrolls Somerset is the MMO and

204
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,560
I'll tell you Joe I've got so many

205
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,880
requests probably the highest amount of

206
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,320
requests to go back to this game and

207
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,590
then redo it and and you know there was

208
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,680
some devs there that way so you should

209
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,910
come played sorry man I did I want Elder

210
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,890
Scrolls 6 man it's just where my heart

211
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,590
is people II didn't realize that when

212
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,450
you get into an MMO to get to the new

213
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,940
content you have to go through all the

214
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,120
old content first so every story mission

215
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,490
you have to do solo and if you ever need

216
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,990
to do another story mission you can't

217
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,100
play with friends so if you play with

218
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,570
friends for like a side mission for like

219
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
five minutes it's like I've got to go

220
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,700
off by myself again so yeah all right

221
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,430
sorry camera was dying so we plug that

222
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,820
in so yeah summer said I had the

223
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,640
greatest of fun you know and a lot of

224
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,160
multiplayer games in multiplayer of

225
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,200
Elder Scrolls because I felt like a

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,910
general we were all running only

227
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,910
planetside 2 got to that level for me so

228
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,360
I wish that game well maybe we'll play

229
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,830
maybe not

230
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,810
but like I said my heart is really with

231
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,540
Elder Scrolls 6 then we move on to Doom

232
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,480
eternal so yes I just is surprised to me

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,570
and I was confused on the messaging you

234
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:17,290
know doom eternal is this a DLC I know I

235
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,320
asked him by the way another studio idea

236
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,290
that the soul our review really liked it

237
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,060
and stuff and I was and they came up to

238
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,340
me while we were at the Bethesda and we

239
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,240
were talking I was like what did you

240
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,010
call a dupe - and they were like well

241
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,050
there's already a doom - and I was like

242
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,480
was it was already a doom and they go oh

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,370
yeah well there's discussions there were

244
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,110
internal discussions I get the feeling

245
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,970
like maybe they were gonna do it but

246
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,740
then somebody was campaigning for this

247
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,150
and somebody was campaigning for that

248
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,240
whatever dual eternal I wish it was

249
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,220
doomed to eternal so more people could

250
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,990
be excited about it because people are

251
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,030
superficial they're dumb they don't know

252
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,060
that this could this is not a DLC this

253
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,670
is a full experience a full game be

254
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,130
excited hell on earth hell on earth but

255
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,170
they're not showing it much so you just

256
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,490
got a little bit and there would have

257
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,470
come to quake car will show it at

258
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,040
QuakeCon

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,380
wait cons actually really close to us

260
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,660
Joe so maybe we'll go out there and

261
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,750
cover it maybe we'll see doom was the

262
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,550
best game I've played in like four years

263
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,260
it was like my 10 out of 10 yeah it was

264
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,500
fun as hell not too bad it was for me I

265
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,350
was excited but very very very fun and

266
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,300
maybe doom eternal can reach that 10

267
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,820
water cleaner we'll see so super excited

268
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,460
and by the way the studio head is the

269
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,880
coolest fucking guy you know are the the

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,500
guy who was up there talking about a

271
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,170
Hugo he is really awesome and there's a

272
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,600
little known fact about him he created

273
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,340
the jaegers

274
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,130
some of the jaegers for Pacific Rim

275
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,320
that's awesome yeah gipsy Avenger was

276
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,880
one of his

277
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,160
that's like an artist yeah yeah he

278
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,680
doesn't do the art so much anymore but

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,839
he does like other stuff and creative

280
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,730
stuff he's really creative and I was

281
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,740
trying to convince him Joe's like we're

282
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,720
gonna be doing like a robot battling

283
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,100
game in the future you think maybe you

284
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,870
could do like a guest robot for us

285
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,730
that'd be pretty snappy pretty sweet but

286
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,769
it was like it was like but there were

287
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,110
handlers and other people there oh yeah

288
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,410
I talked to legal and they owners ask

289
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,199
you know we'll see we'll see maybe he'll

290
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,300
have some time to pneumatically anyway

291
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,940

that for a long time but you know we're

327
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,790
getting that I can't believe she's still

328
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,639
here we're talking about that desde you

329
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,160
know so but cyberpunk is taking care of

330
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,639
all my brain needs so if you guys

331
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,769
haven't played pray I probably suggest

332
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,170
you to go play pray yeah it was

333
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,000
fantastic again I think I gave me like

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,670
it's just the thing is the enemies were

335
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,680
boring as fuck that's what they really

336
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,270
interesting and I need

337
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,520
enemies a lot crazier this well the

338
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,470
middle of like like the moon crash

339
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,580
expansion has a bunch of different

340
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,590
enemies lots of elemental enemies like

341
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,060
really crazy stuff and it's more like a

342
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,400
roguelike than anything and it was fun

343
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,170
I've played it so far it's out now so

344
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,820
there are also studio I want to support

345
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,980
them we went out there but you know I

346
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,020
can't lie to you guys and it starts

347
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,450
sucking your dick my lord great game

348
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,640
more time it's like man the enemy design

349
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,040
man but that new mode 5 mimics verse 1

350
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,780
that's got me excited so one of the most

351
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,460
exciting post deals and post content

352
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,190
things even got Wolff Stein yeah even if

353
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,270
you didn't like the enemy design

354
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,710
watching you die over and over again

355
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,630
from coffee cups and shit so Wolfenstein

356
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,700
Youngblood is al it's gonna be the

357
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,640
daughters characters where they're gonna

358
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,980
go seek out their dad little do they

359
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,720
know where should I spoil it I don't

360
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,340
know little they don't know their dad

361
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,510
may be gone no no so how's that how's

362
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,130
that gonna continue the storyline are

363
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,000
you interested in that

364
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,760
no I reviewed the last I know so are you

365
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,280
interested in no because they're fucking

366
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,410
away from the freaking war and stop

367
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,300
doing side stories and focus on the damn

368
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,340
war which is what Wolfenstein is about

369
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,710
like we want to know how the Nazis were

370
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,900
no way Americans fight I want to win the

371
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
war I want to fight the war and that was

372
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,930
my biggest complaint about the last one

373
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,370
is you learn nothing to do with the

374
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,870
fucking war they just want to play

375
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,460
around in the world they want to get

376
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,530
this a franchise and never resolve the

377
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,110
war and there's going on and it's like

378
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,400
okay good thing you want to do story

379
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,360
stuff of men

380
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,820
I want the war yeah so I'm not really

381
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,730
that excited about it I will push that

382
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,770
on to del alright Skyrim that they did

383
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,230
this is why I think Bethesda gets it

384
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,150
they they are their plant having jokes

385
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,930
with themselves

386
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,200
Skyrim announced four edges sketch

387
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,380
announced for your fuckin beeper

388
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,770
announced for Alexa and and that is real

389
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,460
by the way

390
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,200
I can't wait for Skyrim on my smart

391
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,990
toaster I know and that's but you can

392
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,450
actually play the game on

393
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,960
it's not a joke you can play it on yes

394
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,390
yeah just like he was playing so who is

395
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,670
this George the guy from Jordan Navy oh

396
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,100
yeah he was fucking hilarious

397
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,880
it was a great little joke and that but

398
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,620
then it didn't segue right into some

399
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,630
Elder Scrolls stuff which is what I was

400
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,460
hoping it wasn't me she was like it's

401
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,890
gonna transition to announcing no

402
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,070
there's growing sick yes nope

403
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,080
instead we go to fallout 76 now this is

404
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,890
our most controversial one because I am

405
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,830
excited now when I first heard of it I

406
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,820
was like whoa rust clone no but then

407
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,950
Todd Howard comes out and he says no

408
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,680
there's gonna be quests there's gonna be

409
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,810
your fucking nuclear silos there's gonna

410
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,490
be this there's gonna be them you're

411
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,860
gonna be building and I I was like yes

412
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,300
okay I'm in so but I think we lost them

413
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,280
I like the premise but I've played more

414
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,380
survival games than anyone I know and as

415
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,060
when all these servers way more late

416
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,980
every game that is possibly even

417
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,570
slightly considered close to what

418
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,580
they're doing with this and I first see

419
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,610
a lot of issues not the big they have no

420
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,930
experience they don't have any

421
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,460
experience the biggest one that I can

422
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,410
take away from this is that okay so

423
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,180
you're probably excited you get to build

424
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,410
your base work with friends build a

425
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,530
really cool base and stuff some asshat

426
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,210
well I'm not gonna build base I'm gonna

427
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,580
command the base and a branded more most

428
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,650
the issue is that it looks like they're

429
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,360
not having player hosted servers in the

430
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,160
beginning they're gonna do it later on

431
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,150
from what they said they're gonna allow

432
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,770
players have modded servers and stuff

433
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,420
later on the biggest thing I really

434
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,830
honest oh you're gonna be on a Bethesda

435
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,540
server 24/7 it says you have to be

436
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,820
online to play the thing is is so you're

437
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,380
gonna spend what a hundred dollars on

438
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,000
your base and with the things like the

439
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,290
nukes you're of course gonna have I've

440
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,670
seen this in every game that has

441
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,170
anything like this code and exiles being

442
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,520
the best thing you get people who

443
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,350
exploit that system and do nothing they

444
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,150
never get their own base they just run

445
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,620
around and grab the new codes and

446
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,600
destroy other people's bases yes so

447
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,209
that's why we have C then I yeah but

448
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,699
that's why you create an enforcers

449
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,740
league when you go out and you hunt

450
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,140
those

451
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,750
the problem is this can happen when

452
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,179
you're offline and so if you piss

453
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,679
someone off and they were your basis

454
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,240
just to create a schedule all right we

455
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,429
have to take shifts guys it's just gonna

456
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,140
be the problem of they've never done

457
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,540
this before and as someone who's been an

458
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,059
asshole in those games before it's gonna

459
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,650
suck when you spend a hundred hours on

460
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,780
your bass and some guy names xx booty

461
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,780
Lords 69 nukes your ass there's nothing

462
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,660
you can do about it yeah and so and I

463
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,040
don't know how that works can we do

464
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,200
multiple characters that I need to know

465
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,720
that kind of stuff so I'm skeptical just

466
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,780
because I know how bad these sorts of

467
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,740
online yeah and I'm still excited you

468
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,600
guys fun for ice they need to handle

469
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,220
they're running mine because I want

470
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,890
multi I didn't want this a long time ago

471
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,140
and and as soon as I still want fallout

472
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,570
five okay I don't want this to end and

473
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,970
this is just a side thing this is listen

474
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,070
the way I look at it is what was that

475
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,330
game that they were doing they were

476
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,090
doing a mobile mobile thing or a battle

477
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,610
arena thing right battle right or

478
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,290
something I remember I think it was an

479
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,360
austin studio in fact i think this is an

480
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
austin studio - right am i getting that

481
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,710
wrong and and i'm like this is way more

482
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,110
exciting than that so I guess that's the

483
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,850
direction I'm coming at it and I've

484
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,500
always wanted to do fallout with

485
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,630
multiple people gluten shit it's all

486
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,040
about loot it's all about getting this

487
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,590
now let me be honest how are we done

488
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,480
like building stuff the building aspects

489
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,760
and fought for and really care for you

490
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,620
know I liked going on the story so the

491
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,210
one thing that has me concerned is I

492
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,520
think in an interview like off-camera it

493
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
was a game spot or something that didn't

494
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
really get a lot of views I should have

495
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,730
done it no I'm playing is it with Todd

496
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,419
Harrow Howard he said something like

497
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:09,929
there's no NPC quite so I said that's

498
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,790
that's got me concerned I'm still

499
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,070
excited for the game but how are we

500
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,200
gonna get these quests so Bethesda

501
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,280
number robots

502
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,500
you need to have player servers so we

503
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,360
can moderate and password-protect so we

504
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,890
can do stuff we can have friend servers

505
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,210
not to worry about this stuff and number

506
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,960
two you're gonna need crazy-ass anti

507
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,520
I hope you know that going into this and

508
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,370
number three add NPCs yeah

509
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,220
okay so after that so fallout 76

510
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,820
divisive ok I I think it I like it and

511
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,010
I'm looking at it in a different way and

512
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,320
I can understand where Dells come from

513
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,330
and I can understand where people on the

514
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,530
other side of dealt with it absolutely

515
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,400
no hell no but I am excited I mean I'm

516
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,080
not saying it's gonna be fun and it's

517
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,280
gonna be good I'm not saying otherwise

518
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,770
but I have seen this so many times in

519
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,770
other games alright so so kepta sysm

520
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,320
moving on elder scrolls blades a mobile

521
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,570
game i was like oh my god i think they

522
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,700
got addicted to that that that fallout

523
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,340
shelter they got that moat that those

524
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,400
those transactions are rolling in and

525
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,799
but this is like new revenue ok so I

526
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,020
will give I will give them this wasn't

527
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,520
it shitty as I thought it would be

528
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,650
now the control scream sucks you know

529
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,570
it's not a controller it's not a mouse

530
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,570
so it's kind of hard to like hit them

531
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,190
you're like moving and then you're

532
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,590
tapping to hit or you're holding to hit

533
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,830
and then you open your but it really had

534
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,530
a lot of features to it and I got the

535
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,570
like dungeon dive feeling and for a

536
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,250
little mobile game where a play on the

537
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,140
fucking toilet while I'm taking a shit

538
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,690
or whatever I don't know they're just

539
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,760
before bed you just fucking around

540
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,630
alright you know hate on it too much now

541
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,909
I need to see the microtransactions in

542
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:58,270
the game that's what I need to see and

543
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,070
god damn todd todd told me about I

544
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,010
fucking forgot dude do you realize how

545
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,250
many fucking things I see it is real

546
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,200
there is it there's in-game currency

547
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,610
that you don't pay for

548
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,880
and then there is paid currency what you

549
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,679
do with that paid currency I don't know

550
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,409
I don't know if it's loot chests where

551
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,330
you get other weapons that just haul it

552
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,330
fall I don't know so I'm sorry guys I

553
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,440
drop the ball on that one

554
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,210
but I will tell you is giving me a PR

555
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,890
answer I will tell you that so it's

556
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,110
probably not all that much information

557
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,309
and that's probably why I fucking forgot

558
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:33,230
it is I don't listen to PR answers

559
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,200
anyways so it wasn't as bad as I thought

560
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,970
and I think this would have done much

561
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,600
better if they showed elders

562
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,030
six and gave us a real trailer and then

563
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,669
said it's not ready yet guys we still

564
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:46,799
have to work on it so while you wait

565
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,530
here's Elder Scrolls blades play that

566
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,750
and it'll be and then before you know it

567
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,130
we'll have the game done but I think

568
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,900
that that would have only worked next

569
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,309
year you know what I mean because it

570
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:57,419
would have had more time to work on the

571
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,980
Elder Scrolls 6 they would have given us

572
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,510
an actual date and then here's the

573
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,010
mobile game play it in until the actual

574
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,110
day but they revealed this one early

575
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,090
because they need that money got it you

576
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,160
know what I'll play anything that isn't

577
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,370
skyrim skyrim again it's not every

578
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,620
release of skyrim so thank you Elder

579
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,270
Scrolls Skyrim blades and then so then I

580
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,309
was like oh man yeah and in the

581
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,860
conference on this Sun blades I was

582
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,289
wrong man I was tweeting but then he was

583
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,630
like up what we have one we have another

584
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,880
thing we're working on a brand new IP

585
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,070
and I was like oh my gosh please let

586
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,049
this be star field I was hyping Jo up

587
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,309
telling everybody about it and it was

588
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:40,049
unfortunately it was just a little

589
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:44,340
planet and that's about it then they did

590
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,059
the same we're not done I was like I was

591
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,559
one of those in there I can hear myself

592
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:53,610
in the video screen it is is Elder

593
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,100
Scrolls six and he reveals it and we're

594
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,409
flying over it and then the logo comes

595
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,690
up and I'm ready for it to transition

596
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,530
into a trailer or a teaser or a game

597
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,520
play and they got some nice rocks got

598
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,780
some rock rocks and I have no idea where

599
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,330
it is Elder Scrolls fans please in the

600
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,429
comments put where you think it is

601
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,620
hammer fell I think some people are

602
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,980
saying yeah so maybe hammer fell you

603
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,750
know what though those were elders rocks

604
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,880
but it has to be over there I want the

605
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
cut I think they were talking about Dark

606
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,169
Elves or drawing what is the darker

607
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:34,320
looking elves and then Kaji yeah I mean

608
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,390
I'd be okay with that cuz he mike the

609
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,730
liar better sell my home but it was just

610
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:47,490
a logo but whereas EA wouldn't show you

611
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,049
these things this early and wouldn't

612
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:50,320
even hive you up

613
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,170
they're in and it's you know I felt at

614
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,240
least they showed us at least its color

615
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,730
and so I was I was happy that they were

616
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,950
bold enough to be like here it is here

617
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,900
it is it's coming and we'll see more

618
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,850
which leads me to believe the next

619
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,770
Bethesda fucking press conference

620
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,030
is going to be why because we at that

621
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,830
point well year from now we are gonna

622
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,110
see star field we are gonna see Elder

623
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,540
Scrolls six if we don't see do then you

624
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,700
don't fucked up we'll probably see doom

625
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,490
eternal so you think this Bethesda was

626
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,770
good but this is gonna probably win

627
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,620
number one spot next year oh yeah

628
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,450
so yeah let's get final verdicts for a

629
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,600
Bethesda overall pretty good one this

630
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,140
one taught my charts yeah number one for

631
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,500

632
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,120
but doesn't one I noted really excited

633
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,680

634

652
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,930
show and the presentation was excellent

653

married go hey Dalton

655
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,570
eight out of ten they did what they

656
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,040
needed to they got straight to the point

657
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,570
after and you ran around and scream

658
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,090

659
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,960
[Laughter]

660
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,220
take away from that is man I'm excited

661
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,250
from fallout 76 but please take into

662
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,590
consideration people are assholes and

663
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,890
you need to plan for that yeah so so

664
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,620
fallout 76 comes out of nowhere and it

665
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,890
becomes this star child right the poster

666
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,070
boy for this year and to me if I'm gonna

667
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,049
be perfectly honest with you that felt a

668
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,320
little rushed it felt like oh fuck well

669
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,520
we don't have what enough to show we

670
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,500
don't want to show starfield we don't

671
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,820
want to show what we have for elders

672
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,890
critics I know they have stuff that they

673
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,230
could show for those but they're like we

674
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,049
want to really push we failed with

675
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,490
battle right or whatever game they were

676
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,470
making before the studio and then we

677
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,510
switched him to fallout 76 let's rush

678
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,700
them ahead of the line give them center

679
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,159
stage so to me that that that takes

680
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,690
points away from because what I was

681
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,640
expecting is I wanted star field I

682
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,429
wanted Elder Scrolls 6 I wanted doom 2 I

683
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:52,850
wanted these other things right so I was

684
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,799
gonna give it an 8 out of 10 but after

685
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,059
