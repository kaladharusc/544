1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000

good to be back in New York quick run before i start the game and lost my

3
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,660
running headphone something that these these are all sweaty

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,620
Oh see awesome run ten point oh four miles in a 734 pace and it started

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,970
pouring out halfway through my run me out

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,780
this isn't good and everything is my friend Ruby

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,870
I read my friend Ruby what

8
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,250

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,519
II don't be sad I am still be home tomorrow friday first

10
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,610
normal day of the week but I'm not running on travelin I'm especially

11
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,610
looking for the next week where I have zero traveling and Candice and Francine

12
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,220
will be back in the city

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,759
today's Friday I'm Fridays we have all team lunches where we talk about the app

14
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,830
is

15
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,130
in various ways to improve it

16
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,130
we just finished lunch it was sushi

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,870
I need to cut back on the candida but it's just so delicious

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,900
I want to do a product review today

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,910
I don't want to overexpose haven't done one in a while but i want to get into it

20
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:52,790
ok gopro incredible device one of my favorite cameras really just like

21
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,470
there's nothing in the action camera spaces as good as a GoPro nobody's

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,580
questioning that

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,100
so they sent me one of these little guys the GoPro session and i have to admit i

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,930
was extremely skeptical of it

25
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,459
mainly because the way that you focus the way that you like interact change

26
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,200
settings on this thing is only through the mobile app and I heat anything that

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,610
requires use of mobile apps mobile apps just never ever ever work

28
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,720
so many that skeptical of this thing but i have to say it is grown on me and now

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,750
this is like by far my favorite GoPro I've ever owned look at how little it is

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,480
the main beef that I have with this thing is ok it's a perfect cube so it's

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,550
the same size on all sides

32
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,650
on top of that it's black so it's the same color on all sides so I've got a

33
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,010
lot of shots that I've done this so i got a bunch of shots that I've done this

34
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,850
thing that are either shot upside down or sideways or the worst is shooting all

35
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,269
this stuff at the beach and accidentally put it in my mouth

36
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,519
lens first and then import the footage I was like what is this disgusting pink

37
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,690
bathroom staring at hunting down my throat is really yucky

38
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,500
I wish it were a different color I wish there were more demarcation 'he's

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,230
letting me know which side is up

40
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,780
and lastly because it's all black and it lives in the bottom of my backpack when

41
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,790
it's in there

42
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,480
the thing is nearly impossible to five

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,400
because everything in here is black I think you know where this is headed

44
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,260
I need to appropriate this thing i need to change its color with that it's not

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,549
that complicated

46
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,060
I'm just going to first tape over the glass on this thing

47
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,090
tape over the button and then that's trying to do it because the beauty of

48
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,349
GoPros is that they ship has pretty much indestructible object so i don't have to

49
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,069
worry about getting it in any of the tracks like I would on like an iphone or

50
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,170
something more precious

51
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,760
not bad little sloppy but that's what this tape job is done that there's the

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,590
lens perfectly covered this is the record button a little LCD screen and

53
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,849
then i went ahead and put arrows letting me know which side is up on all the

54
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:16,000
other side's on the bottom there's an ex that way added glance all know what's up

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,699
come on focus I just want to give it a hard no recommend on this here this here

56
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,039
is the tamron 10 to 24 wide angle

57
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,580
I got it because I broke like five cannon so I thought you can run a try

58
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,750
don't recommend it the thing cannot focus X on the bottom now we add a

59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,349
glance I'll always know which way is up which ways down and with the correct

60
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:42,070
direction for the lens is all right now it's time to paint it being green

61
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,820
obviously

62
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:51,890
having straight job

63
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,960
multiple colors are oh hey looky here

64
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,730
I don't know that was room no filled it up Phil DeFranco youtube extraordinary

65
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,780

66
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,160

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,560
doing a little uh spray paint video here

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,730
that's awesome i'm sorry i'm a fanboy for a second so you never see this day

69
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,600
not in person ohhh this school you should probably know Phil is if you

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,010
don't already feel here is a little bit of a legend on youtube

71
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,570
he's been you - he's been like he is like the original youtuber he's making

72
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:33,410
video since 2000 sets it 2006 two billion views

73
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,980
yes I could too . for I think that's crazy

74
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,400
but you didn't interrupt my spray paint i did I messed everything up

75
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,520
I think it's coming along pretty well it doesn't i don't feel like i'm dying from

76
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,210
fumes anymore

77
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,210
now the paint comes off heat proof camera

78
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,449
it's going to pour 11

79
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,819
they look at how quickly the files are moving okay yeah you know what

80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
yeah

81
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:11,559
you get some yeah where they going

82
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,180
but it looks like a little what I see on stage in like an hour and a half we're

83
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,240
gonna take me now we have had a storm like this in a while

84
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,550
so what we're doing this for your channel yeah I i want to ask you this

85
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,880
because I think I think your answer will actually be pretty helpful

86
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,410
so I have to ask Casey where do you get value in your life

87
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,590
this is a pleasure sir good luck and don't get struck by lightning out there

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,800
I said it before I'll say it again one of my favorite parts of doing this blog

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,460
is getting to meet new people all the time and Phil definitely falls into that

90
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,220
in a big way

91
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,610
it's pretty late i'm still in the office I'm leaving now but so I felt like a

92
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,970
dozen coats on this thing and this is super high quality spray paint but it

93
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,120
will not stick to the GoPro it comes right off

94
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,039
how can go pros be so indestructible that they're impervious to our high

95
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,419
quality spray paint

96
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:28,180
well done go pro well done forever as a situation outside

97
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,000
yeah

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,050
yeah

99
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,000
yeah

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
yeah

101
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,790
yeah

102
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
ok

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:59,070
figure out what's going on down there

104
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,000

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,030
