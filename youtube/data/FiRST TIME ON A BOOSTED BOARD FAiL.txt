00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm not filming my runs anymore for this blog but if you are interested in

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,170
running

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,759
I post my stat - every day on twitter follow me there and I try to have like a

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,090
little backing for the people that are interested in running every morning on

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,090
Twitter after my run

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:39,950
yeah

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,560
I love that song

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:53,430
down today's Friday the week is over excited about this weekend

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:08,040
got some fun stuff planned couple of quick housekeeping things number one

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,580
I've decided to switch back from this super fancy expensive

11
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,890
well here's the box sure microphone that looks like this

12
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,890
the sound quality is not as good as the road microphone in the end like it's the

13
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,600
quality of the sound that matters

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
and this kid just sounds

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,220
this thing just sounds so much better so

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,300
also on the reason why this sounds so bad right now is that I don't have a

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,210
microphone that camera at all because they're both right here

18
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,450
this I kid you not

19
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,350
the industry term for this is a dead cat a lot of people are complaining about

20
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,550
yesterday's blog how windy like how much wind noise there was i will be using

21
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,080
this from now on

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,160
don't think for a second I don't realize just how absurd this looks

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,780
I know that there's a difference between this picture and this picture

24
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,310
that's because this camera is just like a cannon rebel it's like their least

25
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,890
expensive camera that shoots video ever

26
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,160
and this 70d which is a much better camera but I broke the audio ports on

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,030
this camera so i'm using this camera but i don't know if you can tell a

28
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,900
difference

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,990
yeah

30
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,040
this showed up in the mail today

31
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,900
i'm ninety-nine percent sure i know it is boosted to back from the shot

32
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,490
ha ha

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:02,690
so what I just got my thing - Justin you're just not Justin Bieber tip so now

34
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,690

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,379

36
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,269

37
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:25,190

38
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,190

39
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,730

40
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,909
you look at work it's you so something you should know about Oscar is that he

41
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:44,060
was a what national champions here for of an Eastern Conference champion in

42
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,730
anything

43
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,409
he is an Eastern Conference skin champion skier so he should be more than

44
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,030
capable you're here for me

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,030
well this is tight

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,160

47
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,260
how does it feel fantastic we're just so happy for you want to like rip on these

48
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,530
things and be like I hate those knuckleheads tearing up the streets with

49
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,650
Eric equipment but then once you get on it

50
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,650
best thing ever look

51
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,830
ice cream headache

52
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,960
yeah

53
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:07,310
yeah

54
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:24,430
I knew it was an inevitability but I've lost Oscar

55
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,550
you know you seen Oscar

56
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,550
he was on the other Bruce keyboard like completely lost him

57
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,039
I made it you remind me of the kind of thing I want to be like you don't need

58
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,690
motors to have fun but then you go out there like jet skiing or just like this

59
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,650
is so fun and so I feel so in the moment that I can't think about anything else

60
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,370
yeah have fun and hang out and let you out

61
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:59,090
I love that guy Oscar and I work together for like eight years 10 years

62
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,470
and now the kind of we do our own thing but he's an awesome person

63
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,090
