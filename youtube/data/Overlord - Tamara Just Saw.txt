00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,369
overlord and I have not been so tense

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,359
okay in such a good way in so huh yeah I

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,010
think we're both kind of crashing now I

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,930
feel I feel like completely drained from

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,869
like yeah just feeling the intensity for

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,359
like two hours or you know like BR being

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,460
like tensed up and I put yeah in the

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,840
best possible way it's the new

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,489
corrections Hank JJ Abrams he produced

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,230
it okay yeah it's basically Wolfenstein

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,840
yeah I went into it super excited and we

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,280
were walking around talking is like oh

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,140
we're gonna go see overlord and everyone

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,579
was like oh it's getting good reviews so

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,190
weird and I thought like well sure I

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,660
isn't everybody excited to see this

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,910
movie yeah yeah I didn't hear much about

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,680
it other than seeing the trailers yeah

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,570
in my mind I thought it was just gonna

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,580
be like a really intense Wolfenstein it

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,200
I think that's exactly what it was yeah

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
absolutely I had my expectations were

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,250
met I think like it was exactly what I

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,070
wanted to get out of it yeah which was

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,799
great and in some ways like it was like

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,060
I think it was a few things I was saying

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,409
like I would have liked to see just a

33
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,780
little more of this but there was enough

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,729
other things till I kind of filled in

35
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,759
the parts that might have been missing

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,020
there i was like no i didn't care like

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,960
it was yeah if the movie itself flowed

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,060
so well the characters were great like

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,860
the action was so palpable is this like

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,110
as a war movie it's super awesome and

41
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,590
intense yeah and then like when the

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,560
horror stuff or like you know the

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,820
suspense kind of kicks in then it's like

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,579
that's amazing to like it's such a great

45
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,829
blend it's so yeah yeah you're saying

46
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,360
like if you went in not knowing that

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,070
there's the horror aspect you just be

48
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,590
blown away by this incredible war movie

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,119
and the first sequence when they're on

50
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,799
the plane anywhere needs to take their

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,150
dive into their area

52
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,940
to be in to take down the church it was

53
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,600
the most nerve-wracking horrifying plane

54
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,670
sequence I've ever seen in a war movie

55
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,410
we said you thought I said it you feel

56
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,670
like you're on one of those for do ya

57
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,250
right you'd be like oh like this needs

58
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,790
removing

59
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,110
yes kind of you know you can feel a

60
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,000
concussion of blasts and stuff going on

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,150
yeah yeah yeah it's super intense it's

62
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,030
like I was it's kind of like the aerial

63
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,550
version of Saving Private Ryan when

64
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,870
they're getting off I mean they're like

65
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,220
on the boats and stuff like that it was

66
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,630
just like you know yeah so yeah so

67
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,600
amazing war movie and then you start

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,890
getting into like the disgusting science

69
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,290
hostel in scientists it was so great

70
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,100
it's so creepy it was so I guess I was

71
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,590
gonna say there was a sense of humor

72
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,540
there was no humor in the movie right

73
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,260
right

74
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,880
but like especially at the end with like

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,780
the massive like boss fight you get a

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,590
sense of like it's fun maybe that's not

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,660
the word no I think yeah no I think it

78
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,090
is I I had like a blast legends movie

79
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,340
and that was like what I wanted like the

80
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,440
characters were worse the stereotypes

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,540
that you see in every type of this movie

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,910
like or a movie or kind of horror movie

83
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,239
you know yeah um I didn't care it was

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,380
like knowing or like all right well I

85
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,000
know who the characters are yeah and

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,250
you're you're immediately thrust into

87
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,550
you know no time for a beginning yeah no

88
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,050
time establishing the characters and

89
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,390
they're so good at being those Carrie

90
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,750
yes

91
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,670
no but all the performances are great

92
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,530
yeah yeah like the the lead the evil

93
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,750
Nazi whatever like it's so great and

94
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,730
creepy and stuff for all of like the

95
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,590
intense moments that are like super

96
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,650
action and like super thrilling the some

97
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,400
of the very slow kind of like unsettling

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,799
moments our Sartre are done so well also

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,600
yeah where

100
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,519
yeah there's such a great blend between

101
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,739
those elements like it takes a walk the

102
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,600
first half of the movie is is during the

103
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,000
war

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,550
basically and then you start getting

105
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,950
hints of the those elements of like the

106
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,630
evil science you know the Nazis are

107
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,650
experimenting and stuff and the war

108
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,340
stuff is so intense and unsettling that

109
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,860
like and I wasn't like just get to the

110
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,020
castle or get to those people not me get

111
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,590
you there like yeah yeah yeah I would

112
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,500
have been so fine to watch a full movie

113
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,030
of these war characters going through

114
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,980
the war yeah yeah and then you get like

115
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,710
this horror aspects that are truly scary

116
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,540
it's like the true definition of

117
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,050
horrific like it or I'm in such a fun

118
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,900
way is so flat about myself tense but

119
00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:00,160
also like grinning from ear to ear I

120
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
feel like I've been wanting to see this

121
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,180
movie too for so long even before I saw

122
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,770
the trailer like I wasn't on camera I'm

123
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,870
like I'm like a fan of the whole like

124
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,570
zombie Nazi kind of genre loved it and

125
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,820
and I've never seen it done really

126
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,050
really well and this was like the first

127
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,790
one that was like yes this is what I've

128
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,530
been waiting to see I could see how this

129
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,080
genre could get very poorly made yeah

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
and I think you like like the fact that

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,620
it has a smell like GG tiramisu never

132
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,630
has a big budget behind it you know yeah

133
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,300
but it doesn't lend itself to being a

134
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,830
big-budget movie like it doesn't feel

135
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,510
like a big-budget movie in that sense

136
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,990
yeah the sets that they were using

137
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,540
amazing there's one point where they

138
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,580
come into the village and they've just

139
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,680
captured the girl and they're like bring

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,080
us to safety and it looks like if you

141
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,520
guys have played the even within it

142
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,320
looks like the beginning of that when

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,790
you're going up into the castle of that

144
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,390
and it's so beautiful did you find this

145
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,060
I don't know where are you filming this

146
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,190
movie it's amazing and then like the

147
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,590
actors are great like the Kurt Russell

148
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,110
son right well I just like hopefully I'm

149
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,420
like I didn't know that he was

150
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,060
it was like this guy's reminds me of

151
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,280
Kurt Russell like you know so he has a

152
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,800
Kurt Russell about him yeah yeah I just

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
might think I'm like this gotta be like

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,740
a Greek like Snake Plissken they were

155
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:24,270
gonna remake it this guy should be the

156
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,190
two leads yeah we're just really

157
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,770
everybody's performance was salad like I

158
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,380
was like a super bought into everybody's

159
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,180
performance everybody did a great job

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,280
yeah and like you said like it's not

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,500
really funny like there are like comedic

162
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,230
moments but there are but it is like fun

163
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,660
like you're kind of comedic moments yeah

164
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,340
and the horror thickness that's not in

165
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,490
the sequences is it so outrageous yeah

166
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,610
that you can only really just like have

167
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,160
fun with it yeah because it's so it's a

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,660
really difficult movie to watch in like

169
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,570
a really great way it's very its graphic

170
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,900
and it's intense and terrifying and so

171
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,150
it's riveting like where you're still

172
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,950
like you're staring at the movie because

173
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,480
you don't want to miss anything a second

174
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,980
of it yeah yeah like all my notes I

175
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,720
couldn't even read them we're driving

176
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,710
over here because just like but like do

177
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,440
you find like fun in the horror they

178
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,030
very easily could have been like well

179
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,830
that's because it's kind of like an

180
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,080
outrageous kind of concept in everywhere

181
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,870
we know whatever it would be easy to

182
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,230
make it sort of campy and like the

183
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,170
acting to be like a little like wink at

184
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,760
the camera but because all the

185
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,070
characters played it so straight like it

186
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,130
kind of made it even even better I don't

187
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,330
know yeah there was this like it was

188
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,160
like everybody's given like a hundred

189
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,130
percent yeah it is shot dark and

190
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,100
sequences it is shot very much like kind

191
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,660
of a grindhouse movie where some of its

192
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,730
like it's really like you're some scenes

193
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,140
are really dark and in shadow and it's

194
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,180
super gritty and everything's wet and

195
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,700
yeah yeah you know has that gritty on

196
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,480
easy feel like you know like well then

197
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
set design

198
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,650
and after our directions something that

199
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,660
was great going in I just wanted to see

200
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,180
some creepy-ass Nazi experiments okay

201
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,130
you get a great scene with that the

202
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,729
creatures that they make are so

203
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,410
compelling there's like one chase scene

204
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,740
especially between the lead woman and

205
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,930
one of these creatures who she was great

206
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,930
to me there is so often like with what

207
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,789
the female lead they feel like they're

208
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:30,110
just pigeon-holed in there because they

209
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,899
need to be in there but like hers didn't

210
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,669
her character like helped progress the

211
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,969
story my note says one word flamethrower

212
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,839
she is such a badass

213
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,070
and that chase scene was so excited I

214
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,990
felt myself getting attached to these

215
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,670
characters that again there was no like

216
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,080
buildup of who they are you did right

217
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,279
you're straight and you know they're

218
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,839
archetypes that their place that they

219
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,940
are yeah but then they they play those

220
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,350
characters so well they you don't care

221
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,730
the end you know it like you know you're

222
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,660
like alright good I know these

223
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,610
characters now let's go totally she get

224
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,279
into very very mild spoilers I at one

225
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,290
point one of the characters passes away

226
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,320
and I was like touched and they were sad

227
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
about that and then that turns into a

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,660
really creepy and so well done sequence

229
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,450
um that was just yeah the whole time I

230
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,279
was just like I kept like very loudly

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,040
breathing out I don't think I just like

232
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,980
