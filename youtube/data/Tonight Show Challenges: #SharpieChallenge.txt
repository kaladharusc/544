-All right, so, last week,
I came up with something called

6
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,477
&quot;The Sharpie Challenge,&quot; okay?

7
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,379
It's in honor of Movember,

which helps raise awareness
for men's health issues.

Basically, you flip a Sharpie
up in air, you catch in midair,

10
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,487
then use it to draw a mustache
on your face.

I did one myself.
