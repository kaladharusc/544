1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,419
hey guys it's been a while since I did

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,629
one of these late-night videos and yeah

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,849
I kind of miss it and it always helps me

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,500
gets my thoughts together and this one

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,350
you know it kind of kind of surprised me

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,670
that I needed to just because like I've

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,910
been feeling really down lately I'm not

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,220
a hundred percent sure why contextually

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,830
it doesn't make a lot of sense logically

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,529
I like it's weird to me

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,840
because things are really good right now

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,790
you know things are going well with

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,629
videos I feel like I've been able to

14
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,700
have a lot of opportunities to connect

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,559
with my family to go on the last leg of

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,219
the tour

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,050
you know the cloak launch everything's

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,829
going well and yet like I can't help but

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,449
feel like something's missing you know

20
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,309
and I always got to hesitate because I'm

21
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,140
all like am i whining about something am

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,480
I just whining to whine am i complaining

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,370
about something that's not really worth

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,920
complaining about but like I can't shake

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,049
this feeling not this feeling that

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,909
something's wrong but this feeling that

27
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,560
I don't know like I'm waiting for

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,330
something more I'm not really one for

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,670
sitting still a lot of the time I'm

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,619
always on the move I can never stay in

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,299
the same place for too long I can never

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,860
stay in the same situation for too long

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,930
I can never commit to anything for too

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,880
long because I have this incessant need

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,060
to keep moving forward and so when it

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,189
comes down to my life if there's ever a

37
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,280
time when I'm stuck doing the same thing

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
I often get antsy but this is different

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,530
because like I've got so many different

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,570
things going on then I thought I would

41
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,659
have been you know a lot happier than I

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,720
am and so I mean in reality I don't

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,780
really know why and I don't know what to

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,659
make of it I have I have ideas about

45
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,640
what I want and ideas about things that

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,920
I need and ideas about things that are

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,960
better for the future but you know the

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,340
future is all I can think about these

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,610
days my future everyone's future

50
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,150
humanity's future like my thoughts are

51
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,960
constantly on the future

52
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,170
cuz coming up this will be the last few

53
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,420
months of my life before my birthday

54
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,200
next June where I'm in my 20s and not

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,520
that I'm afraid of getting older I'm

56
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,600
actually looking forward to getting

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,350
older like I just don't know what my 30s

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,280
are gonna be defined by you know I've

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,230
gotten to this point in my life in the

60
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,690
success on this channel by being so

61
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,510
unbelievably sure of what I needed to do

62
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,400
it was really obvious you know make

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,730
videos you know try to help people raise

64
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,710
money for charity do what I can to

65
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,360
better the world and yet I don't know is

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,540
it wrong of me to say like it doesn't

67
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,670
feel like enough that it doesn't feel

68
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,590
like enough but it feels like I could be

69
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,770
doing more you know not that it's enough

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,320
for my own self-satisfaction but it's

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,400
not enough because like I think I know

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
my potential I'd like to think I know my

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,980
potential anyway I want it I want to

74
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,410
like I don't always push myself farther

75
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,880
and I always want to try to improve

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,620
myself every day but I've reached this

77
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,670
point where I realize it there's a

78
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,460
possibility that I could do a lot more

79
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,760
with my life and I don't know what it is

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,110
I don't know I don't know the specifics

81
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,210
I don't know where where that would be

82
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,040
or what that would be I don't know what

83
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,990
form it would take but I just feel I

84
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,060
feel like everything that I've done so

85
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,780
far in a lot of ways is is is incredible

86
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,210
and I'm incredibly proud of what we've

87
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,340
built in terms of this community now I'm

88
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,410
incredibly proud of what we've done

89
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,000
together and I'm incredibly proud of

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,480
that but at the same time it's like I

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,750
want to do more you know I want to do

92
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,460
more I don't want to do more in terms of

93
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,700
like private things that are band-aid

94
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,680
fixes on a lot of problems I want to do

95
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,920
more to actually change the world I want

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,920
to do more to really inspire people who

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,510
maybe feel like they have no hope or

98
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,210
move humanity in some big way and and

99
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,250
that's

100
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,080
it seems almost ridiculous for me to say

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,570
out loud but I want to I want to inspire

102
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,900
change in in more people I want to push

103
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,690
people towards a better future like I've

104
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,910
always said I wanted to leave behind

105
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,550
more than I take I want to leave a

106
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,160
better world than I came into I want to

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,440
improve the world as much as I can as a

108
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,100
human being I want to do that and it's

109
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
easy to say that I want to do that but I

110
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,370
think that the thing that's getting me

111
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,830
down right now is like I keep saying it

112
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,480
and I keep saying it over and over and I

113
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,070
keep thinking and I keep thinking about

114
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:08,660
it in and a11 my life to mean something

115
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,460
and it means something right now and I

116
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,200
think the juxtaposition is that it does

117
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,560
mean something but it still doesn't feel

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,950
like I'm doing enough you know and I

119
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,510
know there will be people that say you

120
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,940
know I I do more than enough but you

121
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,220
know I want to see like I'm bored I'm

122
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,410
bored I'm sitting around a lot I'm I'm

123
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,510
waiting I'm I'm just kind of like

124
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,570
letting the clock tick by and I'm not

125
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,210
I'm not that kind of creature I can't do

126
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,700
that a Kansas City idly by while waiting

127
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,910
for the world to move past me I can't do

128
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,950
it physically can't there's a lot of

129
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,090
things that I can do and there's a lot

130
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,560
of things left for me to do in this

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,740
world but I think I can't just sit idly

132
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,160
by I want to a Craven my craves change

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,970
I crave moving mountains I crave doing

134
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,240
as much as I possibly can I crave

135
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,210
working myself to the bones I love it I

136
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,520
love everything about it I love the

137
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,770
potential I love the failure of it I

138
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,470
love trying things and not succeeding I

139
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,500
love that I love the experience of it it

140
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,570
just makes me feel alive and I want to

141
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,040
do something that does some kind of

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,040
tangible good more than what we've done

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,479
so far you know and no this doesn't mean

144
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,310
that I'm going to be quitting YouTube it

145
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,020
anytime soon like that's never been a

146
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,400
part of this the

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
the whole process behind these videos

148
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,780
it's just that I I think out loud so I

149
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,430
can try to get a better understanding of

150
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,229
what what I really want because I know

151
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,199
that it all ties back into a community

152
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,380
in one way or another what we have here

153
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,789
is an amazing thing there are negatives

154
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,039
to YouTube and the Internet in general

155
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,800
and social media in general but there

156
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,180
are positives to it is not an inherently

157
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,160
evil structure but the way it can be

158
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,500
used in the way the communities can be

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,919
band together can be but there's also

160
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,510
good and I think we should consider

161
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,229
ourselves to be very lucky to have this

162
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,130
opportunity to be at the center of all

163
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,370
this change when the world's changing

164
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,620
and the worlds in chaos and it can seem

165
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,259
dark and it can seem dreary but I think

166
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,639
we should still consider ourselves lucky

167
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,400
because we can be the catalyst to change

168
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,590
the world for the better and I think

169
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,010
that's an incredible thing I just don't

170
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,479
know what like that's the thing I just

171
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:59,550
don't know what but I want to so it's

172
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,400
it's just got me down because I don't

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,590
know I feel like I'm not living up to my

174
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,330
potential but at the same time it's not

175
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,370
really down in terms of like it's

176
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,289
impacting my day-to-day life it's just

177
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,820
making me think constantly about what

178
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,449
the future holds I already feel better I

179
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,400
think that's the thing about feeling me

180
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,900
rambling into the camera like this is

181
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,470
it's old-school way of me doing this is

182
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,669
it I don't know just helps me think

183
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,289
clearly about what's really important

184
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,610
and I know for a fact what's really

185
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,340
important is you guys

186
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,190

187
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,590

188
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,510
just cuz I say I'm a little down doesn't

189
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,010
mean that I'm incredibly depressed it

190
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,930
just means that I'm searching for

191
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,100
purpose and that's not a bad thing

192
