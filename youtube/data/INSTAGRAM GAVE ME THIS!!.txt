94
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,690
I'm really excited about that we haven't had a good snowstorm in New York City in

95
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,710
years

96
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,710

97
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,440
provided my plate doesn't get cancelled

98
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,240
if you think you have anything hundred percent positively absolutely the first

99
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,440

100
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,980

101
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
yeah

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:27,010
yeah

103
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,350
plane was supposed to take off 45 minutes ago

104
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,470
getting a little worried

105
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,440
if we don't take off tonight there's no way

106
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,870
in san francisco for several good because this snowstorm and they say it's

107
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,620
me kind of the lungs but it's gonna be told by yeah

108
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,180
small computer and as many of you are aware sometimes when there's computer

109
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,020
probs the best thing to do is powered on the computer then restart it again

110
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,230
so that's what we're going to do so thanks for patience is really turning it

111
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,350
off and then turn it back on again

112
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,250
if you are at the front door still open so if you decide you reply to

113
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,440
discontinue the flight to deplane

114
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,470
you're welcome to do it so it's not just let the agent know i'll provide you with

115
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,490
other status updated 30 minutes or sooner hopefully if information changes

116
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,280
thanks for patients that we've done that it looks like that the the issue was

117
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,880
result so they're going to fill out the paperwork and and we should be ready to

118
