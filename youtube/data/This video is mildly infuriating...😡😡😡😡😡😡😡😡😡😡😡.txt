1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,850
Whenever there is a great unjustice

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,630
happening; a criminal walks freely.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,820
I dropped my sandwich

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,920
an animal dies for no good reason

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,740
that's when I put my foot down, and I say

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,980
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,400
I get mildly irritated when these things happen.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
people dying from war;

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,860
Clipping your nails a slightly too long, so it feels weird.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,349
These are all mildly irritating things that makes us go

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,529
Ughhhhhhhhh

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,640
Sometimes that anger just gets too built up, and you need to let it go.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,260
You need to move past it

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,820
by really letting out a fierce

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,309
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm with you 100%.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,910
There is just too much injustice in this world.

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,600
So let's explore it together with other people and see what we can find.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,540
(ANGRY MONKEY)

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,850
My stress ball just exploded that is honestly so annoying

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,010
Because then you gotta clean all that up. I think it happened once one of the stressed boobs

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,690
Oh, yeah, it did happen to Ken

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,630
He asked me what the f I was taking a picture of I told him I was taking a pic of the douchebag that needs

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,360
to occupy two handicap spots to eat some fries is it weird that I would do this to say as well

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,340
I mean if there's no handicap th- (laugh)

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,430
I'm just saying if there's no handicaps

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,259
Why did the spot needs to be open I can clearly just move out of the way listen

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:39,369
There's only one spot when I collect my mail that is free and it's always just a handicapped spot where am I?

29
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:43,330
Supposed to park this is not my infuriating

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,470
Actually, you know what it is ERR! for the wrong reason stop discriminating at people parking at handicapped spot

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,030
There's nothing wrong with it

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,200
There's a stigma-

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,240
spend hours completing this mildly infuriating puzzle, and now I can't

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,380
Yuh. I guess that's mildly infuriating. What do you want me to say? This is pathetic

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,160
This is all that you have to bother your life and take one step in my shoes

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:14,050
And you would feel real pain. you would feel real my lead in whatever five bananas. Well maybe

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,959
One of the bananas isn't a banana have you thought about that before judging your anger?

38
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,700
Maybe you should think critically like me before you LETasdhas

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:32,080
Let your emotions pity thoughts rule over your mind and body. I haven't agreed with a single one so far (laugh)

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,540
I thought this would be mildly infuriating..

41
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,950
These pencils suck

42
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,230
Then don't buy them what the hell all these crybabies

43
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,000
Jesus Christ.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,910
this dad mailed a container of sliced mangoes to his daughter in college

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:59,300
(O__O)

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,380
ERRRRRRR!!1!1!!!

47
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,700
This is not interesting (chuckle)

48
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,790
make me so angry

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,590
ERRR!1!11!

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,759
Stupid daughter ERR!!... I don't care about your sliced mangoes

51
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,430
EER !!!  EER !!! EER !!

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,269
There's more important information that I could fill up my mind with

53
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,150
ERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,820
Stupid pat- father and mango. I don't caaaaaare

55
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,200
I don't care about this article from BuzzFeed.

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,160
having screenshots saved in a screenshot

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,600
Does that actually happen..?

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
that is so infuriating

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,470
ERrYY!!!!     ERRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

60
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,470
I'm not gonna read this post

People who whore out sus- unsus- (go back to school felix)

63
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,220
people who whore out unsuspecting relatives for virtual numbers my daughter does not think I can get

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:55,050

Anything just does... these kids just think anything deserves likes these days

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,610
How about 98 likes to kill your grandad, then I will like it then it would be interesting don't waste my time

69
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,950
ERRRRRRRRRR ERRRRR GAAAHHHH!!!!!

70
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:22,049

71
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:28,668
theonly thing infuriating about this is that Dollar Shave Club won't sponsor me. What is up with that?

72
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,520
ERRR!

ERRRR!!

77
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,200
I was hoping I could wait 60 more seconds ERR!!.. that's so annoying

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,710
smash 399

79
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,970
Quaker Oatmeal

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,990
advertises

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,590
35% smaller portions

83
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,640
Lower sugar Wow

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,980
That's brilliant, I hate UPS just a little bit more every day

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:19,340
I'm working from home down stairs, and I'm hard of hearing please ring the doorbell or yell. I'm here. Thank you

86
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,490
Sorry, we missed you yeah, they loved handing out these goddamn things. I don't even want the package

87
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,830
This is why I park at the handicapped spot at the post office

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,430
I need my revenge oh, I know something that really irritates

89
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,450
commenters

90
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:43,550
If I have my headphones not balanced what y'all mad about today Professor X could move anything with his mind

91
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,950
So why not his F-ing legs?

92
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,890
This is what I'm talking about the handicapped spot, you know what's actually mildly infuriating about this

93
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:00,940
It's the amount of time people spend talking about comic book heroes, and why would that doesn't make any sense.

94
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:08,020
GOD I just realized that Professor X can't have sex it never occurred to me that his d doesn't work either F

95
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,660
Man, I'm surprised. He's such a positive guy

96
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,149
knowing that he hasn't had sex in years

97
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:16,700
now im just sad

98
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,550
I'm not infuriated

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:25,880
You know what that is infuriating this guy has been talking on the phone for 10 minutes with this flashlight on

100
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,479
just tell him excuse me sir your flashlight is on you are burning more battery and

101
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,419
Blinding other people is that so hard instead you just take an Alford photo to upload and reddit

102
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,169
*chuckle* look at these guys

103
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,800

107
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300

108
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,300
2 0

109
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,900
2 0 4? *chuckle*

110
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,949
*clap clap clap clap*

111
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:03,769
Congratulations the American school system you have outdone yourself yet again, but that's my dad's middle name

112
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:11,169
What is your father's middle name Paul enter an answer that is at least five characters clearly his name is not Paul

113
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,609
It's something else

114
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,999
Clearly your dad is lying to you

115
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,289
YEE !! EHHHH!!

116
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,279
Sorry

117
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,860
That was a bit much. I am I do apologize. I was staring at it all flight

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,360
Oh, she's wearing. She's wearing the right headphones in the last

119
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,009
It's another thing huh I had if I have my headphones not balanced as well

120
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,899
It's all people comment about in the comment section thinking they're like so

121
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:57,169
So quirky about their OCD when you really you're just a bunch of crybabies

122
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:02,779
Do you have such a perfect life that this literally mild inconveniences

123
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:17,749
This is bothering you. This is bothering you in my ball. I'm sorry am I bothering you right now. Am I bothering you

124
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:24,019
Maybe she was facing the seat the whole time

125
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:30,579
Why can't they design their cables better, and it's just so annoying stop buying Apple products you dummies

126
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:36,229
Do you think it's impossible to make them more sturdy and better you think they're not just trying to make you buy new cables

127
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,649
You think there's a reason because if you plug in other?

128
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:44,269
Off-brand ones Apple won't even approve them you have to buy their own ones

129
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:51,259
Stop buying Apple products, and then I'll buy into your stuff crying this this whole video is just me getting hankering

130
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:57,170
For the complete wrong reason being stuck behind this for miles, just go around

131
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,209
They said there's this you can nearly just go around. What's the problem? Oh?

132
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,370
Like you know both are their speeds if one is going

133
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,910
Half a mile per hour quicker, then it shouldn't take miles

134
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:22,880
For you to wait get there wouldn't it you dum-dum scum bum booty, but I watch two for tonight

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:39,680

136
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,370
This lady watching a beach wedding they put up a yellow police tape all around the beach

137
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,720
Yet somehow this random lady in the blue swimsuit

138
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,950
still

139
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,610
fascinated

140
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,430
Someone needs to shoot that that woman, this is why I'm for the Second Amendment

141
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:08,589
Why why do I need an account just to look at Pinterest? This is by far the highest one?

142
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,529
Why are people using Pinterest then that's my real question?

143
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:21,740
Yeah, you search for Google Images you get a Pintrest result. Oh ok apparently. I won't view this picture

144
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,360
Sukkah yeah

145
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,800
This better be good the most tense 13 days of the Cold War occurred during the event known as stiff

146
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,010
