1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,519
the black hole is one of those movies I

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,840
always heard a lot of people talk about

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,080
but not usually very favorably and after

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,000
having finally see it I can definitely

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,730
see why it's Disney's attempt at trying

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,130
to be every popular sci-fi film that's

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,260
ever come out in fact you can point

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,240
practically scene by seeing what movie

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,010
they're trying to replicate first it's

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,630
alien then it's Belle star Galactica

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,970
that's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,219
then it's Star Wars and then finally

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,590
it's 2001 the space odyssey in trying to

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,329
combine them all together you get a film

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,489
that has very little identity it's just

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,860
kind of a huge mess but at the same time

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,530
I can't say it was entirely bad there

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,390
are some good things about it a couple

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,210
maybe it starts off with an expedition

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,920
in space where they come across a craft

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,480
that apparently has been lost for years

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,910
a scientist and his robot standing on

23
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,309
the edge of the black hole he claims the

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,559
rest of the crew died yeah that's it and

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,300
that he's been spending his time trying

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,680
to figure out how he can go through the

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,270
black hole and come out the other end

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,339
he thinks he's finally found a way and

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,930
everybody's intrigued to see if he can

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,790
actually do it the downside is there's a

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,520
lot of mysterious things going on his

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,470
robot crew almost seems a little too

33
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,509
human and it's just this all-around

34
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,340
threatening tone where the people feel

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,009
more like prisoners than they do guess

36
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,150
secrets are discovered sides are

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,920
declared and it's a battle to see who

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,229
can get off the ship alive but this part

39
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,210
about the movie strangely enough is its

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,369
atmosphere and don't get me wrong a lot

41
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,619
of the effects are not very good they're

42
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,939
supposed to be flying around in space

43
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,829
but it just kind of looks like they're

44
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,890
standing around and the keying is really

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,950
really bad I mean look at that can you

46
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,570
take a guess where the real film is and

47
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,759
where the map painting begins yeah it's

48
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,979
pretty painful but it almost makes up

49
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,600
for it with this gigantic feeling of

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,090
dread throughout the first half

51
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,500
everybody knows something sneaky is

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,880
going on but they can't quite put their

53
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,649
finger on what it is they're just

54
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,180
waiting for a trigger moment to whip out

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,350
their guns and start defending

56
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,149
themselves but there never really seems

57
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,939
to be a reason to plus it has maybe one

58
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,730
of the scariest robots of all time

59
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,930
Maximillian yeah doesn't sound very

60
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,940
scary but whenever he's on screen all

61
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,490
the music stops all the sound goes dead

62
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,860
and you just feel this thing's presence

63
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,990
he even gets in a few decent kills every

64
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,770
once in a while

65
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:25,810
look at this see Jesus Christ for Disney

66
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,000
that's pretty gruesome for such a simple

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,040
design I love how uncomfortable I feel

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,780
whenever he's on screen he doesn't even

69
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,450
say anything it's just I don't know it's

70
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,760
just this presence they create aside

71
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,650
from that the evil scientist is pretty

72
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,360
good Ernest Borgnine adds a little bit

73
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,730
of comedy but all the other actors are

74
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,980
under this really weird stoic way of

75
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,930
acting and it just comes across as so

76
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,030
wooden even great actors like Robbie

77
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,370
McDowell and Anthony Perkins you can

78
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,900
sense they're trying to get a good

79
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,370
performance out of this but there's just

80
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,620
so little to work with there's a lot of

81
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,970
elements they throw in that don't really

82
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,170
seem to go anywhere either

83
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,860
for example this woman's telepathic it's

84
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,959
useless there's totally no point to it

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
at all she communicates with the robot

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,500
at some point but what they don't have

87
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,720
communicators walkie-talkies cellphones

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,130
none of that is created in the future

89
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,500
the ending itself is just a huge

90
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,549
clusterfuck

91
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,280
it makes us in images of Heaven and Hell

92
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,610
and yeah I don't know why I don't know

93
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,380
what it's trying to say but it's not

94
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,870
quite like 2001 where the vagueness is

95
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,730
part of the intrigue it's more like

96
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,530
we're obviously trying to say something

97
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,540
you just can't figure out what it is and

98
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,799
based on the rest of the film you can

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,239
tell that whatever it had to say

100
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,310
probably wasn't that intelligent or

101
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,440
interesting look at this this incredibly

102
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,630
fake asteroid fields going by and one

103
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,700
even crashes into the ship why the hell

104
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,709
is it going that slowly they're whizzing

105
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,810
by at incredible speeds before and now

106
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,220
it's giving time for the characters to

107
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,470
cross a bridge right in front of it it's

108
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,060
like a school crossing it just looks

109
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,280
ridiculous but I do give credit to the

110
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,440
film that it was at least trying to be a

111
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,540
little smarter than your average sci-fi

112
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,079
film

113
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,600
yeah Star Wars in 2001 were big hits and

114
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,430
everybody was trying to copy them and so

115
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,900
is this film but a lot of it's very

116
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,750
dialogue focus not much action not much

117
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,489
running around I guess I kind of like

118
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,079
the fact that at least made an attempt

119
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,360
to be smarter it just didn't seem to pay

120
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,180
off so yeah I guess like what a lot of

121
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,769
people say it's not a very

122
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,989
film even by the so bad it's good

123
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,509
standards it's still not very good but I

124
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,759
am glad I saw few of those scenes that

125
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,830
created some pretty decent atmosphere

126
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,419
even if it was really fake looking

127
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,610
definitely not one of Disney's best you

128
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:49,150
can probably just give it a pass so a

129
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,349
lot of people have been requesting

130
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,990
something wicked this way comes which is

131
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,310
interesting because when the film came

132
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,680
out it was a major bomb it didn't even

133
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,169
make half of its money back and truth be

134
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,210
told I never even heard of it until I

135
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,400
was like maybe in the ninth grade

136
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,080
remember it's being shown in my schools

137
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,940
and understanding of Ray Bradbury's work

138
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,400
and all the kids were so excited

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,690
Something Wicked This Way Comes oh I

140
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,400
love that movie I was kind of wondering

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
how I missed it as I thought I saw the

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,360
really dark eighties kids films that

143
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,400
came out around that time I say this to

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,949
point out that this is not a film I grew

145
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,380
up with so I'm not really gonna let the

146
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,960
nostalgia factor get in the way but that

147
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,940
doesn't necessarily make it a bad film I

148
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,560
just don't think I love it like

149
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
everybody else loves it

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,190
the movie centers around two boys one

151
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,870
named Will Holloway and the other named

152
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,810
get this Jim nightshade God how does

153
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,430
Brad berry find these incredible names

154
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,259
they're often seen around Will's father

155
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,180
who's an old librarian and they spend

156
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,560
most their time just getting into

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
trouble all sorts of difficult boy stuff

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,090
but then one night a carnival arrives I

159
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,279
mean literally one night it's all put

160
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,569
together in a matter of just a few

161
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,219
minutes and this has been put together

162
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,340
by dr. dark played by Jonathan Pryce he

163
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,930
welcomes people to the carnival but the

164
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,550
boys figure out that slowly but surely

165
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,770
it seems to be sucking away people's

166
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,460
souls

167
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,349
apparently draining their life force and

168
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,389
messing with their actual age of course

169
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,250
nobody believes the boys story so it's

170
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,289
up to them to figure out how to stop

171
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,569
this evil monster I get the feeling even

172
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,520
if I saw this as a little kid I wouldn't

173
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,219
find it very scary but it is pretty

174
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,380
creative the atmosphere on characters

175
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,150
especially make up for the fact that the

176
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,069
story itself is not phenomenally

177
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,190
interesting or

178
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,440
these kind of slow-moving they kind of

179
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,580
go through the typical run-of-the-mill

180
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,710
stuff of people not believing them

181
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,270
trying to convince those that will

182
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,240
believe them boiling the charismatic

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,200
diabolical Villa and all that good stuff

184
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,290
it's not a film that screams exciting or

185
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,660
super creepy it's more of a laid-back

186
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,600
kind of elegant film it's hard to

187
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,340
explain it's like the creepy stuff

188
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,500
doesn't come out at you and say boo

189
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,210
it's more building up this environment

190
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,760
that slowly is trying to get you without

191
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,040
you necessarily even knowing it and that

192
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,780
the foreground of that is Jonathan Pryce

193
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,060
who is just perfect as the villain he

194
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,610
never goes quite to over-the-top but at

195
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,890
the same time he's just so graceful and

196
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,470
loving of what he does just look at that

197
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,750
outfit you can tell he wears that suit

198
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,940
with such incredible charisma but at the

199
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,680
same time he's never too charming that

200
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,170
he's not scary a key can still look at

201
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,390
him and know he's the bad guy I really

202
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,130
like wills father in this too you just

203
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,050
get the feeling he's trying to make ends

204
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,060
meet be a good person and just do what

205
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,890
needs to be done but at the same time

206
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,660
life is trying to wear on him and he

207
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,980
just doesn't know what to believe in

208
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,720
anymore this of course is a great

209
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,520
contrast for the kids who see all sorts

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,740
of fantastic things but have a hard time

211
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,570
making the adult of the world realise it

212
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,030
a part of me does wish it would go a

213
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,400
little further with its creepy imagery

214
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,890
and disturbing thoughts why not get a

215
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,080
few more monsters or go a little bit

216
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,970
edgier I think that's why people still

217
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,530
talk about films like return to Oz and

218
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,110
Sleepy Hollow and so forth because they

219
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,820
did take risks and while this one

220
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,800
certainly has a lot of atmosphere it

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,020
doesn't really try anything that

222
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,570
different okay I don't be Monster Squad

223
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,480
style violence but something to make it

224
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,640
stand out a little bit more but then

225
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,470
again maybe you could argue that's a

226
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,030
part of its charm it's not an

227
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,830
in-your-face movie it's not a very

228
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,230
obvious monster film the journey and the

229
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,150
build-up and the suspense maybe is what

230
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,520
the star is supposed to be it is a kid's

231
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,350
film after all and after hearing all the

232
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,180
people that talk about and remember it I

233
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,040
guess it did leave a bigger impact than

234
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,320
I imagined it probably would it's a good

235
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,330
film I just don't think it's great I

236
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,130
think I get more sucked into the foggy

237
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,410
shadows that I do the actual characters

238
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,360
or story but they still suck me in

239
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,440
enough to want to know what's gonna

240
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,160
happen

241
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,570
if you're looking for one of those

242
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,360
classic intense 80s kids films are super

243
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,430
dark and super shocking that's probably

244
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,110
isn't it for you well if you're looking

245
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,789
for something to just put on that has a

246
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,070
lot of atmosphere and a bit of a creepy

247
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,810
vibe this might be more up your alley

248
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,700
think something like are you afraid of

249
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,010
the dark except a little smarter and

250
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,170
more elegant check it out next Halloween

251
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:13,970
and see for yourself growing up in the

252
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,610
80s and 90s we had a lot of various

253
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,260
specials that always acted like they

254
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,520
were gonna scare us

255
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,260
Weah Tales from the Crypt are you afraid

256
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,240
of the dark goosebumps all sorts of

257
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,980
various shows that kept explaining how

258
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,510
they were gonna scare the crap out of us

259
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,280
and don't get me wrong I like these

260
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,870
shows I think they're really creative

261
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,730
but there's always one problem to me

262
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,220
they were never scary evil mouths a kid

263
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,810
I was saying to myself where's the scary

264
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,010
stuff where's the stuff that's gonna

265
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,570
fuel my nightmares where's the stuff

266
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,550
that's gonna keep me up watch her in the

267
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,030
woods

268
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,520
is that movie yes it's Disney and yes

269
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,380
it's technically family-friendly but it

270
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,230
works like any great scary horror film a

271
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,020
lot of atmosphere a lot of buildup a lot

272
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,450
of mystery a lot of great shots and a

273
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,430
lot of creepy as well as clever imagery

274
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,350
the story is a family is looking in

275
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,790
Britain for a new house to move into

276
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,940
they of course find a big creepy place

277
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,560
that of course has this terrible

278
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,200
backstory an uncomfortable landlord and

279
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,430
all sorts of supernatural things

280
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,410
happening around it both the daughters

281
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,150
in the family seem to have strange

282
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,100
things happening to them the youngest is

283
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,900
almost being taken over like a puppet

284
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,610
and the older has a tendency to feel the

285
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,350
presence of people that were once there

286
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,300
before or just feel all sorts of

287
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,070
uncomfortable things slowly but surely

288
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,990
the truth about the disappearance of a

289
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,670
certain girl named Karen comes to light

290
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,110
and the daughters are trying to figure

291
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,640
out if it's the ghost of Karen that's

292
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,110
trying to get in contact with them or

293
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,420
something else what I like about this

294
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,400
film is that there's very few things

295
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,650
that actually separate it from a kid

296
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,870
scary film and a regular scary film in

297
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,550
fact I think this film has a lot more

298
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,380
atmosphere and scares than most scary

299
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,089
films

300
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,619
the only difference is there's no gore

301
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:46,989
murdering or swear words in it as well

302
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,059
as the pacing is a little quicker than

303
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,309
that of a usual scary movie but again

304
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,079
they want to keep the kids attention but

305
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,819
apart from that they treated pretty

306
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:57,459
adult notice how many quiet moments are

307
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,259
in this yeah remember that you could

308
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,479
have family films that had quiet moments

309
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,829
there didn't always need to be a ton of

310
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,809
music or talking this is called

311
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,059
establishing mood and it's dunked right

312
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,219
here the shots are also great I

313
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:10,629
absolutely love how they make these

314
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,879
woods both beautiful and creepy at the

315
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,649
same time the cinematography

316
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,959
surprisingly kind of has an evil dead

317
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,209
feel to it obviously not as over-the-top

318
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,119
but just as clever with its setups my

319
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,859
favorite shot is right in the opening

320
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,779
it's just a car pulling into the place

321
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,859
well that's no biggie no well that shot

322
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,679
was kind of sloppily done wait a minute

323
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,869
why are we still rolling oh my god this

324
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,189
is a point of view shot

325
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,839
what's watching them what's going on

326
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,969
okay it's not a big scare but at the

327
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,919
same time it kind of catches you off

328
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,929
your guard it's setting up something you

329
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,519
didn't know what's being set up and

330
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,469
that's what a good scary film should do

331
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:49,569
the fine thing too is that there's a lot

332
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:51,309
of point view shots in this film but

333
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,599
just when you're about to get sick of

334
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,519
them they do something new with it for

335
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,409
example here's a shot of her just going

336
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,879
through the woods yeah yeah something's

337
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,899
watching her we've seen that a million

338
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,639
times but then at some point she goes

339
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,919
inside and wait a minute it's still out

340
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,599
there why would they show this shot if

341
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,829
something wasn't gonna happen

342
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:07,839
and it does and it was properly built up

343
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,849
and properly delivered and just we think

344
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:10,959
a shot like that can't make you

345
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,579
uncomfortable again there's another

346
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,109
scene where she's being followed well

347
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,519
okay again we've seen that a million

348
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,739
times but wait a minute now it's inside

349
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,509
we didn't know it could go inside every

350
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,619
time we've seen it it's always been

351
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,689
outside every time they do something

352
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,219
with a point of view shot they add

353
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,289
something new to put you in a new state

354
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,179
of uncomfortableness it doesn't downplay

355
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,769
anything because it's also gonna be

356
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,959
shown to kids no it wants to scare the

357
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,299
kids because that's why you're seeing a

358
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,729
scary movie I always hate it when those

359
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,439
other shows had to clean it up and not

360
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,629
make it too creepy this goes all out

361
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,129
there and tries to scare you without

362
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,959
actually psychologically harming you

363
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,749
kids can be drawn in to smart things and

364
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:49,659
scary films can be smart the only

365
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,639
downside I have of this film is that the

366
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,600
acting from the main character is not

367
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,089
very good it's really hokey and awkward

368
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,829
and kind of reminds me of the girlfriend

369
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,290
from airplane but I did see something in

370
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,690
the mist at the pond that's why I fell

371
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,120
in but even then I don't mind too much

372
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
because the whole film has such a

373
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,500
strange feel to it that even the acting

374
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
in its weirdness actually kind of blends

375
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,850
in the whole film style is so uniquely

376
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,740
its own that you kind of get used to it

377
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,750
and maybe a cat's to the weird feeling

378
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,160
that you have throughout the entire

379
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,759
movie

380
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,740
I don't want give away too much as part

381
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,089
of the fund is being scared and

382
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,550
surprised by it but I will say it's very

383
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,529
well done I kind of don't know why more

384
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,300
people aren't talking about it I mean

385
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,850
it's a legit scary film from Disney how

386
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,259
often does that happen

387
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,120
I mean we got scary moments from other

388
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,889
films that scare us because we're kids

389
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,959
and yeah some of them go really far but

390
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,000
this is actually intending throughout

391
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,800
the majority of the film to scare you

392
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,110
and it's actually effective our scary

393
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,940
movie fans just put off that the Disney

394
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,800
logo is in front of it our Disney fans

395
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,509
put off that's a little too dark and not

396
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:52,880
as obvious for kids I don't know but it

397
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,500
definitely deserves a lot more attention

398
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,420
okay I don't think it's gonna send

399
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,339
anyone out running and screaming but at

400
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,589
the same time it just creates this mood

401
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,779
in this environment that just feels

402
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,139
drange and dark and creepy and Pownall

403
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,089
personally I just love it I wish more

404
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,980
scary films aimed at kids tried this

405
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,889
hard Alano if it's a censorship issue or

406
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,540
if people are just too afraid to push

407
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,519
the limit but there's got to be more

408
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,380
movies like this I can tell you for

409
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,790
certain I found a new film to watch

410
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,709
every Halloween the atmosphere the

411
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,259
environment the story the characters the

412
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,329
scares I'm just in love with this film

413
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:27,949
it's definitely worth checking out with

414
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,569
the lights off when you're all alone and

415
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:41,810
you feel like somebody's watching you

416
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:54,680
I have never seen a film that looks like

417
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,690
Dick Tracy and I know a lot of people

418
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,220
say that although this imagery isn't

419
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,480
like anything you've ever seen in blah

420
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,820
blah blah but it's really true I can't

421
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,920
think of any other movie that looks like

422
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,870
this this might be the most ambitious

423
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,100
Lee visual spectacle I've seen in years

424
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,640
it's crazy the colors that designs the

425
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,810
costumes the makeup it's totally insane

426
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,760
which is why it really sucks that I

427
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,580
can't remember a single friggin thing

428
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,890
about it is it that the visuals were so

429
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,660
good it distracted from the rest of the

430
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,089
story or is it that the story wasn't

431
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,370
really that hot to begin with Dick Tracy

432
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,230
based on the famous newspaper comic

433
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,000
strip is the yellow trench coat wearing

434
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,070
cop played by Warren Beatty who's trying

435
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,050
to take down the massive crime in his

436
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,390
fair city his arch-nemesis big boy

437
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,700
played by Al Pacino is the yelling and

438
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,500
screaming mob gangster who constantly

439
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,630
wants to put him out of his way he comes

440
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,600
across a kid simply named kid a singer

441
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,190
named breathless Mahoney played by

442
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,350
Madonna and all sorts of weird and

443
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,300
literally colorful characters that

444
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,040
constantly want to kill it there's

445
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,980
flat-top babyface the blank they only

446
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,290
get crazier and crazier okay so the

447
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,870
basic story is good guys versus bad guy

448
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,240
has cute kid sidekick has a femme fatale

449
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,970
all the classic stuff you usually see in

450
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,280
a lot of film noir is and so on that

451
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,380
part is easy to follow what's not easy

452
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,150
to follow it's the steps they're taking

453
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,910
to create this formula there's a lot of

454
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,980
talk of business a lot of talk of fraud

455
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,290
a lot of talk a strategy a lot of talk

456
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,690
of planning a lot of talk of breaking in

457
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,209
busting a person and yeah we see it

458
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,880
happen but what do we really know about

459
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,350
these people

460
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,209
aside from Al Pacino who's really

461
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,310
yucking it up as the bad guy

462
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,839
there's nothing memorable about these

463
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,360
characters Warren Beatty is a tough cop

464
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,980
and that's about it

465
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,170
Madonna is the hot singer and that's

466
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,300
about it the wisecracking kids a

467
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,520
wisecracking kid and that's about it you

468
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,839
get where I'm going with this

469
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,180
hearing them talk is not very riveting

470
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,970
and it's

471
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,889
we being distracted by how incredible

472
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,869
the backgrounds are when the action

473
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:59,939
finally does start it looks pretty cool

474
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,739
but what do I care if any of these

475
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,959
people get axed off a part of me kind of

476
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,459
respects that they're trying to take

477
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,860
such a cartoon Elise illy looking film

478
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,679
so seriously but on the other hand I

479
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,759
just wish it could have been more

480
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,129
interesting I remember in the credits

481
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,779
that said that Dick Van Dyke was in this

482
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,759
movie Dick Van Dyke where the hell was

483
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,829
he oh there he is

484
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,409
god I didn't even notice him he's in and

485
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,909
out of the film so fast that he's barely

486
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,100
even worth the credit if Dick Van Dyke

487
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,860
dick then frickin die can't leave an

488
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,110
impact on you in a movie you know

489
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,669
there's got to be something wrong with

490
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:33,029
it

491
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,830
on top of that there's a lot of scenes

492
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,019
in the movie they're just downright

493
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,610
gruesome especially for a Disney film

494
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,440
early on they take this one gangster

495
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,299
down by tying him up putting him in a

496
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,460
box covering him in when cement and then

497
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,889
throwing him in the river all while he's

498
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,200
crying and sobbing the whole time that's

499
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,330
pretty intense don't get me

500
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,100
wrong I like a little dark and gritty in

501
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,659
Disney films but it's like something

502
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,669
right out of a nightmare I guess to the

503
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,830
film's credit it's not that it's really

504
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,460
bad or annoying it's just kind of dull

505
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,250
like I said I can barely remember what

506
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,350
actually happened in this movie I just

507
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,450
remember it looked beautiful while it

508
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,539
was happening with that said yeah it is

509
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,730
friggin unbelievable to look at I mean

510
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,409
who would dressed this way who would

511
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,179
design their buildings this way who

512
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,860
would choose these colors who would have

513
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,039
faces this bizarrely weird nobody would

514
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,019
its obviously taking the idea of

515
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,850
adapting the comic strip which was very

516
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,529
bright colorful and over-the-top to a

517
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:31,320
whole new level it's definitely in its

518
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,000
own unique world one where the

519
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,980
backgrounds don't even have to look that

520
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,840
convincing I mean look at this this is

521
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,700
so obviously a matte painting they're

522
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,470
not even trying to hide the brushstrokes

523
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,570
but that's just part of the style

524
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,940
it all looks phony but in the same way

525
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,070
that a puppeteer holding a puppet you

526
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,169
know is phony but you don't care it's

527
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,210
just so well done that you enjoy every

528
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,159
second of it so I'm kind of torn on the

529
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,559
movie on the one hand I'm glad I saw it

530
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,929
if for any other reason just to see it

531
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,370
but on the other hand

532
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,320
yeah why couldn't they make the story

533
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,210
more interesting like lonely flesh out

534
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,830
the characters more why couldn't they be

535
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,380
a lot more fun like I said Pacino's

536
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,360
great but everyone else is just so

537
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,940
phoned in and standard just because they

538
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,650
looked as dink doesn't mean they act

539
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,520
distinct

540
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,770
I remember the makeup in the layout much

541
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,600
more they remember anything else in this

542
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,730
bill that's really a shame if this

543
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,110
didn't have a memorable story and

544
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,090
characters maybe it could be like one of

545
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,340
the great film memoirs a film that plays

546
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,170
to incredibly heavy shadows but also

547
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,170
somehow incredibly heavy colors it could

548
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,610
have been sort of this one-of-a-kind

549
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,790
masterpiece but as is is really just a

550
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,220
style over substance movie if you want

551
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,750
to see the style and you just enjoy

552
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,730
watching people and trench coats and

553
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,770
fedora hats punch each other and shoot

554
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,170
then you'll at least be glad that you

555
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,970
saw it but if none of that does it for

556
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,500
you it then I'm sad to say this is a

557
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,420
very unfortunate skip

558
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:58,080
[Music]

559
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:05,540
[Music]

560
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,460
[Music]

561
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,320
it's the holiday classic The Nightmare

562
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,989
Before Christmas boy talk about a film

563
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:14,879
that only did okay at the box office but

564
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,330
just exploded in cult merchandise every

565
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,039
year around Halloween you see this stuff

566
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,840
advertised and now every year around

567
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,549
Christmas you see it advertised as well

568
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,859
somewhere the appreciation of this film

569
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,840
just went through the roof and now

570
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,090
everybody loves to draw the characters

571
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,009
they love to sing the songs it's so

572
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:35,039
iconic but once again I almost feel like

573
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,109
that can backfire and build it up too

574
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,730
much for audiences that might be

575
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,799
expecting something else in a sense

576
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,210
that's kind of what I went through when

577
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,190
I first saw it and I saw when it first

578
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,859
came out he was advertised on TV Tim

579
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,230
Burton's name was plastered all over it

580
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,519
and it came out around the same time

581
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,799
that movies like Aladdin Lion King and

582
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,690
so many other anime groundbreakers came

583
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,059
out so with that said I thought there

584
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,249
would probably be a few more adult jokes

585
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,259
thrown in there you know like what they

586
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,840
do with rabble Liam's improvising and so

587
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,149
on but that's not the kind of movie it

588
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:08,429
is it's more a warped version of those

589
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,289
stop-motion Christmas specials that you

590
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:12,359
see every year except dragged out to an

591
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,220
hour and a half it seems all the

592
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,409
holidays are given their own land

593
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,570
Halloween town Christmas town and all

594
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,159
that kind of stuff the leader of

595
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,619
Halloween Jack Skellington is funnily

596
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,299
getting tired of his holiday a lots to

597
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,350
try something new

598
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,480
thus he accidentally stumbles across the

599
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,039
Christmas holiday and decides he wants

600
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,840
to take it for his own showing the

601
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,340
people of Halloween what he's discovered

602
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,320
and even kidnapping Santa Claus himself

603
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,299
Jack decides he's gonna transform a

604
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,369
Merry Christmas into a scary Christmas

605
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:40,320
instead of bringing treats and toys he's

606
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,629
gonna bring creeps and scares ultimately

607
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,029
resulting in a disaster as catastrophe

608
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:47,669
the movie has a lot going for it first

609
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,009
of all the story is wonderful it's so

610
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,230
simple and setup and yet allows for so

611
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,080
much creativity it's bizarrely very easy

612
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,570
to explain and even easier to grasp the

613
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,830
visuals of course being a Tim Burton

614
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,749
production are gonna be wonderful and

615
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:02,549
not only that the music's gonna be

616
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,559
spectacular this is the first time in

617
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,059
years Danny Elfman has been allowed to

618
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,879
write songs again and

619
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:10,159
man do they knock it out of the park you

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,169
know these songs this is Halloween

621
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,779
what's this what's this making Christmas

622
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:15,919
the list goes on

623
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,929
Elfman himself does the singing voice of

624
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,299
Jack and he adds so much character to it

625
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,459
this whole film is practically his movie

626
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:24,829
but what people might be turned off by

627
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,449
especially those who have had at hype

628
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:29,509
dub is that it is maybe a little too

629
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:32,029
simple at least for what people might be

630
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:34,129
expecting the movie doesn't have a lot

631
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,499
of inside jokes are super clever writing

632
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:39,289
it's sort of very bare bone because of

633
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,389
this it doesn't allow for a ton of

634
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:44,419
character or a ton of surprises but

635
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:46,519
that's not really the focus it's

636
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,899
supposed to operate more like a very

637
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,329
basic fairy tale like a book you'd read

638
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,879
to your little kid in fact help it was

639
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:55,639
originally a book and in rhyme to some

640
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,529
might have a problem with this but it's

641
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:58,519
understandable

642
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,169
they could have updated it a little bit

643
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:01,789
more they could have made the characters

644
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,039
a bit more interesting but for a lot of

645
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,109
people the simplicity is what draws them

646
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,449
to it it's a timeless story that can be

647
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:10,969
told to anyone and anyone can grasp it

648
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,159
very quickly it's similar to something

649
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,259
like the boy who cried wolf you don't

650
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,179
need to know the boy's backstory you

651
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,069
don't need to know his character you

652
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:21,049
just need to know the very simple layout

653
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:23,329
now is that good for an hour and a half

654
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:26,389
movie somewhat debate no me personally I

655
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,099
think there's enough creativity with the

656
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,859
songs the atmospheres the designs and

657
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,529
even the very basic characteristics that

658
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,989
I think it works ok I'd be lying if I

659
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:37,609
said this was one of my absolute

660
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,949
favorites in Burton films I mean it's

661
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:41,839
good and I really like it and I can hear

662
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,909
those songs over and over but it's not

663
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,949
something I really watch because the

664
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,259
characters are so deep or the emotions

665
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,969
are so rich i watch something like

666
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:51,589
Batman or Edward Scissorhands for that

667
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,629
Nightmare Before Christmas is just a

668
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:56,209
very simple yet still very clever and

669
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:59,119
creative kids story and like I said the

670
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,159
simplicity is what helps it sell and

671
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,199
what helps it stay around for so long I

672
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,579
think that's one of the reasons it

673
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,440
wasn't a monster hit when it came out

674
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,319
but people still seem to talk about it

675
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,569
and buy merchandise from it all the time

676
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:13,609
they appreciate the basicness of it in

677
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:14,809
the same way they appreciate the

678
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,909
basicness of Santa Claus and can

679
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,799
immediately connect it to the holiday or

680
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,450
in this case two holidays

681
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,670
I say I appreciate it more than I like

682
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,860
it but I do still enjoy putting it on

683
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,050
every once in a while the songs the

684
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,240
imagery the creativity than just a

685
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,550
little too strong for me to resist it's

686
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,380
a simple film that knew just how much to

687
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,120
deliver and how much to let you take

688
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,860
away from it and it doesn't look like

689
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:59,510
it'll be leaving anytime soon a lot of

690
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,680
times when people try to take a

691
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,570
successful TV show and make a movie out

692
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,310
of it the number one complaint is that

693
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,650
it just seems like a longer version of

694
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,170
an episode but with duck tales it kind

695
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,540
of makes sense because every episode was

696
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,000
kind of like a mini movie so why not

697
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,890
make an actual movie out of it in this

698
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,810
case it definitely pays off and it's

699
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,070
kind of a shame it doesn't get more

700
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,230
attention than it deserves it's funny

701
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,850
because this came out near the same time

702
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,380
as the rescuers down under another

703
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,030
adventurous Disney film that doesn't get

704
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,800
enough attention it has all the great

705
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,930
animation the characters you remember a

706
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,880
lot of great action a few good jokes

707
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,610
it's an enjoyable family film scrooge

708
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,410
mcduck and the gang are on the search

709
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,510
for the treasure of collie Baba get it

710
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,580
but their tour guide named is Jean is

711
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,830
working for an evil sorcerer named

712
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:49,400
Merlin played by Christopher Lloyd he

713
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,900
knows that the real treasure of collie

714
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,510
Baba lies in this magic lamp and that

715
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,100
with his magic talisman that can turn

716
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,050
him into any animal can combine it with

717
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,330
the lamp to get unlimited wishes the

718
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,130
lay-up however falls out of his hands

719
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,080
and instead into the hands of Huey Dewey

720
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,270
Louie and webby who discovered the crazy

721
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,310
genie inside played by Rick Taylor

722
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,110
he's Amy and goofy of course and

723
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,940
befriends the kids very quickly once

724
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,620
Scrooge discovers say he uses it of

725
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,510
course for greedy means and while being

726
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,370
chased down by the evil sorcerer he

727
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,500
discovers what truly matters and blah

728
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,050
blah blah action learning a lesson all

729
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,730
that good stuff okay so there's no

730
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,560
groundbreaking morals there to be

731
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,150
learned here but that's not what duck

732
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,130
tales was all about in fact duck tales

733
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,870
wasn't even as much about action as it

734
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,060
was adventure and this is a really

735
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,070
enjoyable adventure

736
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,720
I feel like all the characters we've

737
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,250
grown to love get the proper amount of

738
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,389
screen time that they deserve

739
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,490
Christopher Lloyd is menacing of course

740
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,440
as the villain and the tailor is an

741
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,630
adequate genie I do feel bad because

742
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,789
shortly after a much funnier Disney

743
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,620
genie would pop about that nobody could

744
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,120
really compete with but for something

745
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,370
that's more focused on kids and family

746
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,440
and not really adult jokes I think he

747
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,779
works okay it's fine cuz the animator on

748
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,610
the show was already pretty impressive

749
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,470
so they had to up it even more from the

750
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,990
movie and it really looks good the only

751
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,299
thing that might raise a few eyebrows is

752
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,730
the character of Dijon I don't know is

753
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:15,730
this an offensive character now back

754
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,440
then nobody thought twice about but

755
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,299
nowadays with people's sensitivities I'm

756
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,370
not sure this could be taken the wrong

757
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,620
way or not I mean he does have a thick

758
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,409
accent and he is a thief I personally

759
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,639
never thought they were saying anything

760
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:29,440
about an entire race but maybe that's

761
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,240
why it never got such a major DVD

762
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,970
release oh no he's fine by me but some

763
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,679
people might take it a different way

764
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,110
like I said before it's just one big

765
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,480
duck tails episode but we all really

766
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,190
like the duck tails episodes and what

767
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,809
they had to give us and here it is on a

768
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,120
grand scale I'd be lying if I said it

769
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,100
was as good as the original few episodes

770
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,259
that were tied together in the beginning

771
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,149
but hey we're doing a movie now and you

772
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:53,799
gotta play by movie rules and for

773
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,570
Playboy movie rules I think this film

774
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,070
does really well and it's entertaining

775
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,409
and it's engaging does they have a ton

776
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:01,960
of adult stuff not especially I'd say

777
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,000
it's more family-oriented but there's

778
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,620
nothing wrong with that it's done well

779
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,600
it's done creatively and it's a whole

780
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,399
lot of fun so if you like the show

781
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:10,659
growing up or you're a big fan of

782
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,370
adventure this is definitely one to

783
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,380
check out

784
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,920
[Music]

785
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,150
[Applause]

786
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:27,210
[Music]

787
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,520
[Music]

788
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,750
well if you saw my original Disney

789
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,670
semper review of 101 Dalmatians you

790
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,559
probably won't be that shocked that I

791
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,030
think pretty much the same thing about

792
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,740
the live-action one which is fine

793
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,750
because in many respects it is exactly

794
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,070
like the original and yet completely

795
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,950
different the story is exactly the same

796
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,200
the characters are exactly the same the

797
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,390
setting is exactly the same but there is

798
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,820
however one major difference the dogs

799
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,580
don't talk a lot of people I remember

800
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,020
when this was coming out we're really

801
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,570
angry and shocked at that oh my god how

802
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,520
can the dogs not talk they talked in the

803
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,650
original holy smokes and what's it all

804
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,809
about - well very much like the anime

805
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,030
one is just a movie about watching

806
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,130
puppies and if you like to watch puppies

807
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,800
you'll like this film fine the story

808
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,630
centers around a male Dalmatian and his

809
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,700
owner played by Jeff Daniels who has his

810
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,710
eye on a female Dalmatian who has a

811
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,510
pretty attractive owner as well of

812
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,429
course both the dogs and the humans meet

813
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:22,710
up and they decide to get together over

814
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,360
time they get married and eventually the

815
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,670
female dog gets pregnant giving birth to

816
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,140
15 adorable puppies but an evil villain

817
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,970
incredible play by Glenn Close wants to

818
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,679
buy the puppies so she can turn them

819
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,840
into fur coats when the owners tell her

820
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,820
that they're not for sale she hires two

821
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,320
henchmen one of them played by Hugh

822
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,270
Laurie to kidnap the puppies and add

823
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,250
them to her collection that's right a

824
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,590
collection for she plans to make tons of

825
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,410
fur coat out of tons of puppies 99 to be

826
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,330
exact when the parents as well as other

827
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,670
animals catch word Thor races on to see

828
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,140
if they can save the puppies before

829
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,640
they're turned into fashion statements

830
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,890
on the one hand I say to myself this is

831
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,230
a completely pointless movie to exist

832
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,420
did this really demand to be brought to

833
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,910
the live-action cinema but with that

834
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,830
said if you had to bring it to

835
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,200
live-action cinema I actually think it's

836
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,870
pretty reasonably done I really applaud

837
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,730
the fact that they don't have them talk

838
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,920
not only was the technology not up to it

839
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,720
back then I mean they could move the

840
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,700
lifts but they look at it creepy but the

841
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,590
movie knows exactly what the people want

842
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,140
they just want to see cute dogs and if

843
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,790
they start talking it would just be

844
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,190
really weird and distracting thus we had

845
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,600
to rely on the charm of the human

846
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,340
characters which for the most part hold

847
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,890
up for

848
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,290
well I mean for such bit parts that have

849
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,090
little to on they actually got some

850
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,130
really good actors to bring into life

851
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,140
the romantic couple are good the

852
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,690
henchmen are good and yeah let's talk

853
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,090
about Glenn Close is corral Deville on

854
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,970
the one hand I should be really angry at

855
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,310
this performance because yeah Cruella

856
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,140
Deville is an over-the-top character but

857
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,960
this is really over the top

858
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,420
Carrillo was an angry bitter woman this

859
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,360
is just a laughing lunatic she's more

860
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,550
like a 60s Batman villain than she is a

861
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,620
Disney villain and God doesn't that

862
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,780
sound weird to say she's making animated

863
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,510
Disney villains look subtle however with

864
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,060
that said she just cracks me the up

865
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,730
it's kind of like a female Tim Curry or

866
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,950
Christopher Walken there's just no doubt

867
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,230
that she's doing whatever the hell she

868
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,390
wants I mean look at her she's totally

869
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,600
off her rocker if we make this code it

870
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,360
would be as if I were wearing your dog

871
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:35,280
[Laughter]

872
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,290
maybe the way to look at it is not that

873
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,300
she absolutely captured the original

874
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,400
animated character but she turned it

875
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,610
into something 100% different and just

876
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,190
ran all the way with it hell ran to the

877
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,810
 moon with it she's so

878
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:57,510
over-the-top like who's a puppy code

879
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,130
just can't stop laughing at her she's a

880
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,130
 rocket for what it is the film

881
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,940
is really not that bad it's 100%

882
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,440
serviceable I can't really see anyone

883
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,510
going into this movie being incredibly

884
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,430
disappointed I mean what do you think

885
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,780
you're going to see you're gonna see

886
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,370
Glenn Close over the top and you're

887
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,190
gonna see cute puppies that's it and as

888
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,440
that setup goes it's obvious they put a

889
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,450
lot of effort into it I think the only

890
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,980
people that would really want to see

891
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,810
them at are the same people that go see

892
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,180
Santa Paws but I give this movie credit

893
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,220
that it tries to be visually interesting

894
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,920
it tries to cast some good people it

895
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,510
tries to tell Allah the story through

896
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,580
silence which can be very difficult to

897
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,040
do so I guess I appreciate it more than

898
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,740
I actually like it I guess I like it a

899
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,120
little better than the anime version

900
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,610
it's just I didn't really even get into

901
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,770
the anime version that much I think it's

902
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,540
very simple if you really like dogs

903
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,700
especially Dalmatians you'll really like

904
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,000
this and yeah if you just want to see an

905
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,580
actress go batshit insane it's actually

906
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,590
kind of fun to watch for that - you're

907
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,120
looking for a fun little family film

908
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,530
with cute little animals that's not

909
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,610
gonna offend anybody

910
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,130
this definitely hits the spot

911
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:20,920
[Music]

912
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,080
[Music]

913
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,639
when Ricky Ralph first came out the term

914
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,230
those being thrown around a lot is that

915
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,299
it was the Roger Rabbit of video game

916
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,460
movies and from the advertising it kind

917
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,019
of looked like that you saw kind of a

918
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,450
Donkey Kong ish knockoff suddenly in

919
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,399
with all these really famous characters

920
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,409
there's Bowser there's a bunch of street

921
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,000
fighter guys there's the ghost from

922
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,370
pac-man nothing like this has ever been

923
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,559
done in a movie at least not with video

924
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,750
games it really was the equivalent of

925
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,159
seeing Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny

926
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:50,630
together it was so surreal

927
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,909
however when Roger Rabbit a lot of these

928
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:54,320
characters keep popping up throughout

929
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
the entire film in this one it's only

930
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,730
the first couple minutes because of this

931
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,260
there was definitely crowd of people

932
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,630
that kind of fell ripped off I mean the

933
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,669
commercials they showed every scene that

934
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,220
had a video game character in it so when

935
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,690
you actually watch the film there's

936
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,270
practically nothing left I kind of like

937
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,800
those people want a little bit more of

938
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,720
them but the good news is the story and

939
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,669
characters were so good that you almost

940
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:19,040
don't notice much like Roger Rabbit the

941
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,200
story can completely hold up on its own

942
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,970
even if you didn't have those characters

943
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,540
in there

944
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,490
the main leads and ideas are more than

945
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,679
enough to keep it afloat the film starts

946
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,240
off in an arcade where there's an old

947
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,460
80's game called fix-it Felix the

948
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,020
villain of the game is wreck-it Ralph

949
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,629
kind of a Donkey Kong style character

950
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:37,849
that doesn't get much respect little do

951
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,829
we know there's a whole video game world

952
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,359
going on right under our noses

953
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,669
characters use the plugs and wires to

954
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,980
all meet up in one location to shoot the

955
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,960
 talk nonsense all that good stuff

956
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,970
but Ralph's like a lot of video game

957
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,589
villains it's not feeling very loved

958
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,810
he's feeling underappreciated as the bad

959
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,190
guy of the game and what's more

960
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,629
attention for the important work that he

961
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,940
does so it starts game hopping to find

962
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,950
some way to get his reward the only

963
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,420
thing he can figure is that if he got a

964
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,579
medal somehow that would mean that he's

965
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,920
done a great deed so he travels into one

966
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,780
of the much more violent video games

967
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,880
gets his medal but loses it in another

968
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,650
one along the way he comes across a

969
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,750
glitch named Penelope who lives in kind

970
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,970
of a Mario Kart world where nobody likes

971
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,010
her either so they make a deal with one

972
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,570
another

973
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,310
if Ralph can help her get in the game

974
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,840
and get the appreciation she deserves

975
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,940
she'll help him get his medal back and

976
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,040
get him the appreciation he deserves but

977
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,900
there's an even bigger conspiracy going

978
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,330
on between villain side characters and

979
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,130
all sorts of craziness that might result

980
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,110
in the end of the video game world as we

981
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,060
know it I'm really impressed how even

982
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,800
though it's kind of a complicated story

983
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,480
when you get down to it they explain it

984
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,490
in a very simple way the film is very

985
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,170
good at throwing in different surprises

986
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,670
and turns around every corner in

987
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,770
explaining how the world works through

988
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,720
warp zones and cheat codes you can

989
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,100
actually change your identity and

990
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,200
anything about your environment really

991
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,300
the movie takes total advantage of

992
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,430
what's given to them it isn't just using

993
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,930
popular video game characters it's

994
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,180
totally embracing the idea of what they

995
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,250
have incorporating both the retro games

996
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,900
of the past and the newer games of today

997
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,000
throw the clever writing in satire

998
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,530
though there's also a very heartfelt

999
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,990
story between vanellope and ralph this

1000
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,970
is the focus of the film and yeah I'd

1001
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,230
like to seen a few more video game

1002
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,910
characters this really is where the

1003
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,220
attention should be the voice acting in

1004
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,830
this is beyond pitch perfect I mean talk

1005
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,350
about getting the best people to match

1006
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,750
these characters john c reilly is the

1007
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,240
big doofus who has a heart of gold Sarah

1008
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,490
Silverman's the smart aleck little brat

1009
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,530
Jane Lynch is the badass commander with

1010
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,050
a backstory so funny I dare not ruin it

1011
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,360
here the list goes on this is one of

1012
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,950
those movies that does so well and

1013
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,230
combining really great humor in with the

1014
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,300
story that's telling they almost go hand

1015
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,990
in hand

1016
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,610
like something that's a pretty funny Joe

1017
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,920
can also be a major plot device the

1018
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,900
explanation about why Penelope has to be

1019
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,640
kept out of the game is actually both

1020
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,290
really funny and really heartbreaking

1021
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,330
even though these are just video game

1022
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,590
characters and you play them all the

1023
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,480
time you really get wrapped up and what

1024
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,190
they're going through you want to see

1025
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,720
Ralph Guetta's metal you want to see

1026
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Penelope win the race you want to see

1027
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,870
all sorts of good things happen to them

1028
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,030
and overcome evil and all along the way

1029
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,440
you're getting these great in jokes that

1030
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,940
you don't need to know in order to

1031
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,470
follow it but it just makes it all the

1032
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,600
more enjoyable if you do I say my only

1033
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,190
hang-up with the film is that we get a

1034
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,070
little bit of that for scene where the

1035
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,830
good guy has to be bad in order to not

1036
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,710
hurt the other good guy and it's okay

1037
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,810
not a misunderstanding or liar reveal

1038
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,330
story but you know the drill just when

1039
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,160
they're becoming the best of friends one

1040
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,260
of them has to do something really mean

1041
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,829
to hurt

1042
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,599
the other one but it's also in order to

1043
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,239
save them and honestly if it hadn't been

1044
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,430
done a million times before it probably

1045
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,259
would have worked fine here I mean they

1046
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,209
do explain everything pretty well but

1047
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,519
you just know after their little fight

1048
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,709
and moping and doping around one of them

1049
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,469
has to come to a realization and go back

1050
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,450
and say they're sorry and that we can

1051
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,880
begin the climax I know we need conflict

1052
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,619
I know we need drama but we also need a

1053
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,660
little variety and this has been done a

1054
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,959
lot of times before the climax itself is

1055
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,190
also a little mundane

1056
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,229
I mean at first it's great starting off

1057
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,150
with this race and people jumping on top

1058
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,039
of other cars and stuff but then you go

1059
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,599
into this fight on top of a mountain

1060
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,339
with one of the characters turning into

1061
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:15,249
a big monster and it's not awful it's

1062
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:16,869
just again we've seen this a million

1063
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,969
times and there isn't anything bad do to

1064
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:21,190
it but honestly those are small gripes

1065
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,200
Ricky Ralph has really likeable

1066
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,749
characters a very clever setup and a

1067
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:27,369
story environment that makes you realize

1068
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,259
you don't need as much of the gimmicks

1069
00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:31,089
as you thought you would yeah it's neat

1070
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:32,979
to see Zangief yeah it's neat that they

1071
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,809
reference where a Croft but that's not

1072
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:36,819
what the movies about nor should it be

1073
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,890
what it's about it's about a connection

1074
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,539
between these two polar opposites who

1075
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,549
also have them to be Outsiders and so

1076
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:44,199
they find a way to band together

1077
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,940
oh well throwing in some really funny

1078
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,469
side characters and some really great

1079
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:49,420
humor you may not get as many classic

1080
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,890
characters as you want but you'll

1081
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,089
definitely get a whole bunch of new ones

1082
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:56,570
better just as good

1083
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:07,020
[Music]

1084
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,250
[Music]

1085
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,140
you know it's funny when I saw Monsters

1086
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,549
Inc the first thing I thought to myself

1087
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,950
was yeah that was okay but I wonder what

1088
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,539
they could do with the sequel I'm

1089
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:18,770
assuming if you're watching this you

1090
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,720
know how that first film ends so with

1091
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,609
that ending you do kind of see a little

1092
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:23,720
bit of possibility

1093
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,359
what if boo did grow up what a sullivan

1094
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:27,500
kept watching her

1095
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,210
what did she became an adult who could

1096
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,770
actually communicate with monsters or

1097
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,030
maybe when she got to an age she didn't

1098
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,260
believe in monsters anymore

1099
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,819
maybe monsters would disappear maybe

1100
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,140
it's something about losing childhood oh

1101
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,960
my god this practically writes itself

1102
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,030
but instead Pixar said it let's

1103
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,650
just do a tease College movies

1104
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:46,130
yeah because those to go so hand in hand

1105
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,260
rather than being a sequel we have a

1106
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,539
prequel showing how Mikan Solomon met up

1107
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,130
for the first time and of course didn't

1108
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,930
get along each one thinks they're gonna

1109
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,339
be the great student at muster

1110
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:57,349
University so naturally all sorts of

1111
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:59,359
competition and comedic antics take

1112
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,059
place but this menacing Dean decides she

1113
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:04,940
doesn't like them yeah I don't entirely

1114
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,430
know why she just kind of decides she

1115
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,529
doesn't like them maybe because that's

1116
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:11,480
what they do in a tease College movies I

1117
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,130
don't know and speaking of which if

1118
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,109
you've seen any 80s college movies I

1119
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:17,720
need any friggin 80s College movies

1120
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,119
you've seen monsters you it's not a

1121
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,279
satire of 80s college films that would

1122
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:23,779
be funny it's not doing anything

1123
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:25,579
different with eighties college films

1124
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,619
again that would be funny all it's doing

1125
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,480
is taking the exact same characters

1126
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,740
you've seen a million times and

1127
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,109
replacing them with monsters the bully

1128
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:35,930
jock the nerdy worm the stick-in-the-mud

1129
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,660
Dean the quirky dorks the need to make

1130
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,640
their frat house the greatest frat house

1131
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,710
that there is and of course all these

1132
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,450
people who don't get along trying to

1133
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,190
find a way to get along in the end I

1134
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,140
remember I saw the trailer for this I

1135
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,789
thought it looked really stupid but I

1136
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,890
also remember thing to myself its Pixar

1137
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,140
Pixar the originators of these

1138
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,049
incredible stories Finding Nemo of The

1139
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,680
Incredibles the freakin Toy Story films

1140
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,640
surely they wouldn't do something as

1141
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,279
phoned-in as this but then I remembered

1142
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,890
Cars 2 and got really depressed outside

1143
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,869
of a few designs of some of the monsters

1144
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,450
it's amazing the lack of originality

1145
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,650
this film has

1146
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,170
everything exists just to follow the

1147
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,960
80's college movies tropes I remember

1148
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,490
before seeing Muppets Most Wired they

1149
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,500
had a short based on monsters view and

1150
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,180
you know what it was a million times

1151
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,430
more interesting they took advantage of

1152
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,230
their environment and did something new

1153
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,180
with it though he promised that was just

1154
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,800
a few minutes long but this is an hour

1155
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,470
and a friggin half it's easily one of

1156
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,420
the most boring Pixar films I've ever

1157
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,730
sat through you can predict every joke

1158
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,200
you can predict every moment that's

1159
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,530
gonna happen it's just it's why was this

1160
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,750
deserving of so much time and effort to

1161
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,480
go into it the only new thing that pops

1162
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,520
up in this film is the ending and

1163
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,320
without giving away too much it is

1164
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,240
probably the only really good thing in

1165
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,130
it it's kind of the idea that you don't

1166
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,960
need to follow the traditional path that

1167
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,030
everybody else does but it's done in a

1168
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,980
way that's actually kind of clever and

1169
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,870
probably hits close to home for a lot of

1170
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,940
people in fact if I had to guess I would

1171
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,100
assume this whole film was made just so

1172
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,260
it could get this message across it's a

1173
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,300
message you don't see much in movies and

1174
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,850
especially in animated family films well

1175
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,500
then I guess we have the Pixar

1176
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,720
equivalent of Meet the Robinsons

1177
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,890
something that has a really good message

1178
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,020
but not the best means of displaying it

1179
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,510
but he'll even Meet the Robinsons was so

1180
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,280
strange and bizarre you could kind of

1181
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
admire it for how odd it is this is more

1182
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,330
like a textbook about how they made

1183
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,610
animal house hell even watching a movie

1184
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,110
about the making of animal house would

1185
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,580
be more interesting than watching this

1186
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,980
I've had a lot of fans upset with me

1187
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,600
that I didn't like this film but I'm

1188
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,020
sorry I just think it's awful I tried to

1189
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,760
go in with a clear mind I tried to open

1190
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,560
up to the idea that this could somehow

1191
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,470
work but it just sucks out all the funny

1192
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,720
all the originality all the interesting

1193
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,300
characters all the neat story ideas for

1194
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,210
such a stale experience I guess there's

1195
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,010
nothing bad in it in terms of stuff that

1196
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,290
be like offensive or unwatchable for

1197
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,120
your kids but for anyone who's an adult

1198
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,130
and has seen a tease College movies to

1199
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,810
death and wants to move on to something

1200
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,150
else this is a definite film to scare

1201
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,540
you away

1202
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:24,800
I can't describe the hate for the lone

1203
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,840
ranger that surrounded it when it first

1204
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,680
came out

1205
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,540
even from the previews people were just

1206
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,400
kind of rolling their eyes saying really

1207
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,920
really I'm not gonna lie I kind of had

1208
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,360
that reaction looking at the trailers

1209
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,430
too but when the critics got hold of it

1210
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,500
and the few people that actually want to

1211
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,280
see it by God they just despised it they

1212
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,350
said was overly long terribly written

1213
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,170
horribly acted and just made no sense at

1214
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,480
the time so I guess a large part of me

1215
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,100
was really dreading having to review

1216
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,870
this film but so many people have been

1217
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,310
talking about it I guess it kind of made

1218
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,530
sense to do so having finally seen it

1219
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,430
are they right

1220
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,000
well yeah but I don't know if I hate it

1221
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,340
as much as everybody else does it is

1222
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,010
definitely a bad movie and it is way too

1223
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,800
long but a part of me does kind of say

1224
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,740
if this came out 10 years ago say before

1225
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,720
the Pirates of the Caribbean movies I

1226
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,400
kind of wonder if it would have gotten a

1227
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,470
warmer reception it might have been that

1228
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,110
really bizarre distinct Western that's

1229
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,700
never really been done in this way

1230
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,980
before but because it did come out after

1231
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,750
pipes of the Caribbean has even done by

1232
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,310
the same people everyone just sort of

1233
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,350
saw it as fone did pirates except in the

1234
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,100
Old West

1235
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,470
and yeah they're pretty much right I

1236
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,000
guess a part of me does see a little bit

1237
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,620
of possibility with Pirates in the Old

1238
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,920
West though not much but a little the

1239
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,480
story opens with Johnny Depp as the

1240
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,880
famous Indian named Tonto he has a job

1241
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,540
just standing around in a museum I don't

1242
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,020
get it

1243
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,180
but the makeups neat and he comes across

1244
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,160
a boy who's interested in the story of

1245
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,440
The Lone Ranger well since he was there

1246
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,570
he tells the boy to sit back for two and

1247
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,610
a half hours and listen to his origin

1248
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,650
story The Lone Ranger was originally a

1249
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,720
lawyer who had a very successful brother

1250
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,030
who was a lawman one day after chasing

1251
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,860
down an escaped convict both of them are

1252
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,750
gunned down and even his brother's heart

1253
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,950
is eaten by the villain isn't that long

1254
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,839
but Otto is fascinated when the

1255
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,119
spiritual Horace seems to pick on main

1256
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,040
character to be brought back to life

1257
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,690
Tonto doesn't believe them as he knows

1258
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,880
he's an inexperienced to action hero but

1259
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,680
the horse has made this choice so Tonto

1260
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,390
decides to take him up as his partner

1261
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,859
bring him back to the world of the

1262
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,750
living and follow him to get justice

1263
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,790
and/or revenge on the people who killed

1264
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,530
him and his brother along the way they

1265
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,760
come across all sorts of strange

1266
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,280
characters colorful baddies and comedy

1267
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,990
ranging from the goofy to the downright

1268
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,329
grotesque I get the feeling a lot of the

1269
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:41,640
worst parts were already kind of told to

1270
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,829
me like the guy eating the heart or

1271
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:45,570
Johnny Depp being in the museum for no

1272
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,130
reason and some of the really stupid

1273
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:47,760
jokes

1274
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,680
so I guess expecting that going in I

1275
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,300
paid a little bit more attention to the

1276
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,460
stuff I actually kind of enjoyed I mean

1277
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,500
okay it's over-the-top and silly but

1278
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,940
that's kind of what I expected were the

1279
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,349
Pirates of the Caribbean Western

1280
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:00,210
everyone said giant Depp was just doing

1281
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,859
Jack Sparrow as an Indian in this

1282
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,720
version and yeah I see where they're

1283
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,550
coming from but I don't know if I quite

1284
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,890
see it as bad bad I still think he's a

1285
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,780
good actor and yeah sort of the bug-eyed

1286
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,430
and close lip thing is getting a little

1287
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,349
old but he still kept my interest enough

1288
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,839
now of course why he was chosen to play

1289
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,369
a Native American when there's about a

1290
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:19,380
million other actors therefore qualified

1291
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,829
to do so I'm not sure well yeah I knew

1292
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:24,690
he's a star buddy all that stuff I know

1293
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,060
everyone says he's like 190th Native

1294
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,890
American but how about somebody who's

1295
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,140
like majority Native American when that

1296
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,819
make a little bit more sense I mean we

1297
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:33,869
eat does a good job being the

1298
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,760
fish-out-of-water in this new territory

1299
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,380
trying to follow the law while also

1300
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,599
breaking it and being fairly charismatic

1301
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,430
throughout most of it the villains are

1302
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,890
mostly abour once again tying into some

1303
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,720
sort of complicated plot about the

1304
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,599
railroad and land ownership and oh who

1305
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,579
cares we just want to see Cowboys be

1306
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,250
Cowboys what it does do that it's kind

1307
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,010
of neat in that it's really weird these

1308
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,380
are very bizarre towns with very bizarre

1309
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,390
people in them but a part of me kind of

1310
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,040
likes that because I don't see that much

1311
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,109
in westerns I was even kind of liking

1312
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:05,760
the way they visually told the story

1313
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,470
for example there's this woman with a

1314
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,329
wooden leg who also wants revenge on the

1315
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,099
same person even though her business

1316
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,990
seems booming she says that Hebrew in

1317
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:13,770
her career

1318
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,480
literally all they do is show a picture

1319
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,730
of her as a ballet dancer and you get it

1320
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,040
know tons of dialog no big explanation

1321
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,840
scenes it's just one picture and boom

1322
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,940
you understand I like a movie that can

1323
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,860
do that I only wish the rest of the

1324
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,750
movie was like that at some point I

1325
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,550
found myself getting really bored and I

1326
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,710
looked on the DVD how long it was and we

1327
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,930
were even at the halfway point yet good

1328
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,620
God

1329
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,510
why does Hollywood nowadays think that

1330
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,370
if something has to be really big and

1331
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,010
epic it has to be super long not every

1332
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,750
movie needs to be lower the Rings not

1333
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,670
every movie has to be lords of Arabia

1334
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,590
the same thing happened with the Pirates

1335
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,870
movie stop trying to be these gigantic

1336
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,090
epics just be what you're supposed to be

1337
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,820
be the friggin Lone Ranger cowboy

1338
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,500
shooting having fun

1339
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,510
let the epics be the epics and you be

1340
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,310
something that's enjoyably mindless and

1341
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,350
I know it's ironic me saying that seeing

1342
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,880
how I did an anniversary film that was

1343
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,100
three and a half hours long but that had

1344
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,350
a lot of characters and to be fair this

1345
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:11,080
is to two guys that were following for

1346
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,840
an unbelievable amount of time I don't

1347
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,280
care who you put in that role that's

1348
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,710
gonna get boring after a while so yeah

1349
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,200
is the movie good absolutely not is it

1350
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,690
terrible

1351
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,100
probably but a good chunk of that comes

1352
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,170
from the timing if this was released

1353
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,220
before the Pirates of the Caribbean

1354
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,900
films I think it would have had a little

1355
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,250
bit more of a chance and it would have

1356
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,290
been seen as original and unique and

1357
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,750
strange and dark and just a movie unlike

1358
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,310
any other movie still having the

1359
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,200
problems I said before with it being way

1360
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,030
too long and such but I don't think it

1361
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,440
would have gotten quite the extreme

1362
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,690
hatred that it's getting today I'm glad

1363
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,870
I saw parts of it I mean it was just so

1364
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,360
creatively bizarre but what does any of

1365
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,100
it have to do with the original idea of

1366
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,230
the Lone Ranger and the Cowboys and the

1367
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,670
Indians and just riding around and

1368
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,510
having fun

1369
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,180
not much this feels like Disney knew it

1370
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,530
hit something big with the Pirates

1371
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,790
franchise so they tried to have

1372
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,590
lightning strike twice hell you could

1373
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,480
argue even the Pyrus franchise it didn't

1374
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,670
strike twice the result is a little too

1375
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,260
much of what we've already seen before

1376
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,540
and even then not done that great I

1377
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,910
guess even ads worse this directors work

1378
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,010
is just so strange died always find

1379
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,740
something of bizarre value to it so I'm

1380
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,660
not quite as pissed off as everybody

1381
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,200
else was at it but yeah it's still bad

1382
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,850
not the worst in my opinion but sadly

1383
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,500
not worth checking out either

1384
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:43,440
I kind of rolled my eyes when I heard

1385
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,120
they were making a Maleficent movie I

1386
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,040
mean it just seems like a pointless

1387
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,000
thing to do

1388
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,280
Maleficent is a great villain one of the

1389
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,070
great villain she's so charismatic and

1390
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,380
evil and loves every minute of it at his

1391
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,260
elegant and clever and diabolical she's

1392
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,760
given just the right amount of screen

1393
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,220
time in the original seating so the idea

1394
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,020
of learning more about her past didn't

1395
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,330
seem too bright but at the same time I

1396
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,550
was open to it I guess when the film

1397
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,950
finally came out it became very obvious

1398
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,960
what they were trying to do it's the

1399
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,150
Wicked formula again trying to take a

1400
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,670
fairy tale we all thought we knew and

1401
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,500
tell it a different way where the bad

1402
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,660
guy doesn't look so bad what I figured

1403
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,280
that out which you can't very quickly in

1404
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,750
this film it just sort of shrugged and

1405
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,520
said whatever just give me some pleasing

1406
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,500
eye candy it didn't I didn't think too

1407
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,540
much of it but then later when I really

1408
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,400
thought about it it's hard to piss me

1409
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,400
off like really piss me off I thought

1410
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,500
about what they were trying to do to one

1411
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,570
of the great villains one of the great

1412
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,360
Disney icons turning the mistress of all

1413
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,060
evil into a simple case of

1414
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,930
misunderstanding turning three of the

1415
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,910
most likable comic relief's into these

1416
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,970
idiotic morons turning an iconic Disney

1417
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,190
fairy tale that has its flaws but was

1418
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,230
still pretty damn creative into every

1419
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,710
other poorly CG stale story that comes

1420
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,230
out about fairy tales nowadays you know

1421
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,350
what this movie really sucks a lot we

1422
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:05,550
start off with the backstory of

1423
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,230
Maleficent as a little girl who

1424
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,780
apparently had wings originally okay

1425
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,120
this is because she was a fairy all

1426
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,160
right well she looked kind of cool so

1427
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,050
we'll go with it she then meets a human

1428
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,180
boy and they grow up falling in love but

1429
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,590
then he finds out when he's older that

1430
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,870
if he kills Maleficent he'll be given

1431
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,510
unbelievable power but he can't quite do

1432
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,500
that because he's too nice I guess so he

1433
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,750
decides to cut off her wings instead she

1434
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,580
decides from this day on that she hates

1435
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,010
all humanity and is just gonna be evil

1436
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,990
years later the King marries and

1437
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,730
eventually has a daughter and you know

1438
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,830
how this goes Maleficent comes to the

1439
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,630
party curses the daughter and says when

1440
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,690
she turns 16

1441
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,250
prick her finger on a spinning wheel and

1442
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,140
die once again the fairies are called in

1443
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,420
to take her away and raise her but get a

1444
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,200
load of this

1445
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,569
Maleficent always knows where the baby

1446
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:55,240
is and because the fairies are too

1447
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,940
stupid to raise a child Maleficent

1448
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,089
actually kind of raises her herself cuz

1449
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:04,329
you know she's not so bad after all once

1450
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,130
the child grows up she eventually bumps

1451
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,180
into Prince Charming

1452
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,920
they fall in love and all this time

1453
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,630
Olympus and is not only watching but

1454
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,520
actually getting on pretty good with her

1455
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,670
because yeah this is what we want to see

1456
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,440
one of the greatest villains of all time

1457
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,560
having Girl Talk talking about feelings

1458
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,730
chewing laughing having all sorts of fun

1459
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:26,859
look am i watching it finally gets to a

1460
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:28,990
point where Maleficent does and what the

1461
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,390
friend says to die so she knocks out the

1462
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,770
prince and tries to get them back

1463
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,569
together because if she does fall in

1464
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,220
love that pricks her finger maybe he can

1465
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,470
wake her up and meanwhile the King has

1466
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,010
gone crazy just because any vows to set

1467
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,810
a trap for Maleficent yeah kind of a

1468
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,819
shock he didn't do that before so it's a

1469
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:48,310
battle between Maleficent the hero and

1470
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,859
the princess's father the villain yeah I

1471
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:53,079
can tell they really got the idea about

1472
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:54,940
what Disney's Sleeping Beauty was all

1473
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,220
about I won't give away what happens in

1474
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,750
the end but remember what they did in

1475
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,300
frozen with the true love thing and how

1476
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,650
they did a little bit of a twist on it

1477
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,560
yeah they do they here too except it was

1478
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,089
already done in frozen so it's not

1479
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:08,920
really a twist anymore I guess there's

1480
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,990
one or two good things in this some of

1481
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,869
the visuals are a little neat most of

1482
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:15,369
them are pretty standard and not

1483
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:17,500
rendered very well visually Jolie was

1484
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,450
pretty cool as Maleficent she's got that

1485
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,130
devilish smile and a cool look here or

1486
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,599
there but while their acting is not

1487
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,310
really bad it's not really anything that

1488
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,740
great either the actor playing the King

1489
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,270
is awful

1490
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:31,390
I mean really bad I guess he's supposed

1491
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,250
to be like this really complex character

1492
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,900
but he just sort of has these weird mood

1493
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,569
swings and out of nowhere goes nuts and

1494
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:39,430
none of it's convincing and it all

1495
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,800
sounds so silly they brought you back a

1496
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,790
date you said I told those three idiots

1497
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,859
lock it up you know do something about

1498
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:49,720
his voice I can't explain it I don't

1499
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,280
know if it's the inflections or the

1500
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,410
pitch or whatever but he just annoys the

1501
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,520
crap

1502
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,730
she's only sleeping forever and

1503
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,250
everything else like I said is trying to

1504
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,110
turn this story into something it isn't

1505
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,630
which okay wicked did something like

1506
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,640
that and once upon a time did something

1507
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,140
like that and they seemed to work out

1508
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,270
okay but that's part of the problem they

1509
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,500
already did it

1510
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,240
if you're going to do it now you have to

1511
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,070
add something really new or really

1512
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,410
groundbreaking wicked have good writing

1513
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,810
and characters and music outside the

1514
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,250
fact that it was a twist on story we

1515
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,070
already know this is just so standard

1516
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,930
and not only that it takes characters

1517
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,850
that you already loved and instead of

1518
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,620
making them charming in a new way it

1519
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,510
just sucks out anything that made them

1520
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,200
unique

1521
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,350
the fairies good god I mean there's dumb

1522
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,930
and then there's just insultingly dump

1523
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,580
it's almost like the writer of this

1524
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,680
movie just didn't like the person who

1525
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,600
created the fairies originally or

1526
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,430
something and just really wanted to

1527
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,710
stick it to them I mean they are just so

1528
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,170
terribly written I know this is done so

1529
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,880
that Maleficent looks more like the star

1530
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,370
but come on this is downright degrading

1531
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,570
and like I said

1532
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,640
Maleficent herself is just not that

1533
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,340
interesting I guess this could be kind

1534
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,290
of a neat spin seeing how we all know

1535
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,630
the story and yeah it is kind of juicy

1536
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,490
with her getting her wings chopped off

1537
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,680
and hating all humanity and stuff and

1538
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,660
trying to go through a change but nobody

1539
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,970
is written with any charm or charisma I

1540
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,470
give the actors credit that they're

1541
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,960
trying to add charm and charisma but

1542
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,670
there's just so little to work off of

1543
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,310
nothing about a cries that somebody had

1544
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,500
this great idea and really want to tell

1545
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,660
this story in a brand new way that was

1546
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,250
gonna just change the way you look at

1547
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,200
everything it's obviously just trying to

1548
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,750
do what everybody else is doing and in

1549
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,000
the process it insults some of our

1550
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,460
greatest Disney characters the fairies

1551
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,690
were awesome don't try to make them

1552
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:38,320
stupid

1553
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,060
well episode was great don't try to make

1554
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,980
her good the Kings were charming don't

1555
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,870
try to make them this asshole I don't

1556
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,940
know if you want more reasons why I hate

1557
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,950
it go watch the honest trailers of it I

1558
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,600
guess if you're just looking for

1559
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,730
something that's kind of pretty a touch

1560
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,740
create that they remind you a little bit

1561
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,260
of those classic fairy tales then it's a

1562
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,480
harmless waste of time well if you're

1563
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,950
looking for something that's gonna suck

1564
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,480
you in and you can't wait what's gonna

1565
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,030
happen next and it's very psychological

1566
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,490
and intriguing and

1567
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,140
I don't know anything not stale and

1568
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,270
hasn't been done a million times then

1569
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,900
you can definitely give this one a pass

1570
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:22,500
[Music]

1571
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,290
[Music]

1572
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,140
it's Disney's runaway hit frozen just a

1573
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,030
little over a year since it came out and

1574
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:31,650
people still won't shut up about this

1575
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,290
movie it's a cultural phenomenon I have

1576
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,780
not seen an anime film from Disney get

1577
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,080
this much attention since Lion King

1578
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,010
everybody's still singing the songs

1579
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,600
everybody's still quoting the lines

1580
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,890
everybody's still selling the

1581
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,619
merchandise it's just a monster like

1582
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:48,510
probably most of you I kind of agree

1583
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,700
it's all over the place and most likely

1584
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,580
overplayed but I'm not gonna lie I'm one

1585
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,230
of those people that loves it just as

1586
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,390
much as anyone else the story is about

1587
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,580
two princesses named Elsa and Anna Elsa

1588
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,410
has a curse where she can control the

1589
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,050
cold she can make it snow shoot ice beam

1590
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,180
create snowmen all sorts of craziness

1591
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,980
but one night as a little kid she

1592
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,410
accidentally almost kills her sister her

1593
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,270
mom and dad take them to a group of Rock

1594
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,890
gnomes who say that they can save her

1595
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,630
but they had to keep the power a secret

1596
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,700
so they Arisa Anna's memory and decide

1597
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,260
that it's best to keep them as far apart

1598
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,420
as possible in hopes that our power

1599
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,500
won't hurt her anymore

1600
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,600
years go by and after the parents

1601
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,520
tragically die the two of them grow up

1602
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,840
into polar opposites

1603
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,820
Elsa not surprisingly is an awkward

1604
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,010
introvert and Anna is a social butterfly

1605
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,440
ready to open up to anybody on the day

1606
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,540
of Elsa's coronation as Queen Anna

1607
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,400
accidentally reveals Elsa's powers to

1608
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,500
everybody causing Elsa to run away and

1609
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,900
leave the entire kingdom in ice so it's

1610
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,640
up to Anna to find her sister and

1611
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,440
convince her to come back and stop all

1612
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,270
this winter along her way she comes

1613
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,770
across a climber named Kristoff a

1614
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,170
magical snowman named Olaf and all sorts

1615
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,700
of crazy adventures trying to not only

1616
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,440
save the kingdom but her sister as well

1617
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,780
there are so many things to talk about

1618
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,369
with this movie it's hard to know where

1619
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,410
to even start probably the thing I'm

1620
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,150
impressed with most is their ability to

1621
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,859
break certain cliches while still

1622
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:06,510
holding true to others that make Disney

1623
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,340
so popular but they do it in a way

1624
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,380
that's not so obvious it feels very

1625
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,150
natural in the way they set up these

1626
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,250
characters I thought back to films like

1627
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,170
Enchanted where they just hammered the

1628
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,339
lesson in that there

1629
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,289
going against these Disney cliches and

1630
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,690
here it just felt like it was part of a

1631
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,549
story they would tell even if it wasn't

1632
00:58:23,549 --> 00:58:25,529
Disney related because it ties in to

1633
00:58:25,529 --> 00:58:26,819
what's going on nowadays and will

1634
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:28,769
continue to happen in the future for

1635
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:30,299
example there is still a romance that

1636
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,249
blooms in only a few days but they also

1637
00:58:32,249 --> 00:58:33,900
Mock the fact that she's going to marry

1638
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,640
somebody that she just met which of

1639
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,200
course is a big criticism the female

1640
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,359
leads in the past but this also makes

1641
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,190
sense for the character she has been

1642
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,140
shut away for so long that she would

1643
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,210
just give herself to anybody it's a new

1644
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:47,190
experience and she would be excited but

1645
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,900
this movie is showing the dangers of it

1646
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,910
in fact originally I was kind of against

1647
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,019
the idea that they were sort of a

1648
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,969
last-minute villain thrown in but

1649
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,559
without giving away too much this once

1650
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,509
again shows a really good lesson the

1651
00:58:57,509 --> 00:58:59,339
surprise reveal shows the danger of

1652
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,920
being too trusting to anybody which is

1653
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,509
not only a good lesson for kids but a

1654
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:04,890
really good lesson for kids nowadays

1655
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:07,440
with the social media and everybody on

1656
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,779
it so often both Anna and Elsa are

1657
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,729
perfect extremes to learn something from

1658
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:13,769
Elsa is an introvert who wants to stay

1659
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:15,390
away from people much like how some

1660
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,589
people can just be glued to their

1661
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:18,450
computers and phones and not go outside

1662
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,219
that much people need to know how to

1663
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:21,779
socially interact if they're going to

1664
00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:23,819
survive but anna has the opposite

1665
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:25,890
problem if you reveal too much about

1666
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,420
yourself and will just give your heart

1667
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,670
to anybody again like a lot of people on

1668
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,440
the social media do there can be a

1669
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,630
downside to that as well the characters

1670
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,450
are also likable not only do we have two

1671
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,400
princesses in this but one of them moves

1672
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,190
on the Queen isn't evil is actually

1673
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,079
really respectable and smart and the

1674
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,269
other isn't so dainty and basic she's

1675
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:47,430
really really funny they don't mind if

1676
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,049
they make her a little bit of a ditzy er

1677
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:51,210
there because it's totally explained why

1678
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,789
the situation totally backs up why she

1679
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:55,440
would be this way but at the same time

1680
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,019
she's very likable you love her passion

1681
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:00,509
and there is something so nice knowing

1682
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:01,799
that the majority of the humor that

1683
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,390
comes from this movie comes from the

1684
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,219
main characters and not all just in

1685
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:07,469
comic relief the main characters can be

1686
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:10,079
funny and goofy but with that said even

1687
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,759
the obvious comic relief they do bring

1688
01:00:11,759 --> 01:00:13,979
in isn't really that bad I don't think

1689
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:16,619
Olaf is a hilarious character but I got

1690
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,210
a laugh out of him once in a while and

1691
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,309
he wasn't annoying where most Disney

1692
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:22,229
sidekicks get a lot of their humor from

1693
01:00:22,229 --> 01:00:24,269
yelling and being loud this one actually

1694
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:26,759
whispers a lot of his jokes I haven't

1695
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:28,559
really seen that in a Disney fairy tale

1696
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,510
and it's actually really effect

1697
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:33,660
funny the music what can I say you're

1698
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,970
all still humming these tunes let it go

1699
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,800
you want to build a snowman for the

1700
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,780
first time in forever I remember when I

1701
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,710
was first talking about these

1702
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,420
songwriters in the Winnie the Pooh movie

1703
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,520
and I said I so want them to go on to

1704
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,320
something cuz these are such great songs

1705
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,050
holy did they get rewarded for

1706
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,270
their talents people are still singing

1707
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,740
these songs they're releasing it in

1708
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,540
theaters with little sing-along lyrics

1709
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,670
at the bottom it's just insane how

1710
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,470
popular they are and what I love about

1711
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,690
too is that the songs helped the movie

1712
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,790
and tell the story that's what the

1713
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,220
Disney musicals did they didn't just say

1714
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,200
let's get a pop star like Elton John to

1715
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,180
write five songs that honestly if you

1716
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,290
took them out you wouldn't miss that

1717
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,330
much in terms of story or someone like

1718
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,250
Phil Collins who just sort of sings in

1719
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,570
the background that you could have just

1720
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,250
replaced with orchestral music and

1721
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,200
nothing would change whatsoever these

1722
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,000
are songs that actually explain what the

1723
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,530
characters are going through and move

1724
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,770
the story forward and they're done

1725
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:27,150
fantastically I know I did in this - a

1726
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,830
Craig video criticizing the fact that

1727
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,020
it's played all over the place and yeah

1728
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,600
it is I'm not gonna act like it isn't we

1729
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,040
are over playing it I'm sure it's

1730
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,050
driving most people insane but the sad

1731
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,640
truth is I'm one of those obnoxious

1732
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,340
people who plays it over and over that

1733
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,110
doesn't mean I won't make fun of it but

1734
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,000
yeah I'm one of those morons who does it

1735
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,890
but to be fair I only listen to it in my

1736
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,650
car without any kids to play it for

1737
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,790
actually does sound a really pathetic

1738
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,560
but I don't care I love the music that

1739
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,500
much the film is also gorgeous looking I

1740
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,850
could almost see people whipping this

1741
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,010
out around every Christmas look at the

1742
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,290
way they shoot winter look at the colors

1743
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,760
look at the angles look at the

1744
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,400
landscapes I could get lost in this

1745
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,200
winter I want to live in this winter

1746
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,780
which I know I kind of do but this one

1747
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,750
looks nicer if I did have a problem with

1748
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,820
anything I would say that the back story

1749
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,310
is really rushed I know for some people

1750
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,170
those elements can really turn them off

1751
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,000
as I've heard their major criticisms

1752
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,070
like why they did do this to the two

1753
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,660
little girls and shouldn't have grown

1754
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,790
them up this way and so on so forth and

1755
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,770
I get it it is kind of a plot hole and

1756
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:29,880
in the development of our main

1757
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,560
characters that sort of causes all this

1758
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,690
but personally I give it a little bit of

1759
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,460
a leeway because I say that's kind of a

1760
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,680
fairy tale element sort of like how is

1761
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,720
Luke Skywalker firing one torpedo gonna

1762
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,860
blow up the entire Death Star or how is

1763
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,600
the Joker took down the batplane with

1764
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,580
one bullet from his gun it's one of

1765
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,290
those treat of liberties that for me is

1766
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,880
worth going through to get to the best

1767
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,340
parts of the story with that said frozen

1768
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,590
is one of my top ten favorite Disney

1769
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,930
films he'll maybe even top five it

1770
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,850
brought me right back into that feeling

1771
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,620
that I was seeing something big and

1772
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,500
grand and Disney and on top of that it

1773
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,630
was a fairy tale when's the last time

1774
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,150
you saw a traditional fairy tale take

1775
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,340
the world by storm I don't mean

1776
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,230
something like tangle that was a hit or

1777
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,000
once upon a time that's doing well I

1778
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,180
mean like take over the world it's been

1779
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,640
a while but it's great to see again and

1780
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,130
yeah like I said it is probably being

1781
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,960
exploited a little too much and all over

1782
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,000
the place but hell I much rather have

1783
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,190
kids and adults rewatch this than stay

1784
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,040
transformers a twilight this one has so

1785
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,560
much more creativity and intelligence to

1786
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,380
it and music and visuals and characters

1787
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,330
and just I'm just gushing all over it

1788
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,250
again it's one of the few films I can

1789
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,560
just proclaim as an instant classic a

1790
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,510
film you can guarantee years from now

1791
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,280
millions of people are still gonna be

1792
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,930
watching and sharing with their kids

1793
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,630
hell with other adults I'd say go check

1794
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,090
it out but who the hell hasn't just go

1795
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,070
watch it again I know I'm going to and

1796
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,990
have a hell of a lot of fun doing it

1797
01:03:55,990 --> 01:04:11,720
[Music]

1798
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,280
[Music]

1799
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,170
it only figures to celebrate Christmas

1800
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:18,240
Day with a Christmas movie and the

1801
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,859
Muppet Christmas Carol seems to be a

1802
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,750
good one to talk about it's so

1803
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,400
interesting that for so many younger

1804
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,500
people this is their introduction to the

1805
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,300
classic Charles Dickens tale

1806
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,380
I shouldn't see that as a bad thing

1807
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,210
seeing how the Mickey Christmas Carol

1808
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:32,280
was my introduction to it and truth be

1809
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,200
told it's not a bad way to be introduced

1810
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,260
is it the best way no but I think it's

1811
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,940
still pretty reasonably well done

1812
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,980
Lebanese our Scrooge played by Michael

1813
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,770
Caine is the town's most hated man one

1814
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,420
of his workers Bob Cratchit played by

1815
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,250
Kermit the Frog and yes I know somebody

1816
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,510
else please come at the Frog but come on

1817
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,160
work with me here tries to get Christmas

1818
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,140
day off to spend with his family after

1819
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,210
Scrooge begrudgingly agrees he's told

1820
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:55,859
that he's going to be haunted by three

1821
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,990
ghosts that night the ghost of Christmas

1822
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,540
past present and future each one shows

1823
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,369
him exactly that the past president

1824
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:04,260
future and slowly over the course of the

1825
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,940
film Scrooge starts to realise the

1826
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,470
importance of Christmas the importance

1827
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,210
of being nice and the importance of

1828
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,010
sharing his wealth with puppets half his

1829
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,350
size the film is pretty by-the-book and

1830
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,240
following the original story they have

1831
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,770
gonzo and Rizzo as the narrators who

1832
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,330
constantly get beaten up throughout the

1833
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:20,250
entire movie and all the other Muppet

1834
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,840
characters play the parts that we know

1835
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,520
from the book the one that actually has

1836
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,920
me pissing my pants with laughter is

1837
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,980
fozziwig by God I swear this whole movie

1838
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,930
was put together just so they could do

1839
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:33,690
that pun on the whole it's a decent film

1840
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,880
especially when you look at the sets and

1841
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,130
the atmosphere and the colors it's clear

1842
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,020
the focus of the movie was not to tell a

1843
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,359
great Muppet film but rather a decent

1844
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,760
Christmas carol now the downside is some

1845
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,040
might find that as a turn off as someone

1846
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,170
who loves the Muppet movie and the

1847
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,119
Muppet Caper in their early films I

1848
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,650
really thought there was going to be a

1849
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,750
lot more humour to this like if you saw

1850
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,430
the Muppets do a Christmas carol on say

1851
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:58,619
The Muppet Show you know everything

1852
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,420
would go wrong their personalities will

1853
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,460
get in the way and be all crazy and

1854
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,990
stuff will be blowing up and falling

1855
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:06,210
apart but here it's got to be done more

1856
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,460
seriously which isn't a bad thing I

1857
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,520
guess it just doesn't feel that Muppet

1858
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,420
is half the time

1859
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,250
but even that's made up for when they do

1860
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,870
something actually a little different

1861
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,120
from the story stuff that maybe other

1862
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,250
versions should consider put again one

1863
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,960
of my favorite additions is that the

1864
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,790
ghost of Christmas present has a bad

1865
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:26,070
memory why because he's always living in

1866
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:26,760
the present

1867
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,470
so sometimes he'll repeat things like

1868
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:30,390
he'll introduce himself twice or say his

1869
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,430
sentence he already said that's a really

1870
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,800
clever idea I also love the design of

1871
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,690
the ghost of Christmas past that's kind

1872
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:39,270
of a baby but kind of an adult too is

1873
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,670
sort of ageless but there are definitely

1874
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:42,870
some moments there are by no means

1875
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,970
terrible but can definitely be a little

1876
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,070
awkward well the songs for the most part

1877
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,620
are pretty damn good some of them almost

1878
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,930
sound a little too cleaned up

1879
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,970
like the love is gone is sunk almost a

1880
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:56,280
little too nice you almost miss the

1881
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,410
emotion of it and let's get to the part

1882
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,790
that's really gonna make you want to

1883
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,130
kill me I don't think Michael Caine is

1884
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,100
that greatest group you heard right I

1885
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,140
don't think he's awful but there are

1886
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,030
just so many moments where I feel like

1887
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:11,370
he's really just phoning it in for

1888
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,840
example what the is this it just

1889
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,210
cracks me up how weird it is there's

1890
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,980
also some line deliveries that just feel

1891
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,470
lazy to me if I look at this scene we

1892
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:24,450
just sort of calls Bob Cratchit's name

1893
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,910
and it just sounds like really bad

1894
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:32,070
acting mr. Scrooge Bob Bob Cratchit does

1895
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:33,600
anyone else feel that was just kind of

1896
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,330
half-assed but the biggest scene and I

1897
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,130
mean quite literally the biggest scene

1898
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:40,440
is when he's supposed to break down and

1899
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,930
change his ways there's no big music

1900
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,000
there's no big visuals for it it all

1901
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,730
just relies on his performance and I'm

1902
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,580
sorry it doesn't deliver I don't feel a

1903
01:07:50,580 --> 01:08:01,040
thing for this guy present in the future

1904
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,320
I don't entirely blame him as the

1905
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,420
staging and pacing in the scene is kind

1906
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,640
of weird too but I think of all the

1907
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,190
other Scrooge's and how I felt so bad

1908
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,170
for them and they just made this such a

1909
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:15,960
huge scene and here it's just a guy who

1910
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,390
looks like he's trying to be sad while

1911
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,640
saying some lines but with all that

1912
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,560
I'd say only about half of the

1913
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,420
performance is not very good there

1914
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,220
actually is a half that's pretty decent

1915
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,290
and strangely enough a lot of it's in

1916
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,570
the musical numbers Michael Caine is not

1917
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,640
a very good singer but he actually does

1918
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,560
put a lot of passion when he's doing the

1919
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,630
singing roles he actually does feel very

1920
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,420
jubilant wasting in the final song and I

1921
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,220
really love the addition of having him

1922
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,170
sing a duet with the version of his past

1923
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:46,780
love that's a great idea and he does it

1924
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:49,150
very well he also has the threatening

1925
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:51,280
look and stamina of a proper Scrooge so

1926
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,490
I can't say he's terrible because when

1927
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:56,740
he does something good it is good but

1928
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,180
for me it's only about half the

1929
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,160
performance I don't know it could very

1930
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,380
well be that I love Christmas carols so

1931
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,150
much and I love the character of Scrooge

1932
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,580
that I really really hold them to a high

1933
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,830
standard in fact honestly I can probably

1934
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,870
count on my one hand how many great

1935
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,550
Scrooge's I think that really are that

1936
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,470
I've seen but still that's not what

1937
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,970
you're coming to see you're coming to

1938
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:18,520
see the Muppets and the Muppets do fine

1939
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,320
even though I don't feel like it's a

1940
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,450
traditional Muppet movie I do kind of

1941
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,980
give it credit that it tried to do

1942
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:26,020
something really serious they still

1943
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,610
address a lot of the dark stuff they

1944
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,430
still kill off Tiny Tim this could so

1945
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,730
easily be awkward and laughably done but

1946
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:36,490
it's actually pretty legit and yeah like

1947
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,230
a lot of people I watch it every year

1948
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,690
too it's a strange combo but a decent

1949
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:42,820
one the kids will enjoy the puppets the

1950
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,590
adults will enjoy the jokes and the

1951
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,320
Christmas lovers will enjoy Christmas

1952
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,060
have a wonderful holiday and possibly

1953
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,479
pop this film in

1954
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:56,220
[Music]

1955
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:08,590
[Music]

1956
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,740
[Music]

1957
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,960
ever since the movie came out everyone's

1958
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,820
been telling me you gotta see big hero

1959
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,070
six you gotta see big hero six all the

1960
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,660
critics loved it all the audience's

1961
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,460
loved it then the number one movie for a

1962
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,410
couple weeks it's just incredible oh my

1963
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:23,860
god

1964
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,500
 big hero six naturally I got

1965
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,540
pretty excited to see Disney do kind of

1966
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,370
a superhero film as well I really

1967
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,110
thought about it I don't think we've

1968
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,730
actually seen one from them

1969
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,290
I mean we've definitely seen heroes in

1970
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:37,360
their movies but not as much comic-book

1971
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,000
characters I paid my ticket went on in

1972
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,610
and let me tell you I have never felt an

1973
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:45,190
overwhelming sensation that a film was

1974
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:50,140
100% okay it's honestly hard to think of

1975
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,450
what else to even say about it it's okay

1976
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,640
how's the fighting it's okay

1977
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,680
how are the characters they're okay how

1978
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,870
are the visuals they're okay to be

1979
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:01,660
honest I'm really dumbfounded why so

1980
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,700
many people are talking about this film

1981
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:07,090
it's not bad it's not good it's just

1982
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,660
okay it's about the most standard

1983
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:13,210
superhero film I've seen in a while not

1984
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:16,120
that it has nothing new it's just all

1985
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,060
the new stuff is okay the film takes

1986
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,590
place in the future with a boy named

1987
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,900
Hiro Hiro is a boy genius who has an

1988
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,430
older brother who's also a boy genius

1989
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,740
but Hiro is also walking that thin line

1990
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,480
of applying himself to do great things

1991
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,060
or just using it to benefit himself so

1992
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,770
his brother introduces him to a team of

1993
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,960
other super geniuses and he decides he

1994
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,790
wants to be a part of it but again to

1995
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,530
the school that they're all in he has to

1996
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,510
win this competition sure enough he

1997
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,010
comes up with an invention that wins

1998
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,290
everybody's eye but loses everything in

1999
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,660
a fire including his brother a long time

2000
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,950
later he comes across one of his

2001
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:49,840
brothers inventions named baymax baymax

2002
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,600
is kind of like a one robot Hospital

2003
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,220
he's designed to help people who are in

2004
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,440
physical or even mental pain but sure

2005
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,360
enough Hiro sees an opportunity to put

2006
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,340
this machine to good use when he sees

2007
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,140
there's a masked villain who's using his

2008
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,000
invention for evil it's up to Hiro

2009
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,280
baymax and his newfound team of geniuses

2010
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,620
to not only find out what's going on but

2011
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,700
to do it as what else a super team

2012
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,160
not gonna lie literally I predicted who

2013
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,080
was gonna die who was gonna be the

2014
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,240
villain and even how the movie was gonna

2015
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,370
end I wouldn't usually mind as it's more

2016
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,260
part of the journey but this movie

2017
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,510
seemed really bent on surprising us with

2018
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,420
its twist as well as its comedy and both

2019
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,910
were unbelievably predictable it was

2020
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,530
really strange to see all these

2021
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:34,080
characters that seem to be designed well

2022
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,120
but I felt like I've seen them in a

2023
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,650
million other projects

2024
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,140
you got the stoner loser you got the

2025
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,360
hyper geek you got the cool one who

2026
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,430
chews the bubblegum and most of their

2027
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,870
dialogue is just centered around the

2028
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,190
fact that they're making catchphrases

2029
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:49,290
that they're gonna repeat later and when

2030
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,770
they do it is so Forrest and don't get

2031
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,390
me wrong I know a lot of these superhero

2032
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,300
stories have a lot of that traditional

2033
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,590
manipulation saying catchphrases

2034
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,330
defeating supervillains all that good

2035
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,070
stuff but superhero films have come a

2036
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:05,310
long way recently movies like Batman The

2037
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,990
Dark Knight and of course all the

2038
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,460
incredible Marvel movies are coming out

2039
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,440
now which ironically this is a part of

2040
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,690
our light-years beyond what this movie

2041
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:14,400
is trying to do the only thing that

2042
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,020
sticks out about it at all which I guess

2043
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,730
is kind of traditional Disney is the

2044
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,200
relationship between Hiro and baymax

2045
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,200
it's cute simple that never seems to go

2046
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,100
to forest

2047
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,930
baymax seems to keep to his exact

2048
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,970
programming yet we still feel something

2049
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,920
for it's not like he breaks it and says

2050
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,540
he wants to be human or something he

2051
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,280
just stays the exact being that he's

2052
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,050
supposed to be the best parts of the

2053
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,760
movie are with him trying to help Hiro

2054
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,040
deal with his loss when the movie focus

2055
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,080
is on that element it's good but when it

2056
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,210
tries to actually be a superhero film

2057
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,730
it's kind of dull it's not like there's

2058
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:46,920
no imagination put into it it's just

2059
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,260
imagination I've seen in a million other

2060
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,360
places it's not like I didn't see

2061
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,880
characters I just kind of saw characters

2062
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,460
that were ten years behind the curve but

2063
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,990
like I said I can't think of anything

2064
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:00,930
that was awful it was just kind of

2065
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,970
predictable and kind of been done before

2066
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:07,500
like a lot even San Fran Tokyo what an

2067
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,720
idea combining these two cities together

2068
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,679
what I mean

2069
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:14,370
look at it it's creative it's not lazy

2070
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,980
or anything but doesn't it also can't

2071
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,170
look like a million other futuristic

2072
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,810
cities you've seen before with a million

2073
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:23,460
other characters you've kind of already

2074
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,920
seen before maybe if they kept it more

2075
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,690
simple just focusing on the boy in the

2076
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:29,400
robot I would have enjoyed it a lot more

2077
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,640
as is it's just all right

2078
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,560
nothing terrible nothing spectacular

2079
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,409
just alright but maybe that's not what

2080
01:14:37,409 --> 01:14:39,090
you'll think maybe you'll go and see it

2081
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,620
a spectacular like the majority of

2082
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,630
people do fair enough there's nothing

2083
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,670
really that bad in it maybe I'm just not

2084
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:45,989
the right person who can see the

2085
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:48,060
greatness in it if you're really curious

2086
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:59,780
check it out for yourself

2087
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,419
[Music]

2088
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:04,699
okay so I'm going a little out of order

2089
01:15:04,699 --> 01:15:06,649
on this one but at the same time I

2090
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:08,689
couldn't get into into the woods in time

2091
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:11,179
to do a Disney assembler for it and yeah

2092
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:12,949
I'll just do it by popular demand in

2093
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:15,079
January but until then let's do one I

2094
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,550
actually have gotten a lot of requests

2095
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,459
to do The Brave Little Toaster a film a

2096
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:22,459
million times better than its deserving

2097
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:25,189
to be I mean just listen to that title

2098
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:27,559
The Brave Little Toaster this sounds

2099
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:29,389
like a story for one year olds that

2100
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:31,550
should have little to no effort put into

2101
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:34,309
it and even the set up in some respects

2102
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:36,079
is kind of like that to a bunch of

2103
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:38,449
appliances with eyes mouths the whole

2104
01:15:38,449 --> 01:15:40,130
thing had been sitting around the house

2105
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:42,380
waiting for their master to return but a

2106
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,179
long amount of time has passed and is

2107
01:15:44,179 --> 01:15:45,469
starting to feel like he's never going

2108
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:47,239
to come back fearing he might be in

2109
01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:49,010
trouble they decide to leave the home

2110
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,929
and go looking for him the rest of the

2111
01:15:50,929 --> 01:15:52,820
film is the great big journey they take

2112
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,590
to try and find where he's gone

2113
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,630
our characters include a radio played by

2114
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:58,880
Jon Lovitz a vacuum an electric blanket

2115
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,130
a lamp and of course our Brave Little

2116
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:04,119
Toaster for a setup that sounds almost

2117
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:06,919
insultingly simple it's really kind of

2118
01:16:06,919 --> 01:16:08,899
surprising how much effort they put into

2119
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:11,300
it there's a lot of quieter moments in

2120
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,070
this movie which when I saw is a little

2121
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,469
kid I was really impressed by it kind of

2122
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:17,030
made me feel more adult to watch

2123
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,709
something that wasn't constantly trying

2124
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:21,709
to be loud and singing and obnoxious it

2125
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:23,719
can let softer moments just be softer

2126
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:25,669
moments oh that's it there's definitely

2127
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,559
a lot of craziness at two they come

2128
01:16:27,559 --> 01:16:29,689
across a lot of neat characters a lot of

2129
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:32,059
wonderful designs a lot of scary designs

2130
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:34,309
and even a few hummable musical moments

2131
01:16:34,309 --> 01:16:37,159
I especially loved the garbage dump song

2132
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,989
it has a really good beat to it it even

2133
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:40,699
years later I once in awhile catch

2134
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:52,390
myself humming it

2135
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,890
one of the fun things about that you

2136
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,660
know I would enjoy is that there's a lot

2137
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,210
of scary scenes in it yeah for something

2138
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,010
called The Brave Little Toaster there's

2139
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:02,739
a lot of really creepy intense moments

2140
01:17:02,739 --> 01:17:04,660
look at this climax this is pretty

2141
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,160
 hardcore for a little kids film

2142
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,949
[Music]

2143
01:17:10,949 --> 01:17:13,540
but even beyond that the characters are

2144
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:15,640
actually kind of enjoyable they're all

2145
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,070
really simple but really unique and

2146
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:19,780
distinct they all kind of come together

2147
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,820
and help each other out as a group and

2148
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,320
they all have their moments to shine I

2149
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,480
really appreciate this film not just for

2150
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,250
being enjoyable but for taking an idea

2151
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,380
that pretty much had nothing going for

2152
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,449
it and just putting their damnedest into

2153
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:34,090
it this is not a lazy project this is

2154
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:35,680
something that people came together said

2155
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,600
you know what this is weird this is odd

2156
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,130
but we're gonna do everything that we

2157
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,830
can with it it's a good film okay not

2158
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:43,870
phenomenal but I don't know what kind of

2159
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,489
phenomenal things you can really do with

2160
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:47,380
this set up hell I'm amazed they even

2161
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,870
made it to okay standards this is a fun

2162
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,730
little adventure to take your kids on it

2163
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:53,860
has enough colorful songs and characters

2164
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,690
to keep them interested and enough scary

2165
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:57,699
moments to get them going ooh what's

2166
01:17:57,699 --> 01:17:59,560
gonna happen next it's not spectacular

2167
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,270
but there's just something to the

2168
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:03,489
atmosphere I really like about it every

2169
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:04,960
action they make you feel the

2170
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,940
consequences of and you're totally

2171
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:08,199
rooting for them every step of the way

2172
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:10,300
with a helmet I thought toasters would

2173
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,920
leave such interesting lives

2174
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,170
[Applause]

2175
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:23,820
[Music]

2176
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,370
[Music]

2177
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:28,440
by popular demand it's into the woods

2178
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,680
the famous Stephen Sondheim musical

2179
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,550
actually saw this play in the theater

2180
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,380
appreciation class once I remember

2181
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,660
thinking wow this is incredibly clever

2182
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,510
and really smart but it's kind of not

2183
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:40,380
really my thing

2184
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,090
I knew the music was great and in many

2185
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:43,200
respects it was ahead of its time

2186
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,000
throwing these twists on fairytales that

2187
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,220
now seem to be everywhere but it's not

2188
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,050
something I listen to over and over and

2189
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:51,360
over however I also never thought they

2190
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,740
would make a movie out of it because

2191
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,020
well it's one of the hardest adaptations

2192
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,150
you can do on top of so many characters

2193
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:59,100
there's a bunch of different tones and a

2194
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,590
lot of uncomfortable adult themes and a

2195
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:03,030
lot of dark elements that really

2196
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,650
wouldn't mix well with the movie-going

2197
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,330
audience that's looking more for a

2198
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,070
musical comedy in this kind of setup

2199
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:10,560
does it pay off well let's look at the

2200
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,320
story or stories I should say it's

2201
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,970
pretty much all of the classic fairy

2202
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:16,560
tale characters we'll be riding hood

2203
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,540
Jack in the Beanstalk Cinderella and so

2204
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,370
forth every one of them starts off

2205
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,900
wishing for something greater than what

2206
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,880
they have Cinderella wants to go to the

2207
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,190
ball Rapunzel wants to be free so on and

2208
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,990
so forth a good chunk of the focus is on

2209
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,520
the baker and his wife who just want to

2210
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,920
have a child but a crazy witch played by

2211
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,690
Meryl Streep comes in and lets them know

2212
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,310
that the reason she can't have a child

2213
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,350
is because she cursed them because of a

2214
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:38,940
terrible act the Baker's father did

2215
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,860
years ago in order to relieve the curse

2216
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,390
they have to get all sorts of various

2217
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:44,130
items that tie into the other fairy tale

2218
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,080
characters and in a very short amount of

2219
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,090
time everybody's running around singing

2220
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:50,040
songs trying to get their goals done and

2221
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,020
when everything seems resolved and fixed

2222
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,820
it turns out we're only at the halfway

2223
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,710
point suddenly all they're achieved

2224
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,660
goals and happily ever after as it turns

2225
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,430
out isn't what they were looking for or

2226
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,500
didn't turn out like they expected thus

2227
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,790
the second half of the movie is actually

2228
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,230
trying to pick up the problems of the

2229
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:05,820
original problems that they had in the

2230
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,830
first half kind of a strange story

2231
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,770
layout for a movie huh especially one

2232
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,150
that's based on a two-and-a-half-hour

2233
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,280
musical and that is the film's biggest

2234
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,950
problem this is obviously meant for our

2235
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,230
Broadway crowd with a Broadway audience

2236
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,430
you know there's gonna be an

2237
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,930
intermission so when you get to the

2238
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,490
halfway point it looks like everyone's

2239
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,130
gonna live happily ever after

2240
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,510
it's really funny to hear the narrator

2241
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,179
say end of part 1 with a movie however

2242
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:30,800
you're thinking it's really going to end

2243
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,360
and you're gonna go home soon and now

2244
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,440
you're sort of disappointed where you

2245
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,449
find out there's at least 45 minutes

2246
01:20:35,449 --> 01:20:37,610
left and remember at that point a lot of

2247
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:38,570
people were checking their watches

2248
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,760
saying good lord how long is this movie

2249
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,650
and the irony is I actually liked the

2250
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,210
second half more than the first half

2251
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,800
despite the fact that they cut a lot out

2252
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,350
but again I can see why it's a movie

2253
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,210
going audience and this is really tough

2254
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,949
to keep people's attention when it's set

2255
01:20:51,949 --> 01:20:53,780
up like this this either needed an

2256
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,550
intermission or needed to be two movies

2257
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,620
and honestly I can't see that happening

2258
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,630
in this day and age not with into the

2259
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,610
woods well also the actors are good

2260
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,230
including Meryl Streep who's really

2261
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,969
yucking it up she reminds me of Glenn

2262
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:07,070
Close from 101 Dalmatians but it still

2263
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,510
has those softer moments too

2264
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:11,810
the tone is all over the place things

2265
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,280
that the original show had settle or

2266
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,900
suddenly made extreme and things that

2267
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,310
the show had extreme are suddenly made

2268
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,139
subtle and sometimes they work sometimes

2269
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,659
they don't but to be honest even in the

2270
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:22,969
Broadway play it was kind of hard to get

2271
01:21:22,969 --> 01:21:24,860
a feel for it the original show had

2272
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,810
really goofy stuff like at some point

2273
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:29,030
they feed the narrator to a giant that's

2274
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,830
really funny but then at other points

2275
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,630
some main characters die off and in

2276
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,400
really tragic ways and they sing these

2277
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,080
really sad songs about it's like wait a

2278
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,699
minute didn't we just get rid of the

2279
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:39,380
narrator a second ago breaking the

2280
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,179
fourth wall how do these two things mix

2281
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:42,860
back then I was very new and

2282
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,929
experimental for Broadway especially

2283
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:46,670
considering the original fairy tales but

2284
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,679
in a film this is really hard to

2285
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:50,870
transfer over in fact a lot of the

2286
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,610
comedy is sucked out to replace it with

2287
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,889
a lot of really heavy adult elements

2288
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:57,100
like abandonment issues adultery

2289
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,270
separation anxiety mommy and daddy

2290
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:01,520
issues death of a pet death of a family

2291
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,500
member death of a friend

2292
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,219
responsibilities of husband and wife

2293
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:06,080
don't get me wrong the original musicals

2294
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,429
are had these undertones with the big

2295
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:09,080
bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood but

2296
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,179
good guy Johnny Depp in this version

2297
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:13,070
they take those undertones and turn it

2298
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,170
into holy in your face how could

2299
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:17,030
this be mistaken for anything else

2300
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:19,639
overtones even the song Red Riding Hood

2301
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:21,409
sings to the hunter afterwards I now

2302
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:23,480
hear in a totally different way and it's

2303
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,060
really uncomfortable on the one hand I

2304
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:27,530
give them credit that they went full

2305
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:30,409
force and just did it but yeah this is

2306
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:31,550
weird

2307
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:33,320
so hearing all this you probably think I

2308
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,380
really don't like the movie and yeah

2309
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,330
the whole I don't think it works and

2310
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:39,400
dink why come together but at the same

2311
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,920
time it is such a tough adaptation and

2312
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,630
as someone who did find the show

2313
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,760
interesting I don't regret seeing it

2314
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,350
because I wanted to see how they were

2315
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:49,240
gonna try and do a lot of this and some

2316
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,310
of the choices are very clever I really

2317
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:52,930
like the visuals when you see Red Riding

2318
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,130
Hood and the grandma and the wolf's

2319
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,050
stomach that was really creative I love

2320
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,610
the way the atmosphere really captures

2321
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,140
the characters emotions in the second

2322
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,000
half just strange because the first half

2323
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,800
that has all the Giants of running

2324
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,630
around and fantasy stuff is actually

2325
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:06,910
played very safe not that much grand

2326
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,770
creativity it's mostly just done in

2327
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,560
medium shots but even then some things

2328
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,360
that work like every mare there's a song

2329
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,620
where Cinderella's trying to think about

2330
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,660
what to do and they actually freeze time

2331
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,920
that was a cool effect

2332
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,210
there's another great shot when giant

2333
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:20,620
Depp howls like a wolf and we get this

2334
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,600
cool silhouette I really wanted more of

2335
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,490
those but for the couple that we got it

2336
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,320
wasn't that bad the real star of the

2337
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,480
movie is the music I think that is one

2338
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,980
of the advantages to the film being so

2339
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,570
straightforward in the way it's shot is

2340
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:33,910
that it allows the music to really excel

2341
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,770
you're not really being distracted by

2342
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,450
all these crazy visuals being thrown at

2343
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,280
you you're constantly listening to the

2344
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,320
nice melodies and the clever lyrics and

2345
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,670
like I said even though the second half

2346
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:44,530
has a lot of the songs cut out they

2347
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:46,270
still sound pretty nice I was really

2348
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,620
shocked at how well Meryl Streep did

2349
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,360
with some of the slower songs I know she

2350
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,560
doesn't always get the pitch or the

2351
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,630
notes right but I thought she sold it

2352
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,430
okay in between all the other goofy

2353
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,080
scenes she has indoors so what I

2354
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:56,830
recommend it

2355
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:59,350
only if you're curious to see how the

2356
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,780
Broadway show is adapted because it is

2357
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,610
need to check out if you're curious

2358
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:05,620
about the choices they make or what they

2359
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,440
leave in or take away it's neat to see

2360
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,210
as an experiment but if you're looking

2361
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,980
for a completed work that masterfully

2362
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,020
mixes the complex with the simple this

2363
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,780
doesn't quite balance out I'm glad I saw

2364
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:19,030
it but more just to see how they did it

2365
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:21,070
it's by no means awful and I appreciate

2366
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:22,930
a lot of what they tried to do and I'm

2367
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,310
happy at the moments when it really did

2368
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:26,860
succeed but it's definitely a mess and

2369
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,810
to its credit I don't know how I would

2370
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,060
fix it do you cut out more do you add

2371
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,500
more do you make it more visually

2372
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,090
interesting or do you play it down even

2373
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:36,580
more so the music shines it's all over I

2374
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,080
don't know this musical ever can

2375
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,060
properly be turned into a good film but

2376
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,370
it was a valiant attempt and sometimes I

2377
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:43,990
don't mind checking those out if you're

2378
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,310
in the right mood or just a little

2379
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:47,110
curious give it a chance and see their

2380
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:47,610
best
