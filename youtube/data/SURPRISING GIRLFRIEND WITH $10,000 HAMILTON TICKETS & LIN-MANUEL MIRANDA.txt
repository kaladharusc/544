18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
you read my phone literally last night

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,719
you were like looking over my phone as

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,680
it was coming in and I was like yo

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,789
what's up guys I hope you're doing well

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,260
so for a while now Trish has been

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,940
obsessed with Hamilton when I met her I

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,620
was like oh yeah you like Hamilton cool

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,840
cool I was like I like Hamilton too but

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,489
then as I continued to date her I

27
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,049
realized it was like much more than just

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,030
liking Hamilton she's like when we go in

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,040
the car that's all she listens to that's

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,110
all she talks about and a few months ago

31
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,840
the creator of Hamilton lin-manuel

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,240
Miranda announced that he was going to

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,640
be reprising his role in Hamilton in

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,299
Puerto Rico in January of 2019 to try

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,520
and bring some relief to so many people

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,220
who are hurting there so he's doing a

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,710
bunch of shows Trisha asked me she was

38
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,509
like I want to go see lin-manuel Miranda

39
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,670
in Puerto Rico and I was like no I don't

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,079
want to go there I was like I've seen

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,970
Hamilton three times already I don't

42
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,530
want to see it again I don't really want

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,150
to go to Puerto Rico I don't really care

44
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,220
that much about Hamilton so she kind of

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,020
dropped it oh and not only that they

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,500
were offering the VIP experience which

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,079
is you can go to the show and then after

48
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,689
you can meet lin-manuel Miranda and

49
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,240
there's you have dinner with him by chef

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,439
Jose Andres these tickets are $5,000 a

51
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,240
pop interest was like do you want to go

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,530
and I was like no I don't want to go I

53
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,930
don't want to spend $5,000 so we kind of

54
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,719
just dropped it well Christmas was

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,580
coming around and I didn't know what to

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,229
get her

57
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,849
and I was kind of like alright well I

58
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,440
know Shirley wants to do that they don't

59
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,659
want to spend that much but it is going

60
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,330
to hurricane relief and it is tax

61
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,629
deductible so I have in my hands right

62
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,879
now two VIP tickets to Hamilton on

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,580
January some other 2019 meet lin-manuel

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,069

65
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,810
Andres who's like a big-time chef all

66
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,769

67
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,120
surprise we're gonna head over there

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,569

70
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,299

figure out $10,000 no but we're super

72
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,700
excited and the money is going to the

73
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,829
hurricane relief victims which is really

74
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,030
important so I decided to bite the

75
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,049
bullet and buy these tickets and

76
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,280
