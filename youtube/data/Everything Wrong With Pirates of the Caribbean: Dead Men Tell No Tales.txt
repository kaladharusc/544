1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,820
oh goes locos before your lame movie

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,139
what are these tally marks keeping track

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,849
up obviously aren't days mind if he's

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:15,870
keeping track of something wouldn't you

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,190
at least add up the tallies for each

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,990
month this kid dies a rock to his ankles

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,730
so that he'll be sunk into the sea land

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,350
on the Flying Dutchman and cause the

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,279
ship to float to the surface

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,289
how tha does he know this will work also

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,820
I know we're supposed to remember all

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,900
the stuff at the end of Pirates of the

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,070
Caribbean the curse of the dead

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,660
strangers chests at World's End but are

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,070
you telling me that if one visit will

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,390
was able to tell Henry all about the

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,040
Dutchman's whereabouts and how to get it

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,610
to the surface

19
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,079
we'll be severely overestimates my

20
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,489
desire to keep track of which ship is

21
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,890
which after four movies they know your

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,570
hair the real question is why aren't

23
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,219
they already on deck ship made a pretty

24
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,379
dramatic rise to the surface also either

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,760
captain of this ship now why does it

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
matter if they know he's here I thought

27
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,820
you took over after the third movie I

28
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,010
want you to come home and this kid

29
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,750
really feels a lot of love for a guy

30
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,969
he's seen one time in his life also why

31
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,379
did he come here and risk his life just

32
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,609
to tell his dad he knows something that

33
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,079
can break his curse without getting that

34
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,060
thing first so about those guys you were

35
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,650
worried about a minute ago did they get

36
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,180
lost on the way to do whatever you were

37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,799
worried about them doing so despite it

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,210
not having any kind of anchor and being

39
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,710
pushed aside by the week of the flying

40
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,509
Dutchman's ascent this tiny boat is

41
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,830
still just hanging out waiting for a

42
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,580
little Henry back in the day human

43
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,350
hearing was so good they could detect

44
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,970
someone yelling overall the cannon fire

45
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,610
and hundreds of men shouting and I sold

46
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,960
them all the Disney's so they could make

47
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,520
more god-awful sequels in this franchise

48
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,540
for at least the next 50 years

49
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,280
this one is clearly disturbed why

50
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,110
haven't you tackled him yet why has he

51
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,790
been allowed to speak this long IRA to

52
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,950
the Caribbean at World War Z Zend of all

53
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,750
the jail joints and all the ships in all

54
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,720
the seas he walks into mine for too many

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,610
years the Dragon Boat classic curse

56
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,770
that's the key to our escape he's

57
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,979
bottled us which people it's Jesus

58
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,479
Christ the setup for this movie is no

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,740
different than the first one and really

60
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,939
how many of these movies are gonna have

61
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,320
some cursed ship with a bunch of dead

62
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,890
semi dead and undead dudes on it

63
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,060
[Music]

64
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,140
because in this very movie he'll give

65
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,370
away his compass which will somehow

66
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,260
bring me daylight and do nothing else in

67
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,810
particular right

68
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,940
honestly Henry could simply not tell

69
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,530
Jack about Salazar at all and he'd be

70
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,030
totally okay there's absolutely no deal

71
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,890
struck here no danger so why did he ever

72
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,239
need to tell Jack about this encounter

73
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,850
then then tell no tales roll frigates

74
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,040
movie reminds you of which movie this is

75
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,870
13 minutes in but I'll forget five

76
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,640
minutes later anyway accused of

77
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,310
practicing witchcraft before you die do

78
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,920
you have anything to confess I confess

79
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,350
that I'm not a witch that I have a woman

80
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,630
of science this is either the late 1700s

81
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,980
or the early 2020s

82
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,269
I can't figure out which he might

83
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,780
confess that while we've been talking I

84
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,819
pitched this look and there's absolutely

85
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,380
no guards will stop me after I escape

86
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,049
myself drunk bimbo ex machina also what

87
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,310
a crazy scenario where this movies come

88
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,780
up with Jack apparently had no trouble

89
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,160
getting into this safe managed to take a

90
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,989
sex partner into the safe with him and

91
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,459
they apparently drank and on the money

92
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,080
all while this crew waited until the

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,549
bank unveiled the safe the next morning

94
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:10,299
to try and steal it

95
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:14,470
do I have that right also safe sex no

96
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,510
there wasn't even if she somehow buried

97
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,130
beneath that gold she certainly would

98
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,299
have been awakened by him landing

99
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,829
directly on top of her as he rolled out

100
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,570
she appeared out of thin air maybe she's

101
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,660
the witch they're looking for they also

102
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,160
am I the only one who's rooting for the

103
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,870
British to kill Jack once and for all it

104
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,130
takes a lot to make this American root

105
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,989
for 18th century British people but five

106
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,430
movies like this will do it know also

107
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,840
because nobody likes money everyone

108
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,980
stands here and watches the bank

109
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,720
literally drift away while also not

110
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,370
killing an even easier to kill Jack

111
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,040
Sparrow is there rope just lying here on

112
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,810
the floor was being used for the heist

113
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,489
it seems only to be here to give Jack

114
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,019
yet another cheap escape from an

115
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,280
unescapable situation this would never

116
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
be the first thing he says to her or the

117
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,549
way he says it ever forced double

118
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,870
entendres are the weakest double

119
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,579
entendres also what if you looking for

120
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,290
through a telescope in the middle of the

121
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,819
day what if it was pointed to the Sun

122
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,739
careful play with your Herschel too much

123
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,239
you might go blind there's no way this

124
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,769
Bank makes this turn unless it's on a

125
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,750
track for pete's sake Fast Five was less

126
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,310
ridiculous and when you're taking physic

127
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,959
lessons from The Fast franchise is it

128
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,670
maybe time to call it a day

129
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,630
you see my mind didn't the bank just

130
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,290
come through here

131
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,000
it left Jeff behind a minute ago so why

132
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,080
would it be coming anywhere near him

133
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,430
normally this type of thing would break

134
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,290
this encounter but it seemed worse this

135
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,700
thing's been through five transformers

136
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,470
17 fast and furious is four and a

137
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,880
quarter of these movies and travel

138
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,470
through time so this ain't no thing

139
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,590
black pill is never left me son honestly

140
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,730
I don't know which is more ridiculous

141
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,990
but the movie thinks I remember why this

142
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,580
ship is in his pocket or that it thinks

143
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,270
I even care

144
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,060
the pirate barbers old these seas now I

145
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,620
sure I'm glad you clarified that it's

146
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,240
the pirate Barbosa because I would have

147
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,830
thought you met Fred Barbosa the tuna

148
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,710
King facing Jack bad-luck dogs you day

149
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,160
and night

150
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,690
Gibbs clearly hasn't seen the other four

151
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,010
movies or at least the last ten minutes

152
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,750
of this one

153
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,730
watch it seagull that's our job my

154
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,620
father is trapped by such a curse your

155
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,210
weather causes I'm not supported by

156
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,270
science neither ghosts so you have gone

157
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,620
mad but you came here to talk to this

158
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,330
guy about the Trident but you do believe

159
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,010
in but you don't believe in ghosts or

160
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,370
curses

161
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,850
so Poseidon possible curses not got it

162
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,530
but this meth has never been seen nor it

163
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,190
by any man okay oh so the map is

164
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,410
cock-blocked then make sense is the

165
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,380
diary of Galileo Galilei he spent his

166
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,360
life searching for the Trident Galileo

167
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,040
was a pretty smart dude and we find out

168
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,390
later that basically we just have to

169
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,590
follow some stars to find it

170
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,000
you mean with all the information he had

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,559
he couldn't do that give me the bottle

172
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,149
shouldn't the bartender have to accept

173
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,409
this trade before any of this reverse

174
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,759
the curse nonsense actually starts to

175
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,649
happen for some reason Sauron dies again

176
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,299
in this movie also if my memory serves

177
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,679
it's not like this is the first time

178
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,879
jack has given this thing to someone

179
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,379
else why didn't that set things in

180
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,149
motion why is this bartender so eager to

181
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,589
grab the compass does he know what it is

182
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,269
is it an earthquake coz if I think

183
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:57,649
something you're trying to give me is

184
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,969
causing an earthquake I'm sending you

185
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,929
the hell away from my bar has given away

186
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,849
the compass Oh what they're free from is

187
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,409
anyone's guess I suppose it could mean

188
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:10,939
constant darkness but everyone on this

189
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,259
boat is still cursed and dead looking

190
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,539
and can't touch land so are they free

191
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,739
from luckily for the plot of this movie

192
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,539
Kareena was put into a Cell complete

193
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,829
with the moon roof so that she could

194
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,179
read the map that you can only read

195
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,509
under a Blood Moon can we talk about how

196
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,429
sparrow set this up later we see he used

197
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:27,139
some sort of hay to create the shape but

198
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,879
but that he bind it with stand it up

199
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,469
with how does it balance impossible

200
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:35,839
scare Sparrow is impossible gross

201
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,309
you do still want us to kind of actually

202
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:40,039
like Jack Sparrow right moving oh and

203
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,569
you could be the one who holds the scene

204
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,149
would it become all that you once were

205
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,309
great I believe this is exactly how

206
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,569
Johnny Depp approaches this character

207
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:49,249
now he calls it method sleeping the

208
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:52,189
child can never be found funny after

209
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,929
four movies Barbosa still think stuff

210
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,519
like finding the Trident is impossible

211
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,989
but all the other mind-blowing bullshit

212
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:58,579
in these movies well as possible the

213
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,159
data containing the cer able to step on

214
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:01,750
dry

215
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,180
but why they told us Davy Jones could

216
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,650
only step on dry land every ten years

217
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,180
and that was a rule specific to the

218
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,860
Flying Dutchman but apparently no dead

219
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,420
men at sea could touch dry land

220
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,980
arbitrary curse rules continue to be

221
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,370
arbitrary my ways that screenwriter

222
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,590
speak for we have no clue we'd also if

223
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,090
this woman is an honest-to-god witch why

224
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,590
isn't she dead they were ready to kill

225
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,030
not a witch Karina almost immediately

226
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,790
time to make a deal with the dead this

227
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,260
witch told him that the cost of entering

228
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,940
this room would be blood but she just

229
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,080
gives the compass to him without any

230
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,430
payment because something something in

231
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,240
the past Jackie boy I can't believe they

232
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,950
got Pete best to play jacks uncle why

233
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,540
are these guards even allowing this we

234
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,100
strip away all human rights and decency

235
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,450
here but hey if you need to have a

236
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,770
conversation with another inmate while

237
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,180
we are dragging you somewhere by all

238
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,110
means go ahead the biggest proof that

239
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,550
she may actually be a witch is that this

240
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,440
works most of you have the mind of a guy

241
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,540
I hate to bring up stuff like this in a

242
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,890
movie filled with pirates which is

243
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,050
zombies curses and trident but what this

244
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,880
town square really have dual executions

245
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,590
going on with one hanging and another a

246
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,460
beheading is this if you could just be

247
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,660
patient Oh

248
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,940
this goes on for some time and none of

249
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,500
the kill happy Brits decides to kill

250
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,150
someone and end this stupid scene and

251
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,480
movie

252
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,710
I guess Henry knew there would be some

253
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,210
sort of delay in killing Karina and Jack

254
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,560
girls this rescue attempt would have

255
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,919
been super late this random spectator

256
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,050
would be amazing at cinemasins no son

257
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,910
I'm just a diversion divergent avulsion

258
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,680
kill Oh tease you have a sword she's

259
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,210
being hung with a rope swords can cut

260
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,440
ropes jeez do I really have to spell

261
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,000
this out for you also pretty sure that

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,229
rope is long enough that Little Miss

263
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,669
can't be wrong could just step off that

264
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,409
trapdoor you know if she was really

265
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,849
worried about dying and stuff she can be

266
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,500
caught here with that much slack still

267
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,880
in the rope this hanging was never going

268
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,410
to work unless the goal was simply to

269
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,440
break her ankles when she hit the ground

270
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,120
save your neck then we know who Jack's

271
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,680
crew was or did he just stumble upon

272
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,270
some people who would do this job and it

273
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,290
just happened to be Jack's old crew

274
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,240
sitting where your left hand is I said

275
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
well not if you're holding everything

276
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,839
but my West how exactly did he catch her

277
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,100
if his hand is inappropriately placed

278
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,690
did he go to the Weinstein school of

279
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,490
catching things then I bestow upon you

280
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,200
the owner citing name for a small

281
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,820
donation you expect us to be

282
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,870
apparently yes that's what the movie is

283
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,550
saying and there is no explanation for

284
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,040
why this works how much of this idiot

285
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,480
are we supposed to put up with did

286
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,240
someone take a poll yeah look at this if

287
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,670
I kill the coward the witch hags

288
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,160
then do it already you really think we

289
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,930
can find the Trident seriously these

290
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,160
people came back to work for Jack

291
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,500
because of some mythical Trident why are

292
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,090
they tying these people up because by

293
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,350
God if you tell me that it's a fifty

294
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,640
Shades sequel called fifty shades of

295
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,700
gray beard ma Corina expects a bunch of

296
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,870
don't assholes and know what she means

297
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,640
by pointing to the sky okay sure they

298
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,020
didn't throw him in the seat but surely

299
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,910
if he landed like that he's at least got

300
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,350
a concussion and might be on his way to

301
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,640
bleeding out also pretty sure a

302
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
full-sized human being landing from

303
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,790
fifteen feet into a wooden boat would

304
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,200
make enough noise to give away the ruse

305
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
I went - no way that pirate is going

306
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,100
with that witch Jesus

307
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,480
Kareena wrote all the directions on her

308
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,550
prison wall that's amazing so we've both

309
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,840
spent our lives searching for our

310
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,730
fathers well know we've seen your dad

311
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,110
and you know where he is you even

312
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,700
stupidly nearly drowned yourself to see

313
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,290
him but I kind of admire that you're

314
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,970
looking for any reason to find something

315
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,470
in common with this woman just because

316
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,030
you can't see something doesn't mean

317
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,190
it's not bad skip the son do something

318
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,300
I'm so uptight

319
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,830
we've seen Salazar's undead army

320
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,450
immediately kill people when he taps his

321
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,220
sword but this guy decides now I'll just

322
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,930
put my sword to his throat maybe he'll

323
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,280
talk his way out of it there's no

324
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,300
emergency there's no mercy the Creed of

325
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,860
Apple eating assholes everywhere this

326
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,510
type of bullet physics was disproven by

327
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,770
Mythbusters but I guess since

328
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,390
Mythbusters didn't exist back then those

329
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,380
bullets didn't get the message

330
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,660
scrawny debt also young Johnny Depp CGI

331
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,280
mixed with another actor basically looks

332
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,270
like what happens if he told the

333
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,590
computer what the young version would

334
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,120
look like but young Johnny Depp doesn't

335
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,890
look like this really take a look at a

336
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,090
picture from Nightmare on Elm Street or

337
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,770
21 Jump Street or even Sweeney Todd the

338
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,480
Demon Barber of Fleet Street well maybe

339
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,760
not that last one one ship was trying to

340
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
escape through this boat one that

341
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,030
despite the clear and decisive victory

342
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,710
by Salazar still had a full crew and

343
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,510
sustained no damage the magic of movies

344
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,160
you see Salazar is actually a good guy

345
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,810
in this story even though he didn't want

346
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,190
to show mercy to some filthy pirates

347
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,810
after the battle was over jack is

348
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,250
definitely the bad guy here but because

349
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,870
we supposedly love Jack the story's

350
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,220
flipped on its head so now that we have

351
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,630
this convenient backstory for Salazar

352
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,730
and young Jack how exactly did Salazar

353
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,170
know it was the compass that cursed him

354
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,910
again and furthermore how did the

355
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,550
compass cursor

356
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,620
dad Barbosa was saved at the last minute

357
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,780
by a Jack Sparrow organ story I hope I

358
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,580
was this stupid well actually the first

359
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,440
movie was pretty clever oh you mean the

360
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,150
people carry on them say you know we'll

361
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,980
be cool half dead skeleton sharks

362
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,840
chasing their heroes to shore but why

363
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
would Salazar even have sharks didn't

364
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,290
you hear me skeleton sharks what's good

365
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,010
even care

366
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,690
cinemasins cares motherfuckers

367
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,940
cinemasins cares also right to say it

368
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,560
the sharks from Finding Nemo look more

369
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,430
realistic than these do ya distract them

370
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,500
they magically home get on Jack Sparrow

371
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,390
why would clothes distract them and why

372
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,350
haven't they smashed his boat into

373
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,880
smithereens yet if they could do that

374
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,140
then why didn't they do it from the very

375
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,970
beginning I send zombie sharks

376
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,380
well unless they're also standing on

377
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,820
some sort of moisture then they're

378
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,590
totally okay the spirit world must have

379
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,300
a terrible time figuring out how much is

380
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,890
enough water and he can't stand on the

381
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,660
land scenario pool traps bro so how did

382
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,800
you set that one up on a three second

383
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,600
delay if you never escape that Islands

384
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,310
our waste time killing all the barbosa's

385
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,780
underlings and not Barbosa himself

386
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,190
they'd be so mad about Jack being on

387
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,520
land

388
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,420
wake up Spyro it's time to pay your debt

389
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,040
of course they crashed on an unknown

390
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,690
uncharted unreachable island and there

391
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,220
are pirates there who know Jack and have

392
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,930
a beef with it congratulations

393
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,320
it's your wedding day god damn it this

394
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
movie wants to be 90 minutes but like

395
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,650
the gluttony victim in seven someone

396
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,030
kept feeding it until it burst

397
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,310
II like seafood I'm surprised there

398
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,690
wasn't a real-life mutiny on this set

399
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,130
when the actors and crew were told we

400
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,270
need to spend an entire week filming

401
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,010
Jack Sparrow's fake wedding even if it

402
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,660
was just a day or a few hours it was too

403
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,570
much this brings up another question why

404
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,100
can Salazar step on a boat that just

405
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,570
happens to be on water and still be

406
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,160
considered on water if he's stepping on

407
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,550
wood

408
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,990
why didn't you get a couple glass boxes

409
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,280
filled them with seawater and use them

410
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,100
as shoes we had something sharp few were

411
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,450
the Farrelly Brothers gross toenail

412
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,190
scene we all know this fucking toenail

413
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,510
should be able to break them out of the

414
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,880
cell but man are we not entertained also

415
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,900
they'll break out of the cell and

416
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,250
quietly steal a rowboat from this

417
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,140
British ship without a pink soul knowing

418
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,470
about it

419
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,180
these bumbling pirates are quite amazing

420
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,860
off screen where did you get that

421
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,220
you see I know this book oh come on no

422
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,220
you don't you remember a book phew also

423
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,800
this is his daughter isn't it me yes we

424
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,120
get it she's his daughter

425
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,680
one more convenient confusing and

426
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,180
convoluted story point to try and

427
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,440
obscure that this plot is actually

428
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
thinner than a skeleton pirate shadow

429
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,680
sounds artist Ines to destroy the

430
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,029
British ship but my thought he hated

431
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,500
pirates not other people who hate

432
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,120
pirates why not take on the Black Pearl

433
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,279
in tandem I'm just gonna sin this but no

434
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,019
Jack probably can jump on all these wet

435
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:03,370
cannons in the rain and not slip once

436
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,140
why would I ever question that of course

437
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,940
the ship is cursed and can do crazy

438
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,890
things why is this glorified hood

439
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,120
ornament just now taking part in this

440
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,980
battle so why didn't Salazar just turn

441
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,570
his ship in a pirate pac-man like he's

442
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,010
done so many times to so many other

443
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,480
ships in this movie he clearly doesn't

444
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,279
care what kills Jack as long as he dies

445
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,149
so why go through all this trouble after

446
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,380
seeing Jack escaped so many situations

447
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,570
he finally gets rammed by a cannon with

448
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,920
the weight of an entire ship thrusting

449
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,019
it and he survives Congrats you found

450
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,610
the secret island but how exactly did

451
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,930
you survive sound was our ship for the

452
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,430
last 10 minutes this crew has killed

453
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,110
everything with ease and impunity and

454
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,459
actually cut that British ship in half

455
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,380
with a single bite what is taking them

456
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,850
so long to finish off this weak band of

457
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,990
mortals

458
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,639
the islands sure you need to get off the

459
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,619
ship can't spare a half second to spear

460
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:51,939
Sparrow through the heart before you go

461
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:56,499
please

462
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:58,329
guess the magical MacGuffin awaits it

463
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,189
better have a 42 printed on it somewhere

464
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,689
because that thing is apparently the

465
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,399
answer to life the expanded universe and

466
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,350
everything so the Ruby she's using here

467
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,029
was on Galileo's diary but where did

468
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:07,869
Galileo get it

469
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:09,399
decidin was the one who made the map

470
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,259
that no man can read so that means he

471
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,610
would have broken off this piece of Ruby

472
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,410
himself and then what he gave to

473
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,149
somebody he chucked it into the sea and

474
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,009
somehow someone found that Ruby and

475
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,480
thought to himself who knows Ruby I bet

476
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,619
it's the key to finding Poseidon's

477
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,209
trident I will dedicate my life to it

478
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,860
besides island is addictive people who

479
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,509
figured out his stupid map once you

480
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,949
possess the Leaving there's no coming

481
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,899
back you will be dropped in his body

482
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,269
forever wait so they can go on land if

483
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,309
they possess someone setting aside that

484
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,600
it's yet another new rule that we are

485
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,949
just now hearing about how do they even

486
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,689
know these rules does every curse come

487
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,129
with a handbook welcome be your curse

488
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,480
here are a few things you need to know

489
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,769
before you get started what is it this

490
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:42,910
year with movies where the protagonist

491
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,740
go through all this to find an artifact

492
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,449
only to have to go through more after

493
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,189
they've done all the hard stuff this and

494
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,329
transform is found at the same movie

495
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,810
basically

496
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,970
what does the Trident even do so he was

497
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,709
able to unpossessed Henry's body which

498
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,000
we were told was impossible without the

499
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,709
Trident but his skin condition hadn't

500
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,330
cleared up one bit so in its current

501
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,550
state it can take care of one curse but

502
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:11,430
not others Salazar's fingertips this

503
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,440
still doesn't kill jack what did she

504
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,850
just do there it looked like she was

505
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,040
reaching into the water but why did she

506
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,540
give the oncoming curse pirates I

507
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,130
haven't said no was she busting their

508
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,810
barnacles does anybody understand

509
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,310
anything about what's going on here this

510
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,690
movie isn't even trying to keep it a

511
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,170
secret that it's one big flushing toilet

512
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,180
and every curse is held inside what how

513
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,920
do you make that leap of logic the idea

514
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,329
that this trident could break curses was

515
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,399
one thing but that it stores curses the

516
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,990
Trident an incredible artefact of power

517
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,790
wielded by a sea God cannot penetrate

518
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,190
the defenses of Galileo's diary divide

519
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,510
I've never seen such nonsense get

520
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,950
figured out this quickly also now that

521
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,120
they're going to break the trident to

522
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,769
break the curse how do curses get broken

523
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:57,600
from here on out or curse is eliminated

524
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,079
forever so the water is now an issue for

525
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,399
you but the half a head thing that's

526
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,079
still cool why is the water returning so

527
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
slowly is there some sort of gradual

528
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,380
gravity field release why wouldn't it

529
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,030
just release immediately this tattoo is

530
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,439
so ridiculous it might as well have said

531
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,030
for Kareena the daughter I gave away to

532
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,439
an orphanage and it would have been no

533
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,179
worse I mean this special map that no

534
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,860
man can read is tattooed on his body for

535
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,660
a lame parentage reveal why not just

536
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,040
have Maury Povich drop into the middle

537
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,000
of the sea and reveal it

538
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,410
how is Barbosa this far above them

539
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,329
didn't he knock them off the chain hope

540
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,770
he doesn't know how to gravity you will

541
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,630
right Oh totally just another one of

542
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,160
those find out you have a father in the

543
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,450
same moment he's sacrificing his life

544
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,750
for you days you what did you do that

545
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,140
for

546
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,660
just checking it's truly you know sort

547
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,880
of ghost run Henry as fast and as far

548
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
away from her as your sea legs will take

549
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,020
you run now after breaking the Trident

550
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,640
wheels curse was lifted and this movie

551
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,200
didn't even show it on screen a big

552
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,910
moment for a legacy character in fact

553
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,500
why isn't he already back on land the

554
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,910
curse was lifted in what you still had

555
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,740
to do more work let me tell you a tale a

556
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,059
tale of the greatest treasures and

557
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,880
learns in that that's its hello I just

558
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,740
watched it no you don't Elizabeth didn't

559
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,910
tag along with Henry to greet will

560
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,260
because she knew her surprise cameo

561
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,820
would delight the five people still left

562
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,910
in the theater

563
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,430
Jack Sparrow on deck seriously what's

564
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,230
changed he didn't get one red cent on

565
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,250
your Poseidon Adventure

566
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,690
you left Jack because of the lack of

567
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,160
money nothing's different

568
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,810
but yeah I'll he'll Jack Sparrow just in

569
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,280
case you forgot that you just watched a

570
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
fifth movie squeezed out of a 16 minute

571
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,300
amusement park ride post-credits it was

572
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
a dream but was it nonsense completely

573
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,050
undermines entire film by revealing that

574
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,120
claw handed tentacle face guy is still

575
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,980
somehow cursed and also not dead and

576
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,660
also who the hell even cares anymore

577
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,260
