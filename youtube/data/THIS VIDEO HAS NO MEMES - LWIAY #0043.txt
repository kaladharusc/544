1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,220
I did an- OOOPPSIE *with a hmM filter*

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,560
(some music, beware headphone users)

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,620
Ladies and gentlemen

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,540
We got them

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,040
(bunch of pewdiepie and demi lovato drama articles with a pinch of earrape)

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,120
Well I guess it's another meme I killed

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,240
Is it a good defense that it was a deep fried meme?

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,480
Don't make it worse Felix, don't make it worse.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,680
Moving on! Today is today where it's all going down ;-;

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,100
Luckily I'm able to shoot this before the Pewdiepie subreddit, I know it's gonna happen to it okay

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,640
It's not good, so I'm shooting this now

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Just to get out of-- out of the way

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,380
I know we said no more unoriginal content

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,300
But it's now or never and I'm taking the opportunity

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
*in voice only poods can do*: I don't understand what he's talking about 
Keep it that way, OK.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,260
Moving on
*Claps*

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,020
What is this? (ligma stone)

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,880
Wait, what is this?

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,660
&quot;In support of the no meme revolution I encourage you all to just post the pictures of your pet&quot;

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,440
DAMN IT !!!

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
You think you can outsmart me?

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,380
I'm not even wearing any headphones right now !

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,660
What're you gonna do???

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,760
My audience think they're better than me!

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,240
They think &quot;Oh if we don't post any memes under pewdiepie subreddit

26
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,500
then he'll have to create his own content&quot;

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,860
But the memes about not posting memes are in fact memes ! (mindblown)

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,580
Uh, that's right everybody !

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,700
I'm lvl 5000 wokeness ! Epic Style ! Like a Bomb ! *distorted pewdiepie is visible to our eyesight*

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,740
Moving on to another great meme, here we go we started off strong

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,680
Jesus Christ !
*family friendly pure swistian felix activated*

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,200
Is that a monster?  (fetus felix over there)

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,220
I was booming even when I was

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,060
17? 16? *Burp*

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,400
I literally wore some girl's glasses so we can make out

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,780
Oopsie

37
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,980
Hmmmmm

38
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,660
Man I wish there were more bodyguards there, it would've been so beautiful

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,260
Hehe

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,440
Missed opportunity ! Meme correction ! Do it right and do it again !

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,420
&quot;There are no memes here, Please play Lego Star Wars&quot;

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,840
Good ol' Lego Star Wars
&quot;F (family friendly) that Detroit game&quot;

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,800
&quot;It better be Lego Star Wars on the Nintendo DS&quot;

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,900
Oh Wow ! It's a thing. Be careful what you wish for!

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,500
&quot;Meme locked due to lack of original co-&quot;
Come on guys, I need it please.I'm dying here !

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,440
Alright I need to move past this whole media thing

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,360
Please gimme memes, I beg you !

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,520
I actually thought this was real for a second

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
&quot;It worked&quot;

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
&quot;My fans forced me to do it&quot;

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,860
Well 
See there you go, It worked !
Now please post a meme.

52
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,320
&quot;Hey Felix, today was my teacher's last day of working in my school and he is an amazing teacher.
At the end of the lesson we did a debate on what's better memes or GIFs.&quot;

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
JIFs

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,220
&quot;Memes obviously and he clapped his hands and shouted MEME REVIEW !
And he looked at me and then said

55
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,840
But can you do this !

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Well end of story and can you say hi? His name Joshua Hill, because apparently he's watching this&quot;

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,060
Can we post this in the &quot;This totally happened subreddit&quot; ?

58
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,880
This definitely happened

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,360
Hi Joshua!

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,020
*Claps*
Meme Review

61
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,320
Thanks for teaching the 9 year olds of the world

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
*Snicker*

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,420
As a 9 yr old that's quite impressive

64
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,240
&quot;Only people who are not Pewdiepie can see thisssssss&quot;

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,040
DAMN

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,720
STOP IT!
This is bullying!
This is cybernetic bullying (call bully hunters)

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,360
I will not stand for treating people badly online
*Then sit down pewds, you have a $399 chair*

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
That is one of the worst things you could possibly do...

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,420
And I don't understand-- Do you understand how people feel bad 
You can't - *snickers*

70
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,400
''When the video isn't 10 mins long yet&quot;

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,220
*some chef music in the bg* Check out ASS everybody!

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,940
It's out on every single console ever
*Liar Pewds, It's not out for SteamOs (Linux) and macOS*
I think you guys will enjoy

73
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,020
''Oh my god, is this Loss?''

74
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,440
I saw this one

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,020
Oh my god

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,680
Oh my god, That's beautiful !

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,700
You know what? Loss lives on.
How about that !

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,280
This gets 5000 upvotes

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,660
''No meme here pewds''

80
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,520
Oh! Come on !

81
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,140
Come on !

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,420
Why do you hate me?

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,540
What have I done?
Have I not gotten enough abuse?

84
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,060
Can I not get some love?

85
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,540
Daddy wants some love from 9 yr- No wait !
*Pewds realises he's being pedo*

86
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,500
Just stop it ok?
Just stop the cyber bullying ;_;

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,440
I've had enough!

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,680
''For mama?''

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,320
''For papa?''

90
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,540
''For Marzia to host LWIAY?''

91
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,980
I thought he was sucking on her--
You know what, let's just move on.

92
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,200
&quot;No meme, just me and some ducks&quot;

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,820
''Those are some hairy legs for a 9 yr old''

94
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,000
Maybe the duck is the 9 yr old?

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,380
&quot;Marzia not having any memes to look at, 9 yr olds,

96
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,720
Only posting pictures of Marzia until she hosts LWIAY&quot;

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,620
Here it is again. You just wanna (chuckles) get rid of me.

98
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,280
&quot;Instead of Marzia can we had jacksfilms hosts LWIAY?&quot;

99
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,740
Uh, he does it every single day, okay?
And I've had enough

100
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,980
&quot;If we make Marzia meme, PewDiePie can't make meme review anymore because he don't want to kill his fiance&quot;

101
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,440
Don't test me, buddy.
I me- (chuckles)

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,080
&quot;If this is successful, we will have infinite original content&quot;

103
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,080
You know what? You know what, I would be mad, but I'm also proud for the deeper level thinking.

104
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,680
This is what I'm trying to accomplish in this channel. 
For 9 yr olds to think a little more higher.

105
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,420
Th-The extra step, the extra mile

106
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,420
I'm crying right now, because I'm in fear.

107
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,120
*pffft*

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,700
&quot;I really do believe that Pewds is underrated, despite being the most popular YouTuber. He's one of the most genuine people on this platform.

109
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,080
It's really underappreciated that he's stayed humble and true to himself after 8 years of making videos&quot;

110
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,540
I feel like this is a very nice comment, but I feel like you're not up to speed with what's going on out there, okay?

111
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,760
I'm a horrible memer. I post deep fried memes, like a boss. Not like a boss

112
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,660
Okay, I don't deserve this compliment. Please.

113
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,840
Take it away. Give it to someone else that's more worth it.

114
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,220
&quot;Just saw this and had to--&quot; I've seen this before!

115
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,740
Honestly, one of the reason I wanted to play beyond (its detroit bh poods '_&gt;') , was just to get the memes

116
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,080
And I still don't get them.

117
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,340
*help mee* *ded inside*

118
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,060
&quot;Let Marzia host LWIAY&quot;

119
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Ok, fine. 500k likes, Marzia, will host the next, LWIAY. And that's a promise.

120
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,300
But then, you have to keep posting memes. 
*spits hand* Deal?

121
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,740
*spits moar pew juice* Deal?
I know you're just being ridiculous

122
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,400
&quot;Since memes get downvoted *starts to laugh*, here's the view from my hike today&quot;

123
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Wow. What a great view, everyone. *clap*

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,360
*clappity clap*

125
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,020
Smash like. Who needs memes? *clap* This is great. *clap* This is phenomenal

126
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,440
Is there a LOSS in here somewhere? *laughs*

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,020
&quot;If Marzia is subscribed to Pewds, then doesn't it make Pewds engaged to a 9--&quot; NO!

128
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,340
(feat Jordan) Stop it. Get some help.

129
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
&quot;No meme--&quot; God dammit

130
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,120
Please, puhlease. I need this video to get to 10 minutes. Somehow.

131
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,420
Ple-- Aw, my eyes, Jesus Christ!

132
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,760
&quot;This Felix guy should make a YouTube channel. He's really funny&quot;

133
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,560
This comment gets reposted on every, single, Marzia video that I'm in.

134
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,060
You're telling ME, THAT I don't post original content?
Oh, we're equally bad here

135
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,280
Let's face it. We're both scum. We're both the lowest degenerates of the earth.

136
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,600
Posting PewDiePie memes, like, what are we doing here? *chuckles*

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,120
Is there not anything better that we could be doing?

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,060
&quot;Brad host LWIAY and Pewds edit it&quot;?
Uh, no *laughs*

139
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:15,760
&quot;Are we posting pets here now? This good boi is 63 in dog years&quot;
I've seen this photo before. Are you guys reposting?

140
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Hey look, Edgar, you've finally have a friend. How about that? (edgar :no u)

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,560
&quot;How can Marzia hosts LWIAY if there are no memes on the subreddit?&quot; (hmmMMm)

142
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,900
Well, since Marzia's going to review it next week, why don't we just, make it a Marzia related meme?

143
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:38,460
*Marzia edition LWIAY intro song*

144
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,340
*claps* That's nice. Alright, we'll have that as intro next week. Thank you, poserroser. Very cool

145
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,820
&quot;Marzia will be hosting LWIAY in the next episode&quot; 
This is a faker-diker!

146
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,880
But it's also true, so it's okay

147
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,500
&quot;Nothing stands in the way of the 9 year old army&quot;

148
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,100
&quot;Skylol on lwiay:check

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,360
Detroit gameplay: check&quot;

150
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,340
I guess, you know, I've completely overrun by my audience here.

151
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,100
This is not even my channel anymore,

152
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,520
they don't even want me here, so I don't  even want me really know what I'm doing here.

153
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,600
&quot;Since everyone agreed to not post any memes, I'm gonna post this cute cat&quot;
Great, thank you.

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,440
&quot;#throwback, I went to the bathroom and almost had a heart attack, Felix&quot;

155
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,420
&quot;I see you met Jerry..&quot;
Hey, an army of Jerries, everybody. It's happening.

156
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,200
Hey, that's really cool. It's not a meme, but, you know, I'll take it. Thank you very much, finger_year

157
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Finger y--

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
&quot;What if everyone just posted pictures of--&quot; My God, STAHP!

159
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,060
I had a rough day, okay? Please?

160
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
&quot;Having Marzia host LWIAY&quot;

161
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,060
&quot;Having Dr. Phil host LWIAY&quot; Yes, of course. This is only the natural progression

162
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,700
Dr. Phil, if you're watching, it would be my honor.

163
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
&quot;I want Pewds to explain this&quot;

164
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,480
Well, you see, this is the 1st episode of 'Scare PewDiePie, Season 2', and this is the reason why it actually never got released

165
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:11,560
&quot;I found boar vessel, 600-500 BC, Etruscan, Ceramic in a museum today. I was so excited until i remember Felix already reviewed this meme

166
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,400
Now I'm eternally stuck posing beside a dead meme&quot; 
Where is it? Where IS IT?

167
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,080
Why didn't you steal it, and give it to me?

168
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,560
&quot;You don't look 9&quot;
It must be her mom

169
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,420
I want it! Alright, dead meme or not--

170
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:25,920
I WANT IT!

171
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,920
&quot;From the 27/07, we must upload memes only in Italian so pewds will need Marzia help to translate them.&quot;

172
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,800
God dammit. Why do you do this? Why do you hate me so much?

173
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,540
Welp, clearly, it's time for me to end it.

174
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm clearly just the equivalent of a Facebook meme page

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,940
So, you know what?

176
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
Fine

177
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,560
You win, 9 yr olds, but don't come crying to me.

178
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,980
*clap* *clap*

179
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
*some naruto magic*

180
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,400
*POOF*

181
00:09:57,400 --> 00:11:08,240
(1 minute+ gameplay of ASS to make it 11 minutes cause 10 minutes is getting overused)

182
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,220
(hurray chicken won!)

183
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,000
