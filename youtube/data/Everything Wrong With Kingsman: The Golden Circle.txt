[Music]

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,110
this head impact is well above anywhere

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,369
that would start playing this music

4
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,600
unless this is the way it's designed to

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
be started which seems unnecessarily

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,600
painful you had at least five seconds

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,740
while this dude's metal hand was

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,390
sparking on the asphalt to get this gun

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,740
and start doing some damage while were

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,939
you waiting for that Charlie has a

11
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,409
robotic arm that this kind of strength

12
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,659
why was this ever even if I harbor

13
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:31,189
I guess drift mode is cool and all but

14
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:32,660
why did these are the three cars let it

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,800
happen I thought it might be because

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,420
they wanted him to escape because they

17
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,040
knew the Trojan arm was already in there

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,870
except later they unload a car top easy

19
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,460
on the guy simply pulling forward would

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,750
have been so much easier the Kings ban

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,160
the Furious not that they'd have much

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,720
chance against all this weaponry but are

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,920
the London cops too busy looking for

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,440
Banksy to do something about this okay

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,340
fine that's awesome

26
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,990
yeah but what if there were four guards

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,700
that Merlin and eggsy forgot about this

28
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,440
cyborg arm it's bad enough but this

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,820
thing can move on its own why didn't it

30
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,080
just strangle eggsy when it had the

31
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,220
chance that's it

32
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,449
this metal arm has everything it needs

33
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,130
to plug an open port and download all

34
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,840
the Kingsmen info ever that's the case

35
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,190
what a stupid way to go about getting it

36
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,750
all you need is the arm in the car right

37
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,160
you don't even need to wait for eggsy to

38
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,420
let you in just break the windshield

39
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,979
take out the driver and be done with it

40
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,450
no worries eggsy just leave that man

41
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,250
hole open when some poor child falls to

42
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,660
their death we will forgive you I mean

43
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,100
your fancy suit smelled bad and stuff

44
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,600
but how could you be bothered this just

45
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,530
backs up my philosophy that

46
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,120
relationships that start with anal sex

47
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,190
are for life this is what eggsy decided

48
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,450
was important enough to jump into a

49
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,340
sewer to attend like what made sense if

50
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,180
it was he and his girlfriend's

51
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,890
anniversary or something but birthday

52
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,650
party last time yeah I was rectum that's

53
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,590
because you're a lightweight sorry to

54
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,509
mellow this bro of love but that wasn't

55
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,979
really not funny I haven't seen someone

56
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,690
overreact this much since Jamie Foxx

57
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,250
turned electric blue because spider-man

58
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,860
forgot his name parents for the first

59
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,630
time tomorrow no tomorrow night would

60
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,130
have been a much better reason to jump

61
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,810
into the sewer than this one also why

62
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,890
are you worried about drinking tonight

63
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,149
when you're visiting her parents

64
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,069
tomorrow night while I enjoy the super

65
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,539
over-the-top villains lair I've got to

66
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,950
wonder how do you build a place like

67
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,210
this without it ever showing up in a

68
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,860
satellite photo I just think it's really

69
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,810
important for new recruits to understand

70
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,440
the history of the Golden Circle roll

71
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:19,970
joints okay okay fine

72
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,680
movie admits reasons because it wants to

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,390
do some meat grinder but even so

74
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,709
how does this work the guy who brought

75
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,030
in the new recruit is untrustworthy

76
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,709
enough to kill but the guy he brought it

77
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,120
into somehow okay seems like that should

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
be fruit of the poison tree or patty of

79
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,140
the poisoned beef or something no people

80
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,459
who are running away in a panic don't

81
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,930
stop and do a slow burn to see what

82
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,340
might be coming after them scared people

83
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,930
like my nostrils after eating Nashville

84
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,790
hot chicken they never stop running not

85
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,080
that I'm complaining because honestly

86
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,880
this bestie burger is already a bit

87
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,830
gross for my taste but if a live human

88
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,510
went into this mincer it would not only

89
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,980
be kicking out meat be kicking out

90
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,959
clothes and hair and look I still don't

91
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,370
know how these Holograms are sitting in

92
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,690
the correct places at the table they are

93
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,340
not physically out but as we've seen

94
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,870
time again these movies are dicks when

95
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,010
it comes to explaining hologram

96
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,530
societies we saved the world and wasn't

97
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,060
the world completely change by most of

98
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,140
the wealthy elite getting their heads

99
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,610
blown off and all of those million

100
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,080
people who died did the world snap back

101
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,940
to its original self in a year when you

102
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,280
electrocuted him you damaged his implant

103
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,770
instead of his head exploding he only

104
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,570
lost an arm and his vocal cords somehow

105
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,070
this one-armed man was able to escape

106
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,690
valentine's secret lair in the mountains

107
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,550
after everyone had left and weren't all

108
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,230
planes and some underground bunker that

109
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,000
would be impossible to fly planes out of

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,230
without codes and air-traffic

111
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,420
controllers also Wow good thing all the

112
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,160
major armed arteries are in the left arm

113
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,570
or old Charlie borer here might have

114
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,340
bled out cannabis Queen casually coerced

115
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,020
his coworker cannibalism and the

116
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,880
Bluetooth logo is his initials really

117
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,230
you pulled up an animation of the

118
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,760
initials coming together to form a logo

119
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
and left up previous windows and times

120
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,480
with information you use several courses

121
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,070
ago what a little tab mate let's kill

122
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,330
you sure you need fingerprint

123
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,980
authentication to even open a car door

124
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,959
but this menagerie of death opens with a

125
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,630
random swipe Thanks oh come on you mean

126
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,280
he can just put on these spy glasses and

127
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,660
suddenly get tapped into X's feed

128
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,430
without a password or retinal scan or

129
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,140
other Kingsman knowing about it

130
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,730
what are we supposed to think eggsy

131
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,590
Sawyer certainly that level of firepower

132
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,060
just completely shut down the feet which

133
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,770
likely means he just saw the screen go

134
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,000
dark and really shouldn't be all that

135
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,650
concerned also this is a point that

136
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,060
movie tries to have both ways when just

137
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,560
a few seconds later these guys are none

138
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,940
the wiser as each of them is taken out

139
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,530
if your missile warning system goes off

140
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,180
a split-second before you explode you

141
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,050
went with the wrong missile warning

142
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,550
system company considering this bowling

143
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,930
alley is high tech enough to have

144
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,430
automated scoring why are these pins

145
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,230
just sitting here not being reset is she

146
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,460
waiting for Elton John to reset them

147
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,130
we're buzzed spins slide turn are we

148
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,940
impressed yet points for strength but

149
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,230
shouldn't they be a tad bit concerned

150
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,180
about accuracy I'm only alive because my

151
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,800
address wasn't on the theater base with

152
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,690
the agents and why are the addresses of

153
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,310
the agents on that database anyway even

154
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,720
if secret organizations do store

155
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,070
addresses this way would they make those

156
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,720
accessible from a computer inside a taxi

157
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,800
that sounds like something you'd have to

158
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,390
mission impossible to get also this

159
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,830
means poppy decided to coordinate an

160
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,540
attack on all these agents houses and

161
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,980
basically hoped they'd all be hung

162
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,900
luckily nearly all in work and too bad

163
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,190
she didn't have a disgruntled statesman

164
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,360
in her corner because she didn't know

165
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,410
about a whole other secret

166
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,730
crime-fighting group that could stop her

167
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,430
well from Kingsman I'd like to buy some

168
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,980
wine and he's tasting room number three

169
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,930
please so everything was on that

170
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,310
database except the King's man's

171
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,470
Doomsday Protocol location I mean sure

172
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,669
you don't want to put anything sensitive

173
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:17,990
on the database that the bad guys might

174
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,550
use against you so good call there

175
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,300
remember this forget I did quick

176
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,500
treating the audience like they are uber

177
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,180
fans of the first movie so too much to

178
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,470
ask for a sequel that can be enjoyed on

179
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,180
its own what's with hiding this clue it

180
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,890
was in a safe behind a magic pendant

181
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,510
opening door just leave a note with a

182
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,040
phone number ten times out of ten if

183
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,210
someone is drunk enough whiskey to see

184
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,620
this they would be too drunk to find it

185
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,790
or even comprehend what they are looking

186
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,560
at in case you confused it with Kentucky

187
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,140
I rang is this a standard-issue spy

188
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,880
watch that both agencies use even though

189
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,990
they are not even aware of each other

190
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,340
how the hell do they know how to use it

191
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,880
then you mean tequila was going to kill

192
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,169
Harry before they figured how their

193
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,550
story was true and even if he wasn't

194
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,690
gonna do it why would cap when we walk

195
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,250
in and yell stop like she was saving his

196
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,930
life yes you remember the place where

197
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,340
Harry was killed in the last movie it

198
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,930
was Kentucky of course the place where a

199
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,550
secret American spy outfit exactly like

200
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,260
the Kingsmen just so happens to be oh so

201
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,789
this is some next-level Kentucky Bulls

202
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,680
about to happen here first I'm getting a

203
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,720
crazy spike of extreme low-frequency

204
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,550
waves extreme low-frequency waves what

205
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,570
does that even mean why are you

206
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,770
monitoring for them and why is their

207
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,180
presence an emergency that demands an

208
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,160
immediate escort second your helicopters

209
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,400
tap

210
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,810
the land immediately after Valentine

211
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,310
walks away and they don't even see you

212
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,770
and finally we developed our alpha gel

213
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,020
technology for our own agents in the

214
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,360
event of a head shot the gel protects

215
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,949
the brain protect the brain you mean

216
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,150
what's left of the brain right the

217
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,990
problem isn't that the brain needs

218
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,550
protecting the problem is that the brain

219
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,900
is currently located outside of its

220
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,000
original container we use men nights

221
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,090
microbots to repair tissue damage and it

222
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,860
repairs tissue damage how does it

223
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,789
contain prometheus

224
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,410
this is simply the cure for death itself

225
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,940
right why isn't someone in this movie

226
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,050
made a trillion dollars selling this

227
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,360
technology and that will have no

228
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,530
consequences whatsoever

229
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,970
can't he just be on time what does it

230
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,470
fucking matter stop with your late

231
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,330
bullshit in movies assholes until you

232
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,900
get rid of the perimeter landmines okey

233
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,250
wearing a suit thank you very much

234
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,690
how exactly was that best supposed to

235
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,160
protect him from a landmine was he

236
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,139
crawling another wide view and flyover

237
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,430
of the compound this movie could have

238
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,020
been under two hours if it cut back on

239
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,520
the grandiose landscape porn if I wanted

240
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,750
to fly over the countryside I'd go to

241
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,510
Disney and ride Sora oh Jesus Christ

242
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,860
this movie is starting to feel like a

243
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,870
Bob Hope Christmas special also Jeff

244
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,520
Bridges if you count Sir Elton that's

245
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,380
five Oscar winners in this movie as I

246
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,820
learned watching Sesame Street sometimes

247
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,199
the best place to find Oscars is

248
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,180
slumming in the trash also also a place

249
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,620
that holds whiskey and high regard would

250
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,630
never use the codename champagne jog on

251
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,330
you hoser we need to recreate a shock or

252
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,789
trauma from his past to trigger his

253
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,530
memory what you mean you don't have a

254
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,300
special gel or microchip or Criterion

255
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,979
Collection DVD of the King's Speech that

256
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,419
will help trigger his memory we got to

257
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,650
waste time with this movie that's nearly

258
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,270
two and a half hours and yeah we'd send

259
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,590
the fact that something so easy would

260
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,090
fix his memory but we'd be nice about it

261
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,159
these art supplies are unmoved as am i

262
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,620
well if you save the world you know what

263
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,190
that means

264
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,870
man X I should really look into getting

265
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,699
an anal sex rewards cart with enough

266
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,710
points he could get a free popcorn you

267
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,449
know girl go everything was supposed to

268
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,490
be bigger in America goes on your finger

269
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,800
the surveillance trackers in the tip and

270
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
we had no choice but to make it look

271
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,130
like a condom for some easy jokes the

272
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,500
hand is not a Lucas membrane exit really

273
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,150
moving the only way this incredibly

274
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,919
advanced spy agency can track someone is

275
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,300
with the finger condom that has to be

276
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,949
gynecological inserted what if she's not

277
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,120
into you what if you needed to track a

278
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,650
man leave he has less defined sense of

279
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,090
decency and maturity than a Logan Paul

280
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,039
video puppy would you post you should

281
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,970
the police okay but it's really bad for

282
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,669
you that's why I keep whole bowls of

283
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,050
sugar here despite the rent that I'm

284
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,280
about to go on about it

285
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,159
get me started on tobacco and alcohol I

286
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,840
peddle that stuff you're in the fortune

287
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,969
500 wait is this movie for recreational

288
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,260
drug use or against it why is the

289
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,330
villain making so much sense do not

290
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,720
break the rules which is why I have

291
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
invested in robots because they are so

292
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,790
much more reliable and trustworthy than

293
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,860
human beings but yet I still kept human

294
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,510
employees around for some reason and

295
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,410
what's the deal with this angel

296
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,150
character anyway the movie made it seem

297
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,590
like he'd be important in some way and

298
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,820
now he's already being fed to the

299
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,010
mechanical dogs you know I'm busting for

300
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,500
a PhD you can deal with me if you want

301
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,270
this is the kind of sexy and disgusting

302
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,160
that I expect from the steel dossier not

303
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,520
over-the-top spy movies tents at

304
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,320
festivals no matter how opulent do not

305
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,730
have indoor plumbing this means she's

306
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,230
part of the Golden Circle right why does

307
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,400
she get to hang out at a music festival

308
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,050
during a time when her boss is about to

309
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,850
unleash her big plan and by the way this

310
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,260
is exactly why you don't mark your

311
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,430
henchmen with easily identifiable

312
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,070
markings first pov ever

313
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,960
so it's 849 p.m. in Sweden right now

314
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,580
which is six hours ahead of Louisville

315
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,350
but Kentucky must be going through one

316
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,640
of their trademark polar nights right

317
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,860
now because that would mean it's 249

318
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,480
p.m. there what did he find a 24-hour

319
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,400
pet store in rural Kentucky forgetting

320
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,780
the fact at the time is anyway it's

321
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,610
nearly nighttime and harry is still

322
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,110
sleeping when he brings this dog in this

323
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,940
goes on for some time you look like some

324
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,310
looking for a knife there's no sign loud

325
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,870
enough to express my irritation with

326
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,670
this bull sure we need another Harry

327
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,170
teaches an asshole a lesson and a bar

328
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,700
scene so that we can see that he's back

329
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,380
but does it have to be the most rootin

330
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,420
tootin a stereotypical redneck face

331
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,100
imaginable also this brings up another

332
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,660
point you never talk about your spine

333
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,280
and a bar especially a bar with so many

334
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,970
dickheads in it

335
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,020
this is actually a pretty clever play

336
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,400
off the scene in the original but like

337
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,750
almost everything else in this movie it

338
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,920
depends on your memory of the first

339
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,570
movie for it to even work this is a

340
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,130
90-minute movie bloated to almost two

341
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,600
and a half hours by a severe case of

342
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,040
sequelitis swelling Manas maketh man let

343
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,690
me translate that for you thank God

344
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,060
native Kentuckian Pedro Pascal saves the

345
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,740
day for the southern stereotypes in this

346
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,130
movie

347
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,200
oh wait as cool is a retractable whip

348
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,060
might seem exactly what vortex is that

349
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,090
whip disappearing into like most

350
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,980
megalomaniacal villains poppy somehow

351
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,510
has control over the American airwaves

352
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,670
to override every channel Joker style to

353
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,710
deliver this message some of you are

354
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,620
already infected this is exactly like

355
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,360
the Tim Burton Joker plan just switch

356
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,770
cosmetics with drugs and it's the same

357
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,500
thing breathing becomes impossible

358
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,630
luckily poppy had this perfectly timed

359
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,840
to the second to prove her point

360
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,480
I guess that's funny because it's Elton

361
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,220
John saying it well the shocker bruce

362
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,600
greenwood is playing the president again

363
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,310
my guess is that this is either leftover

364
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,230
footage from 13 days or from national

365
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,240
treasure 2 easiest paycheck ever Fox

366
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,860
News isn't comparing poppy Adams to

367
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,450
Hillary Clinton in this scene step up

368
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,310
five three four madness what I'm

369
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,670
proposing is we appear to agree to her

370
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,360
demands to prevent global panic and then

371
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,790
let the junkie scum go down in flames

372
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,490
good god what a psychopath I know that's

373
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,020
the point it's a cartoon president

374
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,520
making a cartoon decision but even a

375
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,780
psychopathic president would know that

376
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,100
letting all these people die wouldn't

377
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,080
end the war on drugs still absolutely no

378
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,220
one brings up this point in the movie

379
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,170
and that's a shame we're not talking

380
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,150
about a handful of hostages we could be

381
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,890
looking at the deaths of hundreds of

382
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,020
millions worldwide you know like a year

383
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,430
ago and that same thing happened and

384
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,330
everybody forgot about it

385
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,400
who are you I'm here to collect this

386
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
antidote was this how the lab was going

387
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,340
to give representatives of their

388
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,750
countries the antidote that this works

389
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,070
for even the briefest moment is worthy

390
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,480
of a sin and the fact that poppy has

391
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,710
drones that are going to deliver the

392
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,190
antidote anyway is worthy of another

393
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,840
yes Harry's butterfly effect distracts

394
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,880
him but did he lose total awareness why

395
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,410
isn't he answering them though how are

396
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,840
you why did they even need Harry on this

397
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,250
mission and why do they need him to do

398
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,050
this when Halle Berry can close the labs

399
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,060
cooking doors remotely so he gains full

400
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,470
control of the lift and instead of just

401
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,150
bringing them back up to the top he just

402
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,360
spins them really fast

403
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,070
why it's magic lasso has an electric

404
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,450
slicing setting apparently what else

405
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,130
gonna do if aquaman sits on it will he

406
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,240
admit that he's afraid to dying

407
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,340
also what exactly is the plan here to

408
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,870
cut a hole that somehow lets the whip

409
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,610
out enough to reach all the way up and

410
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,990
cut the tension lines so that the

411
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,640
machine can plummet into a ravine how

412
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,590
exactly is this helping what the since

413
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,120
when are they wearing parachutes and why

414
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,650
I swear to god this movie has conjured

415
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,210
up more magically appearing items than

416
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,130
JK Rowling this gun-slinging is actually

417
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,690
pretty damn creative and fun but there's

418
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,280
no possible way one of these Golden

419
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,990
Circle Jerks hasn't had time to reload

420
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,310
their automatic weapon and take this

421
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,720
lone gunman out for good in these

422
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,460
Gatling guns seriously not penetrate the

423
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,720
stone wall that Harry and eggsy are

424
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,130
taking cover behind these things are

425
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:03,660
super powerful right come on Moony

426
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,370
another magic out at this point we can

427
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,960
just call this X Mach another movie and

428
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,500
be done with it

429
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,790
first I've got to find a way to get back

430
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,930
up to that lab and retrieve more

431
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,730
antidote your super secret rendezvous

432
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,530
point was within eyesight of the lab but

433
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,030
wonder they found you in fact here's an

434
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,170
extra sin for their not finding you

435
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,880
sooner if you ever wanted to do more

436
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,540
than this

437
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,190
look H beat you're the one that took the

438
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,020
part and I assume they sent you the

439
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,940
script so this one's on you emailing

440
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,590
from poppy from a senior partner at the

441
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,580
firm they're coordinates yeah to the

442
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,800
facility in Italy not her secret hideout

443
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
it says it plain as day in the email why

444
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,250
would she arrange pick up at her

445
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,840
headquarters or send the coordinates

446
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,640
there ever I know the president decided

447
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,620
not to cave to Poppy's demands but did

448
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,820
he really commissioned the production of

449
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,290
all these cages or was there a caged

450
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,670
warehouse somewhere that finally got his

451
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,180
big break princess of Sweden who I might

452
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,860
remind you as a princess is somehow in

453
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,540
level 2 of the poison drug state without

454
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,040
someone rushing her to a hospital

455
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,230
poppy you expecting a lawyer - poppy

456
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,700
somehow didn't tell her gun-toting

457
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,990
henchmen that her lawyer was going to

458
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,070
show up tonight dogged you had one job

459
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,080
minesweeper also I thought land mines

460
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,340
blow up as soon as you step on them and

461
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,170
that they don't move technique we've

462
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,030
been taught movies is a lot but I guess

463
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,320
like bullets in the water and we only

464
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,030
use 10% of our brains this is the troop

465
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,350
that we have to accept except here

466
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,110
luckily I have this little known fact

467
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,910
luckily I have this was actually the

468
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,020
working title of this movie during

469
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,530
production

470
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,720
country row

471
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,430
I don't know how this can be perceived

472
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,170
as anything but a ruse but mooby's got a

473
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,680
movie I guess we're gonna really have to

474
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,310
dine here

475
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,930
we've seen them single-handedly take out

476
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,399
more goons than this before and in about

477
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,600
two minutes they will take out five

478
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,250
times this many why not just have Merlin

479
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,689
hold tight take out the guards and puppy

480
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,459
then deactivate the landline it would

481
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,930
literally be the least ridiculous thing

482
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,850
in the entire movie also don't worry in

483
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,410
the next sequel some other country will

484
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,730
be nearby monitoring low-level

485
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,959
frequencies might just happen to have

486
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,029
some mind reassimilation buddy so really

487
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,310
totes NBD once again henchmen decide not

488
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,750
to go for the legs after it's clear that

489
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,250
shooting the umbrella is not going to

490
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:53,899
work

491
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,250
wait a minute did the guy behind Harry

492
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,839
make a noise so loud in the middle of

493
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,189
the gunfire that Harry was able to turn

494
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,420
around and kill that guy before he got

495
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,740
the chance to kill him does anybody know

496
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,910
how to kill people before they're

497
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,750
detected anymore

498
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,459
by hell you've already seen this

499
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,810
briefcase be a rocket launcher and a

500
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,310
machine gun but now there's nothing

501
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,600
inside it even if I had an entire

502
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,129
suspension bridge it's believed it

503
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,509
wouldn't be enough I guess this is funny

504
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,250
I know sometimes the dark recesses of my

505
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,060
heart won't allow it

506
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,829
but this is a 70 year old recording

507
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,209
artist pulling off a martial arts move

508
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,560
and my brain can't handle that either

509
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,389
also a movie uses Elton John to break

510
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,009
the fourth wall and I can't even muster

511
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,540
any anger because it also broke my

512
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,800
spirit at least an hour ago

513
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,149
Harry shoots a thing that somehow works

514
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,980
luckily all bombs come in threes in this

515
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,420
world and this umbrella has an unlimited

516
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,220
supply of usefulness stocked inside it

517
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,779
you already broke that wall Elton there

518
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,189
are no walls left to break can we all

519
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,020
just go home now

520
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,480
we've already seen a dog operate at 76%

521
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,130
so why wouldn't he be able to come out

522
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,450
and play at 89%

523
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,279
which gives way first the human sternum

524
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,080
or a stone column wrong answer movie

525
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,130
knowing what we know about this

526
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,870
mechanical arm ex's chest should be a

527
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,390
crater right now he survives this all of

528
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,430
this like the whole movie mechanical

529
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,930
Dogma necessary rather than simply

530
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,190
killing him which is what they've been

531
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,200
doing the whole movie up until now LX

532
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,850
Jonica this has been possible the whole

533
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,430
time the whole time sure give her a

534
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,450
reason to take off the Elton John

535
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,630
failsafe you dick so my mate Brandon for

536
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,170
Roxy for JB formerly well awesome I'll

537
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,580
be alive if we ever decide to make

538
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,550
another sequel so oh god damn it I mean

539
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,839
I didn't forget about whiskey or

540
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,160
anything I was just hoping the movie did

541
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,209
and these are trained agents who

542
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,589
conveniently forget the agent for plot

543
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,270
sake you try anything funny or not

544
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,550
turning this thing electric so why don't

545
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,930
you already I'm just gonna spend the

546
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,250
next several minutes monologuing about

547
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,899
your very thin and very convenient

548
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,880
motives for wanting drug users dead none

549
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,260
of which is necessary since you easily

550
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,520
could have killed them both by now and

551
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,050
just let the infected druggies down I

552
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,300
think he sounds like a bright idea this

553
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,250
badass gun sling and lasso twirling

554
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,870
killer is essentially stopped by a very

555
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,640
bright light this is some now you see me

556
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,500
two bulls right here the president

557
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,750
actively sanctioned the deaths of

558
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,850
hundreds of millions of people there is

559
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,950
no way even with impeachment that they

560
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,360
would put handcuffs around the President

561
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,950
of the United States in the White House

562
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,660
it's even doubtful that the president

563
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,890
would be arrested or have to go through

564
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,240
any legal proceedings and there would be

565
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,350
a great debate as to whether his

566
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:10,199
decision was even illegal

567
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,880
strange things are afoot and the

568
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,659
circle-k

569
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,950
how is it I know what people taste like

570
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:25,500
[Music]

571
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,419
Soylent Green is made out of people

572
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,539
here's a new dragon fire cannot kill a

573
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:35,320
dragon

574
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm the dude

575
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,570
[Music]

576
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,390
you raped my sister you murdered her you

577
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,520
killed her children how did you take

578
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,620
down Captain America we shot him in the

579
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,510
legs because his shield is the size of a

580
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,000
dinner plate
