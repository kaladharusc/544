this brand new template given to us by

for those of you who are driven crazy

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,040
last time by the technical difficulty of

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,950
my camera being reversed it is no longer

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,800
reversed because I put a small amount of

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,129
effort into this rest a couple button

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,440
podcast experience here's the thing so

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,090
we talked a little bit about why we were

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,600
creating a podcast and the obvious

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,850
answer is what's the obvious answer you

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,129
guys know the obvious answer is money oh

27
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,850
yes I love talking friends right

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,369
I don't like neither of you oh wait no

29
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,729
but we currently have like any sponsors

30
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,130
or anything like that so I you know this

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,750
this stream brought to you once again by

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,390
the folks over at mrs. turpentine sass

33
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,009
sticks that's right if you know somebody

34
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,840
with a quality sass and they have a

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,430
stick up their ass it's probably a

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,280
quality stick missus turpentine a sticks

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,799
wouldn't have any sponsors way today

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,560
that they sell Aztecs or do they laces

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,000
no they'd sell the stick that goes in

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,130
your ass okay you can also get them for

41
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,369
free

42
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,320
minor hack you can get a mrs. turpentine

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,409
stick for free out of any sonic corndog

44
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,470
oh they also sell a device to remove

45
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,119
them they've really cornered the market

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,420
there is we need like a trust Buster for

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,140
mrs. turpentine a stakes if you are if

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,579
you're tuning in for the first time

49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,590
there's another episode of previously

50
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,750
that was recorded about what nine days

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,880
ten days back you listen to that as well

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,610
YouTube we had 50,000 views on the video

53
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,689
which is a lot better than I thought it

54
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:04,950
would do the watch time was through the

55
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,310
roof

56
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,079
YouTube didn't seem to want to share it

57
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,580
too terribly much but that seems to be

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,410
true of most content these days YouTube

59
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,400
this is kind of broke

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
a little bit but the real reason we're

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,939
doing this is not just because of money

62
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,650
we're doing it because I wanted an

63
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,049
opportunity to signal boost my friends

64
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,189

65
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,049

73
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,079
okay but we ran a poll last weekend that

74
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,959
poll will be live again this week asking

75

audio last week but that's just what

87

92
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:13,769
something

93
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,319

laugh at that

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,859
that's a good one but you expect to be

101
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,949

103
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,659
pretty silly 11 solid years of video

104
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,659
games years look let me tell you

105
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:45,989
something

106
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,409
the Year 2027 rolls around at the rate

107
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,419
it's going if we are all aren't hoping

108
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,290
to be dead by surprise I'm so I'm

109
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,659
holding that for cyberpunk 2077 after

110
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,129
that I can check out hey you know what

111
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,099
you know that's gonna release just 2077

112
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,690
that was what I was thinking yeah I

113
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,940
can't wait to go got a live another

114
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,150
entire fucking lifetime for that game

115
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,829
actually I heard I heard there was a

116
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,930
rumor floating around I mean you got to

117
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,250
be careful because Kotaku and those

118
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,320
websites they'll publish anything but um

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,329
you know same way I'll publish anything

120
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,409
as long as it gets views baby boy but

121
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,270
that said we'll publish anything but

122
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,540
there

123
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,460
has it they are fairly close to going

124
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,800
gold it might actually be on this

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,760
generation instead of the next

126
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,490
generation really I was expecting like

127
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,480
at least 2019 like late 2019 maybe 2020

128
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,490
right well that I mean that still falls

129
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,440
within this generation probably we're

130
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,480
probably get new consoles starting like

131
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,290
late 2019 okay which talks of that does

132
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,250
one of the things we wanted to talk

133
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,410
about this week is that Microsoft bought

134
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,940
up obsidian yes right yeah it's a bunch

135
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,220
of other studios so I have a little

136
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,550
minor leak here we went to e3 this last

137
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,320
year and we were talking to I was

138
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,120
talking to Mike uborrow

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,740
and Mike I'm gonna hurt you a little bit

140
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,540
Mike watches my content so he might be a

141
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,400
little mad when he sees but I'm talking

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
to Mike Ibarra and I'm like Mike can you

143
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,700
tell me why you guys just bought up like

144
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,330
five or six companies at the end of a

145
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,890
generation and he goes boogie you tell

146
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,870
me why do you think a company would do

147
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,170
that at the end of a generation and it's

148
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,510
like what's so that you can dominate the

149
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,860
next generation he goes well I'll

150
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,440
neither confirm nor deny that but that's

151
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,840
one good reason to buy up a bunch of

152
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,010
corporations to have a really good

153
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,380
launch title and so especially then to

154
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,210
not announce a bunch of projects they're

155
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,130
working on they brought up a bunch of of

156
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,990
studios and then said they're chillin

157
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,500
there they're waiting so basically he

158
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,530
implied in that conversation he said we

159
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,090
basically went in there to those

160
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,190
companies and said what project do you

161
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,960
want to make and like what's our budget

162
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,520
and he's like no I don't think you

163
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,150
understand

164
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,980
that's not our question our question is

165
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,190
what game do you want to make we were

166
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,870
Microsoft we have the budget whatever

167
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,580
game you want to make that's what you

168
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,500
get to make so what do you want to wake

169
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,050
what's your wildest dreams I don't know

170
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,130
if that's how it's gonna play out or not

171
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,300
you know I hope so

172
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,830
you know because you take a look at long

173
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,360
time now you take a look at every other

174
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,640
Microsoft exclusive this generation and

175
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,620
it was filled with microtransactions the

176
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,820
fort's the series probably being the

177
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,620
worst of it not the fort's of rising

178
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,270
series but the fort's of mainline series

179
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,730
just filled with yeah like throwing my

180
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,170
transactions I don't want I don't want

181
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,540
them city in game with with

182
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,310
microtransactions built in but Jacob

183
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,380
what what all obsidian games are you a

184
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,390
fan of what I mean obviously I in Vegas

185
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,450
my favorite is nicely a little public to

186
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,129
sift Lords but I

187
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,989
also really liked Alpha Protocol and if

188
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,429
we could get an alpha protocol sequel

189
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,199
going like obsidian if you're listening

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,889
to me please please I need a protocol

191
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,139
there what about Ellis what obsidian

192
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,509
games get you can get you turnin so I've

193
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,399
actually missed out on most of them I

194
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,259
played a little bit of New Vegas and

195
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,509
that was actually the game that kind of

196
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,459
made me realize that fallouts not my jam

197
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,300
and everybody was lukewarm on fallout 76

198
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,309
and I kind of went into it expecting

199
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,899
that and I think I had a better time

200
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,269
than most of the die-hard fans did

201
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,649
because I didn't have very high

202
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,509
expectations

203
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,279
the only obsidian game that I really got

204
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,319
super excited about was new vegas and if

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,699
you look at the history i was watching a

206
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,619
video based on the history of new vegas

207
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:21,959
they had to turn that game around in

208
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,550
like 18 months and they got a lot of

209
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,599
trouble like a lot of people are upset

210
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,249
that it was a full-fledged full-price

211
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,129
game but it used reused a lot of assets

212
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,929
from like fallout 3 but if you look at

213
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,059
the 18-month window they had to create

214
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:34,589
that game of course they had to reuse

215
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,019
assets of course they did but that said

216
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:39,539
what an incredible game like that that's

217
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,119
my real experience with obsidian yeah

218
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:42,659
yeah

219
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,490
did you played a lot of stick of truth

220
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,709
too didn't you you like stats obsidian

221
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,050
yeah oh my god yes stick of truth and

222
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,189
what's the fallout they make the

223
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:52,740
follow-up as well no no fractured but

224
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,740
whole they did not I don't know who did

225
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,050
though yeah I really enjoyed both but

226
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,159
they did like the the pillars of

227
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,740
eternity series tyranny were there

228
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,709
mustn't games I actually loved pillars

229
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,059
of eternity that kind of slipped my mind

230
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,099
that that was obsidian though yeah yeah

231
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,240
they reached out to me during the

232
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
pillars of eternity two sages like we'd

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,389
love to like have you review the guy was

234
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,740
just like so depressed the first time I

235
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,089
wasn't able to do it sure but yeah

236
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,499
they're incredibly I guess they're aware

237
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,059
of me of sitting we love you I hope

238
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,800
Microsoft treats you fair who are the

239
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,939
other companies Jacob can you google

240
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,319
that real quick for us who are the

241
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,429
companies that um

242
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,099
Microsoft has purchased because they

243
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,169
picked up some pretty big-name companies

244
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,729
and Chad if you want to help us out with

245
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,889
that as well but if they picked up like

246
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,569
four or five here's the biggest issue

247
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,189
that I have is if you look at a company

248
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:38,250
like Rare look what they did to rare

249
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,949
rare got to make like one non connected

250
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,480
game since they got bought up and it was

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,730
sea of thieves which was yeah

252
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,130
disappointing I was disappointing it

253
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,750
felt unfinished if

254
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,140
like not a full title you know right

255
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,590
that was like a $20 early access or hey

256
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,390
come play our fun little game that we

257
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,310
have not a $60 full release triple-a

258
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,320
money sink is what it felt like somebody

259
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,760
mentioned in chat too by the way that

260
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,250
PlayStation cancelled the PlayStation

261
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,170
experience this year and now they are

262
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,470
also cancelling III they are not going

263
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,170
to participate in e3 this year and yeah

264
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,120
yeah so I was curious what do you guys

265
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,730
think about that

266
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,020
that's surprising because people are

267
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,460
really interested in a lot of the things

268
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,140
they have coming out like Dennis ranting

269
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,780
I know that that was a pretty big deal I

270
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,910
guess a lot of the things we saw at the

271
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,740
previous e3 have since come out like

272
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,180
spider-man that was a big one ever it

273
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,710
was really pumped about I think this is

274
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,660
a humorous style decision I think

275
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,730
they've decided we don't need III

276
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,110
anymore I think they're trying to do

277
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,670
what Nintendo did and just start doing

278
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,650
like Nintendo directs or like

279
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,110
PlayStation directs or something but I

280
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,190
think cancelling the PlayStation

281
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,120
experience was a huge huge mistake

282
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,960
because that's one of my favorite times

283
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,430
I've been to almost every PlayStation

284
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,100
experience there was and it's just a

285
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,540
good time and it's a great place to

286
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,490
market the games is a great place to get

287
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,870
back to the players to the gamers it's

288
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,400
so frustrating that they're not doing

289
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,380
that and then a not have a presence at

290
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,880
e3 this year they don't plan to do

291
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
something just before e3 or after e3 it

292
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
kind of this kills the e3 in a lot of

293
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,370
ways I mean it's you know it's it's kind

294
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,800
of bizarre to see them do that so I for

295
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,790
those of you what are the lists to hear

296
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,810
me talk a little bit of shit about

297
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,670
Playstation I'll do it gladly

298
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,610
I think PlayStation is is going to fall

299
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,290
on their own hubris here and there I

300
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,570
think they've chosen to set on their

301
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,450
laurels this generation you guys don't

302
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,220
know this part but it's difficult to get

303
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,050
PlayStation to work with youtubers

304
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,550
anymore it's difficult to get them to

305
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,070
work with strangers anymore yet they're

306
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,620
super concerned about like getting sued

307
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,630
out not just me I mean my personal

308
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,830
experiences with them has been pretty

309
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,630
much the same the whole time but I've

310
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,690
heard from other youtubers that Sony is

311
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,220
kind of hesitant to even give out review

312
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,560
codes sometimes anymore so it's just

313
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,020
it's it's it's a company that seems to

314
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,580
be making a lot of bad decisions and if

315
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,530
you look at the people who are there at

316
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,160
the launch of

317
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,040
playstation4 he had Jack Trenton Adam

318
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,750
boys you had all these really really

319
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,610
great people who are the forefront shoe

320
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,529
they still there of course but you know

321
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,269
still there but um so many of these

322
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:16,879
people have abandoned the company and

323
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,170
maybe it was maybe it's because of the

324
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,699
leadership change or maybe they saw

325
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,110
things changing in the way that they

326
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,420
were going but I really feel like Xbox

327
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,029
is poised to regrab the market in this

328
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,230
next generation which I think we're

329
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,050
gonna see in 2020 so what all companies

330
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,639
is Microsoft purchased did you look it

331
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,069
up yes sir that took a second so they're

332
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,629
close to acquiring obsidian I think

333
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,759
that's definitely gonna happen and then

334
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,889
they acquired playground games which did

335
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,800
a Forza horizon for ninja theory which

336
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,240
did huh blade sin was sacrifice

337
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,300
compulsion games which released we happy

338
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,569
few

339
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,879
and then undead labs which released

340
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,449
state of decay yes I brought all of

341
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,100
those companies in so that they are now

342
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,829
all first party developers I could not

343
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,899
get into state of decay and they saved

344
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,509
my life I tried so hard it's yeah it's

345
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,579
it's just the the kind of worst parts of

346
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,639
a colony simulation game I wish I wish

347
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,649
there's parts of we happy few that I

348
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,870
liked but there was definitely parts of

349
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,029
it I did not like I I'm not a big fan of

350
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:16,290
the survivors or honor and I felt like

351
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,519
they felt right into that traffic should

352
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,380
never been a survival game should have

353
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,959
been a narrative driven non procedurally

354
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,009
generated game should've been just a

355
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,509
really good story based game and it

356
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:24,930
wasn't

357
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,110
I heard amazing things about I can't

358
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,560
remember how to say that's a new a new

359
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,600
hell bike so I played through hell blade

360
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,819
and got bored halfway through so I

361
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,470
decided to watch somebody play the last

362
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,170
half um because like it was very much

363
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,300
pretty self-explanatory puzzle solving

364
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,470
and I didn't really enjoy the puzzle

365
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,029
solving and then the combat was kind of

366
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,800
lukewarm what was amazing about it the

367
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,839
engine was amazing the graphics were

368
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,720
amazing the story was amazing the actual

369
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,180
gameplay was not that great I'm very

370
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,250
eager to see what that company will do

371
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,309
yes yeah absolutely because that was you

372
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,139
know they made that game with a team if

373
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,240
I think like less than 20 people and it

374
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,939
was one of my games of the year for 2017

375
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,069
it deserves it it's definitely an

376
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,439
incredible experience um I think even if

377
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,939
you just watch somebody else play it you

378
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,579
should but the puzzle solving was I

379
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,170
never liked puzzle solving you know I

380
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:16,579
was kind of

381
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,129
gone war this year so yeah a

382
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,689
specifically the way they were doing the

383
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:21,829
puzzle solving is just kind of like

384
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,059
looking around for the right room

385
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,649
somewhere on a wall or something it was

386
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:27,439
kind of weird but yeah but yeah it's a

387
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,089
story anytime you ever talk about mental

388
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:30,920
illness in a video game I'm into it I

389
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,350
like how I play on the pressure question

390
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,049
so in the was that was the first company

391
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,610
on that list

392
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,420
oh playground games the for its horizon

393
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,639
14 yeah the firts arise in series is

394
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,259
without a doubt one of my favorite

395
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,480
series and I finally installed my code

396
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,279
for Forza horizon for and started

397
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,559
digging into it and my god is that game

398
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,689
good and I love the Xbox one axe I'm not

399
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:54,889
gonna lie like I feel like a traitor

400
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,769
sometimes but my ex is so good like I'm

401
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,839
playing Red Dead Redemption to still and

402
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,730
I'm playing that native 4k so I'm pretty

403
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,879
happy to see Microsoft poised to do well

404
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,519
in 2020 let's hope for they knock it out

405
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,139
of the park yeah they don't do too well

406
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,749
this year because we've seen what a one

407
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:14,480
generation of it's a lot of PlayStation

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,610
3 era thinking going on right now it

409
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,040
feels like a PlayStation yeah yes but

410
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,899
the games are oh my god the games have

411
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,179
been incredible this year yeah so it's

412
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,069
Oscar Hunter was fantastic I bought a

413
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,709
PlayStation 4 Monster Hunter and of

414
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,389
course you've got Spider Man which was

415
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,189
absolutely incredible wall to wall just

416
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:32,629
from front of it I finally need to

417
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:33,949
download the DLC for that but who has

418
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,410
time with yeah this time of year the

419
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,059
holidays and all the games are out then

420
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,779
we have God of War which is immoral and

421
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,429
I guess there's a few games still coming

422
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,929
out that they haven't done there's like

423
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,449
the zombie one do I forget that one's

424
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,279
called like day one or something like

425
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,360
that one day

426
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,600
it's this survival style zombies

427
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,549
you know Walking Dead style something

428
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,499
that you're proceeding looked innovative

429
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:58,939
cuz it had like a ridiculous amount of

430
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,860
zombies on the screen all at once no

431
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,459
come

432
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,639
oh and apparently they bought Microsoft

433
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,679
also bought in exile Studios which is

434
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,980
cold math effects ah yes oh really

435
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,739
mm-hmm which has been it's interesting

436
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,389
to see what they come up with because

437
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,399
one of the biggest turn offs or path of

438
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,839
Excel for me is that that game looks

439
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,499
terrible

440
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,169
I gotta tell you I really stalled it and

441
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,749
so screamed it the other day and it

442
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,369
looks a lot better than it did

443
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,709
oh yeah console version looks like dog

444
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,019
crap but I was surprised at how good

445
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:31,879
the PC version looks like it looks like

446
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,139
Nathan might have been a graphical a

447
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,360
basis last time I played it and there

448
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,889
was a lot of really like cool little

449
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,170
bonus things going on like I know

450
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,809
there's like the the delving content and

451
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,249
like they're seasonal content that game

452
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,509
yeah mechanically brilliant it's been

453
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,970
good since I don't know like the first

454
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,610
expansion and it just to keep piling on

455
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,819
more and more and more and more and if

456
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:57,470
you want to play the Diablo gameplay

457
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,600
path of Exile yep I just wish it looked

458
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,739
better and I understand why it doesn't

459
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,079
because they didn't have a budget mm-hmm

460
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,749
um there's a ridiculous amount of

461
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,160
content there for free and basically the

462
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,660
only thing that affects gameplay that

463
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,730
you need to pay for is stash tabs

464
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,319
everything else is cosmic huh so you can

465
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,790
basically the game for free as much as

466
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,869
you want yep

467
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:16,489
I just give them a couple bucks it's

468
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,809
worth it you'll buy it for the stash

469
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,459
you'll buy some stashed at some point

470
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,660
you'll put like 20 bucks into that

471
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,279
yes currency system hands-down

472
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,619
absolutely so as of the recording of

473
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:30,220
this you can pick up fallout 76 for $35

474
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,809
that's true the game has been out for

475
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,939
about a week you think that'll bump it

476
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,129
up on the list that spyro because

477
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,249
currently it is lagging behind Spyro the

478
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,959
Spyro you make is I mean I'm will

479
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,629
laughing but it's damn good honest I was

480
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,610
really impressed but is it just a remake

481
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,980
of the original spiral yeah it's in its

482
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,049
its remaster and it's a remastered

483
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,149
trilogy right it's all three games dead

484
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,920
yeah if you look like the first Spyro

485
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,639
what if you look at I want to go to

486
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,529
Metacritic well it's C so the reviews

487
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:03,499
are finally coming out for fallout 76 we

488
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,720
have a friend by the way who is very

489
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,689
defensive about fallout 76 oh we do yeah

490
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,089
it's our good friend Flint who plays the

491
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,000
brother in my videos oh yeah very

492
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,380
defensive of the game because he enjoys

493
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,539
it quite a bit it's so Mike Scott for

494
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,740
Flint or anybody else who's watching

495
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,380
this right now if you enjoy fallout 76 I

496
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,199
am NOT shaming you at all you enjoy what

497
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,089
you enjoy man whether it's for tonight

498
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,610
or fallout 76 or candy crush I'm not

499
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,100
here to judge I'm here to say you like

500
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,830
whatever game you like I'm not here to

501
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,899
judge you I am here to judge the game

502
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:39,559
based on its individual merits and so

503
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,559
the user scores have been just bombarded

504
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,200
on Medicare

505
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,070
at this point with a 2.9 generally

506
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,799
unfavorable reviews but the critics

507
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,230
score 26 reviews finally in now and

508
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,320
we're at a 55 yeah yeah that's slower

509
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,210
than the days where most people won't go

510
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,820
below a 7 yeah that's that's a pretty

511
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,460
interesting point and so long story

512
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,039
short there the complaints that people

513
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,889
have about fallout 76 we all played it a

514
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,090
little bit right we all played the best

515
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,850
yeah yeah I did buy retail I wish I

516
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,740
waited to I was 35 bucks to buy retail I

517
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,690
can't believe how fast it's dropped

518
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,549
that's got to be embarrassing right as a

519
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,440
company yeah and they and they need to

520
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,120
whose dog is that was my dog Sammy sorry

521
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,490
about that guys but but we talked about

522
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,289
in the last podcast we'll talk about it

523
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,059
again here the reason the complaint I

524
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,380
have about it it's not that it's a bad

525
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,490
game on paper it's a lot of people are

526
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,139
upset that it's not a fallout game it

527
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,850
does use the follow-up graphics it does

528
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,110
use the fallout engine it does use the

529
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,029
fallout world and it reuses a lot of the

530
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,010
game mechanics and assets from fallout 4

531
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,950
but what most people consider a fallout

532
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,260
game new vegas fallout 3 fallout 4 this

533
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,169
is the game I played is the story right

534
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,450
you know fallout 3 yeah you know you you

535
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,940
you try to kill your dad or you save

536
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,500
your dad and follow up before you either

537
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,990
try to kill your son or save your son

538
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,039
and then fallout 76 you're killing you

539
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,669
know dragons just doing whatever

540
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,010
wandering around surviving and I feel

541
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,139
like this entire game was set up so that

542
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,580
it was much easier to show your friends

543
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,279
the cool base that you built instead of

544
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,840
having to get him over to your house so

545
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,639
that they could look at your TV you

546
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,019
could just like build a cool base and

547
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,880
then they were like well we can add some

548
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,000
like game stuff around this right mm-hmm

549
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,070
and that that's that's pretty much it

550
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,630
yeah I'm it's meant to be just a cool

551
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,750
online experience and as far as online

552
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,929
survival games go whether it's your you

553
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:39,840
know rusts or your whatever whatever

554
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,620
else arcs

555
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,940
I think arc is probably the

556
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,580
quintessential one in that market done

557
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,500
very well yeah this one's okay it's

558
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,039
buggy

559
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,429
it's got issues it's got stuff and

560
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,480
there's a ton of content there it's a

561
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,309
giant map there's a lot of little weird

562
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,590
little perks and easter eggs and and it

563
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,059
does take place in the fall of 7

564
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,769
the following universe he's definitely

565
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,230
not a mainline fallout game but I think

566
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,549
it's I think the reason the critics are

567
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,019
so harsh on it I think the reason

568
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,399
players are so harsh on this cuz it

569
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,230
doesn't feel like a true Fallout game I

570
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,730
think you're reasonable critics are so

571
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,139
harsh on ER that's because of how buggy

572
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,720
and how incomplete it released I need

573
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,370
that's that's my problem with it as it

574
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,409
feels incomplete there's there's a lot

575
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,350
to do and none of it's that fun to do

576
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,419
right and and and so I think I think a

577
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,210
year later if this game had come out a

578
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,340
year later or even push it back to March

579
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,019
I think I think would have done a lot

580
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,249
better but there's a very interesting

581
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:31,409
video out there big shout out to the

582
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:33,179
youtuber who made this I believe it's

583
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:38,100
the Dreamcast guy it's a I think it's

584
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,379
him on YouTube I am not 100% sure I'll

585
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:42,149
try to figure out who it is but I

586
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,889
watched a video on YouTube talking about

587
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:47,090
it the video basically described sorry

588
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,740
basically described what happened to

589
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,639
fallout 76 and he said that he meant

590
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,619
some of the developers of the game and

591
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,110
those developers basically said that

592
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,999
there was no real like push to make it a

593
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,889
great game they always had a release

594
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,480
date and it didn't matter how close they

595
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,309
got to the release date they were always

596
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,299
going really something that day no

597
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,440
matter what the state of the game was

598
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,110
there was never really any feedback from

599
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,330
the the sub earnest or anything like

600
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,350
that the community team never really

601
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,259
communicated with them and that overall

602
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:21,389
it's like Todd Howard wasn't really

603
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:23,070
hands on in this they knew that this

604
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,840
game would make money no matter what so

605
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,960
it had a small resource base with a

606
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,940
small team and it was going to release

607
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,110
in whatever state it was going to

608
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,429
release in because they knew it would

609
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,249
make money yeah and so in a lot of ways

610
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:37,110
it's easy to compare that to say maybe

611
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,529
Diablo or mortal or fallout shelter or

612
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,840
any of these games like how we release

613
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,639
movies now I mean that's why every movie

614
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,980
is part of a franchise exactly right it

615
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,659
says you don't have to spend time on

616
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,100
them there's no push for like a

617
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,230
particularly good script or getting

618
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,419
anything new or innovative because

619
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,039
people will come back in for that old

620
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,049
familiar member berri slap the

621
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,809
Cloverfield name on it even though it's

622
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,240
clearly not a Cloverfield movie yeah and

623
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,429
whatever man let's just make money off

624
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,409
of it right now you loved the

625
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,580
Cloverfield what was the one with John

626
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,460
yes 10 Cloverfield Lane was great that

627
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,600
was actually a pretty good movie yeah

628
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
it's not great paradox was not great not

629
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,370
even good no eyes neither but I felt

630
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,020
even a little bit like a Cloverfield

631
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,330
movie yeah I skipped I skip to paradox I

632
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,620
think it was the dreamcast guy i'll try

633
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,330
to i fight if i do figure out who

634
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,040
actually made that video I'll list it

635
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,930
down below but I don't know what he's

636
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,460
saying is true or not you know I'm not

637
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,250
gonna think as a source you know and I'm

638
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,630
not I just repeating there is a video

639
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,620
out there saying that kind of stuff

640
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,840
about that but you're exactly right it's

641
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,670
exactly let's just push out another game

642
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,590
let's make some quick money let's let's

643
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,300
it doesn't really matter if it's that

644
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,220
good quality we have a franchise its

645
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,750
build something on the franchise put the

646
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,280
name on it you saw it we've seen that

647
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,200
with sonic games for generations how did

648
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,360
that work out for Sega you know let's

649
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,130
let's not start doing that with beloved

650
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,620
franchises like Diablo like Warcraft

651
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,280
even you know or or certainly certainly

652
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,320
the Fallout series I don't know I wonder

653
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,750
if like these are these are all by Pease

654
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,880
now right I mean these these IDs have

655
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,200
been around for so long and I'm

656
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,780
wondering if the companies are just

657
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,910
trying to see like how how big of that

658
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,650
punch can they take you know how much

659
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,960
goodwill do we have and how much of it

660
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,330
can we squander on titles like 76 or

661
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,680
diablo immortal and i'm part of the

662
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,030
problem because they didn't send me a

663
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,340
review code for fallout 76 they say they

664
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,350
send like some youtubers like free

665
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,240
copies of the collector's edition I wish

666
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,510
ain't Bethesda would like I would like a

667
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,970
fall at helmet thank you but I don't

668
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,230
even get like a review copy of the game

669
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,000
and I have contacts at Bethesda I'm like

670
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,010
hey can I get a review copy radio

671
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,600
silence cuz I think they know I'm gonna

672
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,890
crap all over they might already cracked

673
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,990
open a bit you know

674
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,640
but that said it I don't know it just

675
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,360
feels like Bethesda Blizzard so many

676
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,950
companies are burning bridges everybody

677
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,450
just seems so tone-deaf

678
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,000
I think it's I mean with Blizzard

679
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,380
specifically it's because they're not

680
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,880
Blizzard anymore they're Activision

681
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,310
Blizzard and the emphasis is just every

682
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,260
year more and more on the Activision and

683
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,410
that's how they release games it's it's

684
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,170
what we see it's all more of a push for

685
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,240
monetization and less of a push for hey

686
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,620
I have an idea for a game I want to make

687
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,800
that I think will be fun yep yeah and

688
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,480
that's what I'm hoping that's what I'm

689
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,530
hoping this next generation

690
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,780
that's you know what Mike Ibarra when he

691
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,820
told me that at the 3:00 I was just so

692
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,230
excited I'm just so excited that I

693
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,790
really hope that's a place where we can

694
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,470
get that we're just letting companies

695
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,790
build whatever they want we're not

696
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,170
worried about the bottom line that's

697
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,460
what made this generation of

698
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,500
Playstations so good

699
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,330
they could have monetized god of war if

700
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,620
you plate I guess you guys didn't play

701
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,450
God of War but God of War has like some

702
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,420
stuff that obviously could have been DLC

703
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,430
like there's this miss tone where you

704
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,870
can it kind of plays like a roguelike

705
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,780
thing if that had been a $15 DLC I'd

706
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,550
have bought it but it wasn't it was just

707
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,280
part of the game yeah Monster Hunter had

708
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,690
it like from the very beginning said

709
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,100
that they will continually release

710
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,070
monsters and content and new modes for

711
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,380
free for the game's entire lifespan

712
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,420
right so there's just been some

713
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,920
incredible stuff going over in

714
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,870
PlayStation if a spot if Xbox could re

715
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,360
capture that I don't know man the gaming

716
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,590
industry had a lot of hope for them

717
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,240
picking up all of these studios and

718
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,530
going to them and saying what do you

719
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,150
want to make let's make it mm-hmm

720
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,280
let's take over the next generation it

721
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,600
gives me a lot of hope yes especially

722
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,460
with the studios that they acquired it

723
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,160
seems like they tried to pinpoint people

724
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,560
with a lot of different kinds of skills

725
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,610
that make a lot of different kinds of

726
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,310
games that are good and beloved

727
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,290
so speaking of beloved games we are all

728
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,180
currently in our various stages of

729
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,520
playing Pokemon let's go Vanek fun I

730
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,070
just picked up my second-to-last gym

731
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,560
badge I'm going down Route 19 fighting

732
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,860
off all the swimmers so that's been it's

733
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,420
been easy yep right in the beginning of

734
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,700
the game quite easy mm-hmm yeah it's

735
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,170
very easy doesn't zip easy on my Pikachu

736
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,010
and that move is it's absurd it's it's

737
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,110
like you push a to win every single time

738
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,970
there's not really any reason for me to

739
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,550
even worry about tight matching or you

740
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,990
know collecting a powerful team of

741
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,210
Pokemon I can just use that Pokemon and

742
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,610
that move for the whole game so I will

743
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,620
play devil's advocate here and say that

744
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,630
Pikachu can just ride your shoulder he

745
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,180
can just be there for his link sir if

746
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,310
you want to play that game in a more

747
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,260
challenging way and I have chosen to do

748
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,010
some gems like this make some character

749
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,230
just a regular Pokemon that you picked

750
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,410
up

751
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,260
that doesn't happen at Sivan and have

752
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,510
him be the right level to make that gym

753
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,010
challenging if you want to do that

754
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,720
the problem is innately it's difficult

755
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,400
to choose to do that I feel like it's

756
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,520
they made the game easy to play and so

757
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,930
unless you purposely make it difficult

758
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,460
for yourself it's not going to be

759
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,650
difficult yet how much of the onus is

760
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,660
there on the player to you know set your

761
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,480
own challenges but if you do want to

762
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,740
pick up that game and you do want it to

763
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,150
be challenging then you just take

764
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,370
Pikachu out or Eevee out of your party

765
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,230
and then just start building up a

766
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,550
pokemon on your own it's going to be

767
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,170
about as easy as any Pokemon game at

768
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,550
that point so what do you think about

769
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,410
the capture system that's my curious in

770
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,150
my curia because I after playing with it

771
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,790
for so much I prefer it to doing this

772
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,460
absolutely absolutely I'm completely

773
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,350
done fighting wild Pokemon from here on

774
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,990
out I just I will be annoyed if the next

775
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,340
main line game is like that which you

776
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,560
probably will be

777
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,570
it just takes so much time and it's not

778
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,280
like it's fun it's not that's not an

779
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,680
enjoyable loop right right yeah I never

780
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,450
found them to be that great honestly and

781
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,150
I random encounters is fine if they go

782
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,580
back to random encounters I'll be fine

783
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,880
yeah but I would prefer I you know I do

784
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,400
like I do like the compromise of being

785
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,230
able to fight Snorlax for example as the

786
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,610
first character first monster that I

787
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,470
fought you had to defeat him first and

788
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,390
then ball capture if we go back to

789
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,000
having to weaken Pokemon first can we go

790
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,820
to knocking them out entirely and then

791
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,680
having the choice whether or not to try

792
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,260
to capture like yeah well because the

793
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,700
way they do that with the legendaries

794
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,680
the way they did it with Snorlax such a

795
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,990
better system than trying to knock it

796
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,300
down or having to use which is the the

797
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,830
swipe that knocks them down to one hit

798
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,800
point a false swipe yeah yeah false

799
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,170
swipe installed on my main Pokemon just

800
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,490
so I can capture shit like it's so

801
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,060
frustrating

802
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,760
yeah so what do we look like the the

803
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,400
combo system as well increasing the

804
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,430
shiny rate and also increasing the IV's

805
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,580
so you know okay I'll use the fourth

806
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,190
Magikarp that I find instead of the

807
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,820
first one

808
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,890
it makes it more fun to grind it may

809
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,690
gives me a reason to just sort of stay

810
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,880
in one area and keep catching pidgeys or

811
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,750
whatever it is no players have found out

812
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,210
the best loop for Maxima if you're not

813
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,800
trying to like catch a shiny of a

814
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,790
particular type

815
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,800
if whatever the highest-level area that

816
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,170
you can catch chancy's in Chauncey has

817
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,270
is the it's the character that's worth

818
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,310
the most XP it's considered rare in most

819
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,900
areas so if you want to farm chances you

820
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,640
want to use lures in that area and

821
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,470
obviously if you're in postgame content

822
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,940
you want to do the cave the the high

823
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,310
level Pokemon unlike the 8090 levels but

824
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,230
what our content yeah there's postgame

825
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,670
content oh there's a ridiculous amount

826
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,770
of postgame content there is a trainer

827
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,550
for every type of Pokemon all 150 one of

828
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,400
the og Pokemon and so you can you get a

829
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,170
little badge for each trainer you have

830
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,250
to fight the argonite trainer you have

831
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,360
to fight the chance to trainer you have

832
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,890
to fight the Bulbasaur trainer and if

833
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,440
you defeat all of those trainers I don't

834
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,400
know what you get for it if you get

835
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,750
anything it's probably bragging rights

836
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,000
but postgame content after victory

837
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,860
rotom's and solving the story that you

838
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,000
then have a hundred and fifty one

839
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,730
trainers to defeat so there's a ton of

840
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,740
bonus content this time around that's

841
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,180
good um and of course they're still

842
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,070
online matches and stuff like that I

843
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,720
don't like the online trading system but

844
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,460
anyway for those who look at a level up

845
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,870
your pokemons quit it's not good at

846
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,450
online anything do never happen if

847
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,520
you're looking to do an online Pokemon

848
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,370
chain you want to catch an sees for the

849
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,250
highest XP and then try to get as many

850
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,320
bonuses as you can and obviously the

851
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,670
highest level chances that you can catch

852
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,320
as a way to do it use lures and you

853
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
level up your pokemons so stupidly fast

854
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,370
we're talking yes four thousand five

855
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,590
thousand per capture with the right

856
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,000
combo and for those you don't know the

857
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,290
trick if you're going to play on a

858
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,690
television anyway use both controllers

859
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,980
have you seen this trick it's really

860
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,050
smart there's a little device that came

861
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,400
with your Wii U's where you could slide

862
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,720
your two controllers and you have to

863
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,700
make a more normal controller if you use

864
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,180
that device and throw two balls at once

865
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,790
you will get a an additional bonus a

866
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,100
synchronicity bonus because it makes a

867
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,080
second players in the game but since

868
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,720
they're very literally together and so

869
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,550
if you can have one side to use ultra

870
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,320
balls use the other side use basic balls

871
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,600
you'll get the synchronicity multiplier

872
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,090
and it's it's just another way to level

873
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,320
faster if you're gonna play on

874
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,120
television anyways no reason not to play

875
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,060
it that way my my main knock against

876
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,250
this game is not how easy it is that's

877
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,350
fine I can get over that the fact that

878
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,020
you can't do anything without motion

879
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,230
controls everything you everything you

880
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,790
do like catching and stuff requires

881
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,040
motion controls

882
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,170
that sucks as someone who get big fan of

883
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,930
accessibility mmm Nintendo as a comedy

884
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,760
who's a big fan of accessibility I have

885
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,200
a good number of friends he loved to

886
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,030
play these games who were excited about

887
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,830
the Nintendo switch because of the

888
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,330
removable joy cones because there aren't

889
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,070
one hand is here one hand is here you

890
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,200
know the muscular dystrophy or whatever

891
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
their disability is it made it so much

892
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,650
easier from the play and now we have a

893
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,120
game that you can't turn off motion

894
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,340
controls why Nintendo that's very

895
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,440
frustrating absolutely meanwhile we have

896
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,990
Xbox over here creating accessibility

897
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,460
controllers for the place they are for

898
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,340
the Xbox and for the for PC they were

899
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,810
doing these ridiculously I don't we've

900
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,100
seen their excess we saw those at e3

901
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,620
they are amazing Nintendo won't even

902
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,060
turn off motion controls now admittedly

903
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,070
if you do have you played this and

904
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,960
Pokemon let's go in handheld mode

905
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,930
I guess yeah yes that's mostly what I

906
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,940
play it infinitely better in handheld

907
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,680
mode it is better it's still motion

908
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,100
controls and I did buy the the Pokemon

909
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,630
ball of the ball which is kind of

910
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,160
pointless as a joy con it's not

911
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,110
particularly good I love it for Pokemon

912
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,720
go oh yeah I don't know if I think they

913
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,490
coded it where you can only get one you

914
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,050
out of it but we will pair it well I

915
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,640
just need to borrow it right but I'm

916
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,740
saying I think it's got a chip in there

917
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,750
that says somebody said online one mew

918
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,150
per ball oh yeah I just want you to

919
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,290
trade it to me and then I'll trade it

920
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:16,770
right back

921
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,810
0:04 completely pokey I don't care about

922
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,640
having a mute oh okay I like every time

923
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,640
you I he's sexy yeah we'll do some

924
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,770
traits because all I need is weird you

925
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,970
have to do if you've done an online

926
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,130
trade yet for this game yes yeah

927
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,190
we've been trading all over our discord

928
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,210
Pokemon you should definitely be doing

929
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,310
it early on to level up quicker too

930
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,390
because you know trade your Pokemon

931
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,400
level quicker so yeah a lot of times

932
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,990
online I've just been trading here's an

933
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,100
eddorian or for net array no here is

934
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,620
this and relax for Snorlax alright but

935
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,940
do it as early as you can cuz I spoke

936
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,940
about a level faster but yeah you have

937
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,440
to do this weird system where you pick

938
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,740
three three Pokemon and you can't like

939
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,240
pair with somebody specifically if you

940
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,340
want to but you come to say our code is

941
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,810
going to be pigeon pit Picchi Pidgey

942
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,620
squirtle right yeah

943
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,420
and then someone who enters that same

944
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,130
thing but if you don't if you're not

945
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,170
arrange to do it quickly as well you

946
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,460
just have to wait till somebody else

947
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,400
types in Pidgey Pidgey squirtle and if

948
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,780
they don't you just set there for

949
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,050
forever

950
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,450
yep all right so you can create random

951
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,100
rooms cuz a lot of people just sit in

952
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,930
the the Pikachu Pikachu Pikachu room

953
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,190
yeah

954
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,590
tile so there's no wonder trading in the

955
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,700
game which was one of my favorite

956
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,130
features of previous games that's kind

957
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,500
of a wonder trade yeah I guess so as

958
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,560
good as I'm gonna get but fallout 76 was

959
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,300
a game I expected to not like and I

960
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,490
didn't like it I expected to not say

961
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,340
let's go and I loved it I'm really

962
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,170
enjoying yeah it's easy and just

963
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,730
relaxing as fun as in one night on

964
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,410
stream I spent three hours just catching

965
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,820
gas least trying to find a shiny which I

966
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,430
never did I spent three hours the other

967
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,770
night watching a movie in bed I'll just

968
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,070
catching Vulpix is hoping to get a shiny

969
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,080
and just grinding up the clean realizing

970
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,030
game for that right yeah it's yes it's a

971
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,350
nice little grinding game that's what I

972
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,000
always wanted from a Pokemon game is a

973
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,150
nice handheld grind while I do others

974
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,090
something else yeah that premise is it

975
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,530
weird buying a switch for no you know

976
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,900
what's - Wyatt - which four is breath a

977
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,580
while all the other games that are on

978
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,120
the this is just one other ten

979
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,550
incredible games so I have a question

980
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,500
for you guys we all already on switches

981
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,030
but if you didn't own a switch would you

982
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,150
buy knowing that there's a rumor that

983
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,470
2019 will show a brand new switch with

984
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,910
brand new hardware with brand new perks

985
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,940
on it would you wait or would you buy

986
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,060
one this Christmas if you find one so if

987
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,260
I found one on sale I would absolutely

988
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,669
vile in this game yeah I would buy the

989
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:39,400
one on sale I can't wait to play Zelda

990
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,070
games ever right and the best news is if

991
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,500
you don't own a switch yet the ones

992
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,179
they're selling right now as far as I

993
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:50,860
know still have that on chip hack

994
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,580
ability right so if you buy this one and

995
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,650
then decide later to upgrade to the new

996
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,200
switch you would be able to turn this

997
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,170
switch into a homebrew system which I

998
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,180
would never encourage or deny you to do

999
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,890
and I and I would actively discourage

1000
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,240
you to do it because if you ever connect

1001
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,100
that switch online Nintendo will brick

1002
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,050
it for you yeah they will ban your

1003
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,690
account if you connected online so I do

1004
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,430
and especially use it for cheating so

1005
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,080
don't do these things

1006
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,260
who ever there are people out there who

1007
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,300
do that so I'm saying you might be able

1008
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,980
to sell it to somebody who would be

1009
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,120
interested in doing that with your old

1010
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,220
switch I would encourage you to

1011
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,910
personally

1012
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,829
do it and then download a homebrew

1013
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:31,990
emulator and then play every video game

1014
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,450
ever made for free no you shouldn't do

1015
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,789
that oh never at least not never not

1016
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:40,390
yeah because you know I mean pay for

1017
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,770
your games what do you guys think about

1018
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,030
Nintendo online now that you've had a

1019
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,140
little bit of time to pay for it have

1020
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,960
you paid for it I have paid for it

1021
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,289
I've played doctor Mario quite a bit and

1022
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,569
I started to play the Zelda game but

1023
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,609
it's like the the Super Zelda game that

1024
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:56,349
starts you with all of the items and I

1025
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:57,579
actually kind of was bummed out about

1026
00:35:57,579 --> 00:35:59,710
that it's not fun they took all of the

1027
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,020
the fun discovery had of Zelda so there

1028
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,819
was the original what an original

1029
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,319
released it wasn't that version did they

1030
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:07,839
update it to that version I'm not sure

1031
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,130
whenever I clicked on it about a week

1032
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,869
and a half ago that's the version I had

1033
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,599
the easy one I think I think the old I

1034
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,799
think the older versions I think you

1035
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:15,910
still have the option to playing the old

1036
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,190
version cuz I probably do I put a little

1037
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,630
bit of time in the balloon fight which

1038
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,280
was weird cuz I'd never played that game

1039
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,530
and I surprised I missed it back in the

1040
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,930
day back when I was a baby

1041
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,549
were you guys were a you know a twinkle

1042
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,470
in your daddy's eye but so there's only

1043
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,690
like 30 games on there now and a lot of

1044
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,770
them I'm not particularly good and

1045
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,410
there's a lot missing yeah but there is

1046
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,089
a lot missing that's that's true but I

1047
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,980
mean it's kind of the industry standards

1048
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,230
on consoles to pay for the online

1049
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,069
service

1050
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:45,430
it sucks I'm not happy about it but I

1051
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,470
haven't paid for it yet it is definitely

1052
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,329
a cheaper price because I pay for Xbox

1053
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,950
Live and that's 50 bucks a year 60 bucks

1054
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,450
here played for PlayStation that's 50 or

1055
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,880
60 bucks a year I do pay for Xbox game

1056
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,440
pass which I think was a very smart

1057
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,910
investment one of the best investments

1058
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,660
you can make

1059
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,549
not for PC but for Xbox I think is one

1060
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,440
of the best investments it's there's

1061
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,000
there's talks of it coming to PC yeah

1062
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,890
there is there is a version of Appy on

1063
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,420
PC there's just no games under it right

1064
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,779
now that is like five games and I think

1065
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,190
if you have the Xbox version you also

1066
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,599
have the PC version if I remember

1067
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,279
correctly because I think I could have

1068
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:17,140
played see if these for free somehow but

1069
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,420
I ended this buying C or no I ended up I

1070
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,460
think I did I think I did actually play

1071
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,700
C's for free via the PC version yeah

1072
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,980
what do you mean I paid real money

1073
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,200
dollars for it they're they're really

1074
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,349
apprehensive to put the halo games on

1075
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,819
there I think the father did a halo 5

1076
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,440
wonder if halo hold with it cuz they

1077
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,730
have made the decision to put all of

1078
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,369
their exclusives into the game past ISM

1079
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:41,210
if you own an Xbox and you don't

1080
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,970
game paths you might be making a huge

1081
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,770
mistake because the amount of money you

1082
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,360
will save compared to buying those games

1083
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,040
yeah there's even just one game on there

1084
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,510
you want to play instead of buying that

1085
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,920
game for twenty you spend ten and play

1086
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,290
it throughout the month yeah I think is

1087
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,220
one of the best investments you can make

1088
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,790
anyway

1089
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,970
it's quite good so Nintendo's is $25 a

1090
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,060
years at $20 20 it is $20 a year and if

1091
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,280
there's a there is a family bundle that

1092
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,780
makes it even cheaper than that but you

1093
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,940
need to have like a minimum of six or

1094
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,710
eight accounts I can't remember but if

1095
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,090
you have a friend group and you can

1096
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,340
arrange it so that one person pays you

1097
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,240
can make it like $15 for the year which

1098
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,930
I thought it was four bucks a month it

1099
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,180
is five dollars a month or you can pay

1100
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,960
the yearly amount ah okay got it

1101
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,820
and that's definitely where I go and I'm

1102
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,920
glad I guess I'm glad we got some sort

1103
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,470
of emulation I'm glad we got some you

1104
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,660
know yeah absolutely yeah it's better

1105
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,490
that's better than nothing I was hoping

1106
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,960
a lot more game so I guess they're

1107
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,600
adding more every month so if you if you

1108
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,890
told me right now that I could pay

1109
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,200
twenty dollars to be able to play dr.

1110
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,710
Mario and Metroid for the year on my

1111
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,260
switch I'd probably do that yeah just

1112
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,220
for that right sure

1113
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,770
so it's way cheaper than I thought when

1114
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,630
I got the prompt to pay for it I was

1115
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,610
like four bucks a month most of the

1116
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,470
games that I play on my switch aren't

1117
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,010
online they're all like JRPGs and shit

1118
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,260
like that like Disgaea so I have no need

1119
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,210
for it so I kind of elected not to but

1120
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,530
twenty bucks a month if I'm gonna get

1121
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,940
all that emulation that actually sounds

1122
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,830
like a really good deal well it's

1123
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,940
interesting because it's one of the very

1124
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,560
few times Nintendo seem to listen

1125
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,850
because that's what everybody asked for

1126
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,860
and after that just either it was

1127
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,690
organically an idea somebody had and

1128
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,130
over there in Japan or they listen to

1129
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,960
the audience either way that's another

1130
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,250
that's another thing I want to talk

1131
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,720
about we didn't have some of the list of

1132
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,130
things we're gonna talk about you guys

1133
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,740
heard about PlayStation another thing

1134
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm a little mad at PlayStation about

1135
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,350
right now they're starting to censor

1136
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,710
games yeah I've heard a little bit about

1137
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,380
those so for the longest time you

1138
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,150
mentioned JRPGs and this is what brings

1139
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,800
it in mind for the longest time if you

1140
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,870
wanted to play a nice sexy JRPG

1141
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,580
PlayStation was the place to go not the

1142
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,080
case anymore they are starting to

1143
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,480
severely censor some of the games coming

1144
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,220
over

1145
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,670
I don't have any exact examples but what

1146
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,440
have you heard about this Jakob

1147
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,900
mostly what you just said most of the

1148
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,060
censorship that I know about comes from

1149
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,640
basically China's got some pretty strict

1150
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,060
censorship laws so games if they want to

1151
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,060
appeal to that market have to match what

1152
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,680
they care about in terms of like art

1153
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,480
assets so they can't show

1154
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,840
I think it's bones or like skeletons you

1155
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,849
can't have anybody smoking and so on

1156
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:24,070
they have some pretty stringent things

1157
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,750
that I think Jacob you were telling me

1158
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,349
about Ubisoft is doing that with Rainbow

1159
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:31,930
six siege yes so they're their language

1160
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,150
around it is we are going to make sure

1161
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,670
that the client is the same across all

1162
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,250
regions which means all clients will be

1163
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,410
adhering to Chinese law because they are

1164
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,920
the strictest ones mainly just like

1165
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,780
changing background decorations on

1166
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,340
levels and stuff there's a level that

1167
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,560
happens in a bar and there's like a neon

1168
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,330
sign of a woman dancing on a stripper

1169
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,830
pole and that changed to like just like

1170
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,109
a hand kind of making a gesture and

1171
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:59,700
stuff like that so this started when

1172
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,240
senran kagura burst renewal recently got

1173
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,710
delayed on the PlayStation 4 as the

1174
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,770
platform holder asked publisher XSEED to

1175
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,450
remove a controversial mode which

1176
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,190
effectively allows you to fondle its

1177
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,380
cast of questionably h virtual

1178
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,839
characters against their will some felt

1179
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,940
that given cultural context in 2018 the

1180
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,380
manufacturer had made the right decision

1181
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,330
while others argued that they'd make up

1182
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,859
their own mind about the games they play

1183
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,070
so yeah I'm pretty questionably ages is

1184
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,260
it just right here this is going on in

1185
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,280
other games

1186
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,660
there's also chatter that the

1187
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,310
PlayStation maker has requested jiggle

1188
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,230
jiggle physics be removed for the

1189
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,920
PlayStation version 4 of Warriors Orochi

1190
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,740
4 as they Perez they're presented in the

1191
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,180
Nintendo switch released there's still

1192
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,950
jiggle physics in the Nintendo version

1193
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,500
of the game but playstation wants it

1194
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,660
removed from their version what a time

1195
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,869
you'd be alive if ya endo it doesn't

1196
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:54,540
give a shit about titty jiggles

1197
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,619
playstation does looking at an article

1198
00:41:56,619 --> 00:42:00,030
right now for Dead or Alive Xtreme 3

1199
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,290
Scarlett which I don't know if you know

1200
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,820
what that game is but it is a spin-off

1201
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,890
of the fighting franchise with sexy

1202
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,840
ladies where they get in a

1203
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,360
wearing tiny bikinis to remove two

1204
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,860
questionable items is all it says I'm

1205
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,750
not sure what they are in the

1206
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,770
PlayStation 4 game

1207
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,290
they're staying into the switch game

1208
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,660
that's really I remember something I

1209
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,900
read about that character she's meant to

1210
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,910
appear to be fairly young even though

1211
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,790
I'm sure she's above age which

1212
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,700
characters at Scarlett do a Scarlett I'm

1213
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,440
gonna Google Dead or Alive Xtreme three

1214
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Scarlett just look for Xtreme 3 you'll

1215
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,750
feel funny yeah yeah so let's see so I

1216
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,750
guess I guess seems to be a younger

1217
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,970
looking character and maybe that's part

1218
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,920
of the choice to make localization

1219
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,920
issues yeah I'm not sure but it looks

1220
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,780
like Dead or Alive 6 and Katherine full

1221
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,170
body edition both are affected it's it's

1222
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,730
interesting to see PlayStation move in

1223
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,410
that direction you know because after

1224
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,090
the longest time PlayStation was just

1225
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:05,140
the place to go when if you wanted your

1226
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,080
JRPG games to be uncensored do you guys

1227
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,490
remember this guy's Jin Goomba you

1228
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,360
remember he came over to our house a

1229
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,950
couple times you remember yeah I

1230
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,260
remember PlayStation game over that

1231
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,240
allows you to like squirt your love on

1232
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,510
school girls and it's no I don't

1233
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,800
remember that what was the name of that

1234
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,580
game a gal gun gun that's the one yep

1235
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,920
gal gone extreme to squirt your love

1236
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,750
yeah what I mean but that's the system

1237
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,020
that got published on and now a problem

1238
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,240
with that game existing it's fine

1239
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,520
I'm never gonna buy that game right they

1240
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,350
make me horribly uncomfortable honestly

1241
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,510
it makes me uncomfortable but I can just

1242
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,730
not buy it and like I don't have to

1243
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,650
interact with that that's fine I don't

1244
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,560
know if I want a company making that

1245
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,440
decision for me right which is again it

1246
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,910
goes back to what we were talking about

1247
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,100
with red dead redemption 2 and the

1248
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,990
controversy surrounding that game I feel

1249
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,060
exactly kind of the same way about red

1250
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,940
dead - there's parts of Red Dead -

1251
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,680
certainly parts of Grand Theft Auto that

1252
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,570
made me feel horribly horribly

1253
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,360
uncomfortable these games are definitely

1254
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,040
pushing the edge of the envelope of what

1255
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,050
I feel comfortable with specifically

1256
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,350
when it comes to the violence but I

1257
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,490
don't want a company making a choice for

1258
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,200
me I want to make that choice yeah I

1259
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,609
want to make that choice

1260
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,619
and if somebody out there wants to play

1261
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,480
right Dead Redemption too and they want

1262
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,279
to feed some dude to a crocodile and

1263
00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:28,900
watch them getting slowly mangled er you

1264
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,309
know whatever

1265
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:32,289
yep that's cool that's fine on me that's

1266
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:33,609
fine they can do that

1267
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:36,609
I've no I played 27 hours of Red Dead

1268
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:37,720
Redemption I still haven't fed anything

1269
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,989
to a crocodile so and no eye shadow oh I

1270
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:49,869
shot a crowd of nos I saw it oh my

1271
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:52,420
rockstar why you think that was bad so

1272
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,019
um

1273
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:55,359
once again I killed another dog this is

1274
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,299
in private time but I'm playing I'm

1275
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,220
private time dog killings yeah playing

1276
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,499
red dead and there's a bunch of man I go

1277
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:07,359
into this cabin and I looting it and the

1278
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,920
people who own a cabin are dead they

1279
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,710
just died of the dinner table and so I

1280
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,230
hear voices and I see red on my mini-map

1281
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,359
and it's bounty hunters and I'm like oh

1282
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,119
I'll just try to hide in this building

1283
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,239
let's see if that works so sure enough

1284
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,539
it worked until the dog came bursting

1285
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:31,509
through the front door and some like cuz

1286
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,160
the dog is barking and one of the guys

1287
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,049
goes hey is there someone there oh my

1288
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:38,410
god but so I'm like I'll ignore this dog

1289
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,160
I do not want to kill a dog so I stay in

1290
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,410
there let the dog bite me for a second

1291
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,299
realize this dog is going to kill me if

1292
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:48,339
I don't run so I decide to try to run

1293
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:50,289
now they start shooting me with bullets

1294
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,059
over and over and over again my horse is

1295
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,190
a little ways away so I decide to just

1296
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,769
start opening fire on these bounty

1297
00:45:56,769 --> 00:45:58,119
hunters there's only six of them and

1298
00:45:58,119 --> 00:45:59,529
I've got a bunch of potions so I'm gonna

1299
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:01,210
be fine or health tonics or whatever

1300
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,759
that's like their operations so I just

1301
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,910
start firing away pop pop pop mixes I

1302
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,849
get three of them in the head with my

1303
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,440
with my dead I write off the bastards

1304
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,599
now there's only three left and then the

1305
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,700
dogs are still there and they're

1306
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,470
attacking me and I don't know what I'm

1307
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,049
supposed to do some like I'll shoot the

1308
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:21,970
dogs I have to it's just has to happen

1309
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,789
now yourself so shoot the first dog and

1310
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,890
then I shoot the second dog and then I

1311
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,910
go the first dog didn't die he's just on

1312
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,430
the ground whimpering

1313
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:38,230
why Rockstar why do you make me it felt

1314
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,530
so bad so at that point I'm like I guess

1315
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,400
I have to put him down

1316
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,920
right because he's gonna die one way or

1317
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,540
the other I gotta do it I gotta do the

1318
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,059
right thing but the game is so real in

1319
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,160
my mind and that dog whimpering is so

1320
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,859
real I feel guilty about making the

1321
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:55,359
decision to do it so I pull off the

1322
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,089
pistol I finished the dog off and then I

1323
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:00,339
clogged out of the game cuz I felt so

1324
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,829
yeah it's not even enjoyable right now I

1325
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:05,170
don't wanna like I want to enjoy killing

1326
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,180
those bounty hunters I wanted you know I

1327
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,119
was playing the game behind go seek and

1328
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,559
uh you know and then I just wouldn't

1329
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:12,910
picked up Sammy and I gave him an extra

1330
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,160
treat and I loved all good I'll watch it

1331
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,460
like Netflix but like what along along

1332
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,069
the same lines in in the Pokemon let's

1333
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:23,920
go games there's a new dialogue thing

1334
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,010
for whenever your main Pokemon Eevee or

1335
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,920
Pikachu gets quite hurt and it says it

1336
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,349
looks like your V's in a pinch it looks

1337
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,869
like it might cry I saw though that's

1338
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:37,300
not okay you can't do that to me

1339
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,950
Nintendo what the fuck man

1340
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,720
you can't make this actually like

1341
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,000
dogfighting because now I'm not okay

1342
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,579
with it I feel bad now but till now I

1343
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:47,020
thought they were all having bullet my

1344
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,819
Eevee was poisoned and I was just going

1345
00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:50,079
to ignore it til the end of the fight

1346
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,700
and then unlike the second round of

1347
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,430
battle of that fight my Eevee cured its

1348
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,250
own poison and the game said it did it

1349
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,390
because it didn't want you to worry

1350
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,150
about you worry about it I'm like oh my

1351
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,520
god this is like how realistic you know

1352
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,130
you're making me love my Pokemon which

1353
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,079
is weird cuz normally it's just dog

1354
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,849
fighting like I'm Michael Vick I guess I

1355
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,319
don't know you know I feel everything

1356
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:14,950
else aside in that game it is impossibly

1357
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,280
charming yep as soon as I picked it up I

1358
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,500
I'm just smiling the whole time even

1359
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,000
with the shortcomings that we talked

1360
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,359
about it's so adorable and so what I

1361
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,230
think it teaches us Blizzard what I

1362
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,540
think it teaches us yeah buddy

1363
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,339
duh what it teaches us is it's okay that

1364
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:39,250
it's not a mainline game if it is cute

1365
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,430
if it is fun if it is good that's what

1366
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,930
we're upset about a lot of people are

1367
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,520
saying you're upset the Diablo mortals

1368
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,330
not a not mine

1369
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,980
and there is part of that and there are

1370
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,740
people out there who field that way but

1371
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,380
if it's good if it's fun if it's

1372
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,580
well-rounded if you don't

1373
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,350
microtransaction the living hell out of

1374
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:56,740
it

1375
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,980
then we don't mind so much if fallout 76

1376
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,360
had got put in on the backburner

1377
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,850
if Diablo was coming Diablo immortal was

1378
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,260
coming to peace scene and wasn't filled

1379
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,940
with microtransactions it wasn't a

1380
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,430
free-to-play piece of crap if it was

1381
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,320
somewhere like this Pokemon game is

1382
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,810
which is still has things to appeal to

1383
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,520
the casual crowd has things to pill to

1384
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,360
the mainline crowd we all went into that

1385
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,160
game hoping to maybe hate it a little

1386
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,600
bit I went into it hoping to hate it I

1387
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,130
play I watch to get played at e3 and I'm

1388
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,990
like I hate this game is dumb this is

1389
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,690
gonna be terrible and I always I fell in

1390
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,330
love because it's good please do that to

1391
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,400
us please do that doesn't just make your

1392
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,230
games good and it doesn't matter that

1393
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,550
it's hardcore doesn't matter that's

1394
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,930
mainline it doesn't matter

1395
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,430
there'll always be holdouts who are

1396
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,560
pissed you can't help those people right

1397
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,150
there's plenty of Pokemon fans right now

1398
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,490
who are bombarding the Pokemon let's go

1399
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,340
use your feedback on on Metacritic this

1400
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,870
game is not a mainline game it doesn't

1401
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,340
have all the mechanics they took stuff

1402
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,650
out of it I burnt umber tomorrow those

1403
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,240
people are gonna exist but there are

1404
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,070
plenty people like us who are cheating

1405
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,570
themselves right like they're missing

1406
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,730
out on an enjoyable experience because I

1407
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,480
don't expect it to be exactly them and

1408
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,580
guarantee is a mainline game somewhere

1409
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,680
along the lines to which they happen

1410
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,180
right exactly which is what they did

1411
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,280
successful where was the fallout or what

1412
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,170
was the the next fallout announcement

1413
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,190
right where's the next Skyrim

1414
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,740
announcement or something well I mean we

1415
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,020
kind of had those but we're far far

1416
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,700
what's the right and where the hell's

1417
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,200
the Diablo announcement if you guys are

1418
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,700
working on Diablo for Easter bring us

1419
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,040
something bring us something I mean show

1420
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,670
us a JPEG with a song a you know on the

1421
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,830
main stage that's apparently that works

1422
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,480
that's fine they're like hey elder

1423
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,400
school students 40 years in the future

1424
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,740
here's a JPEG and there's been a lot of

1425
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,090
interviews and stuff following up the

1426
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,040
Diablo immortal thing of like developers

1427
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,870
who are like a banding ship over there

1428
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,430
Blizzard and are just like frustrated

1429
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,740
the company and like apparently they did

1430
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,300
away with like Christmas bonuses this

1431
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,490
year so there's no bonus like some all

1432
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,530
kinds of really shady crazy stuff

1433
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:54,970
blizzards just not the company that it

1434
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,980
used to be which is a real shame and I

1435
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,800
guess I guess you know totalbiscuit who

1436
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,190
is

1437
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,440
was a huge blizzard fan his entire life

1438
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,349
was very hesitant to to openly criticize

1439
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:07,030
as much as he normally would about

1440
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,940
Activision making the purchase but um he

1441
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,130
was still willing to say it you know yes

1442
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,450
friends of the company's just like man I

1443
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,440
don't know this is the right decision

1444
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,240
and you know John didn't live to see the

1445
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,950
state of things that Blizzard is become

1446
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,510
boy but I'm glad there are people out

1447
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,890
there complaining instead because I know

1448
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,260
he would be livid

1449
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,990
livid to see that comedy do what it's

1450
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,400
been doing what other we'll talk about

1451
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,130
lighter note yeah and speaking of like

1452
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,660
making games fun can we talk about

1453
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,119
artifact for a minute yeah so that was a

1454
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,609
weird controversy that lasted for hours

1455
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:41,819
so those who are not paying attention

1456
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,410
artifact is a brand new game based on

1457
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,710
dota Defense of the Ancients run by the

1458
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,970
folks over there at Steam it's the first

1459
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,990
game that the folks at steams it's just

1460
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,400
a quick little correction it is actually

1461
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,040
called DOTA DOTA is it yeah it is not

1462
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,530
called DOTA because someone else owns

1463
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,170
that oh that's interesting so DOTA valve

1464
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:10,660
owns the term DOTA as a word don't as a

1465
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,619
word DOTA DOTA - okay owned by someone

1466
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:16,329
else so the guy who made magic the

1467
00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:18,250
gathering richard garfield got hired by

1468
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,810
them to make their card game for them

1469
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,000
and this game is complex and convoluted

1470
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,430
and weird and i can't wait to play it

1471
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,589
it's like three boards at once yeah it's

1472
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:28,720
really complicated I'm excited I'm

1473
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,030
excited it go at the gameplay I will

1474
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,619
never stream it because the idea of

1475
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:34,390
someone trying to watch that game if

1476
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,650
they don't know much about it is

1477
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:36,970
impossible and if you do know a lot

1478
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,250
about it it's still hard to watch yeah I

1479
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,050
that can only imagine right so as an

1480
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,460
eSport this is dead in the water right

1481
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,630
off the bat I don't know what they were

1482
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,880
trying to do I don't know maybe they've

1483
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,160
got a really weird system for that

1484
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,079
because there isn't a ladder to grind

1485
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,910
which is what we're kind of used to in

1486
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,560
all of these collectible digital card

1487
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,200
games and it seems to be entirely

1488
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,170
tournament focused yeah right which is

1489
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,609
like that's what they want for their

1490
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:02,109
eSports widget should have been more

1491
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:04,300
watchable then because it is a most

1492
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,069
that's one of the most common critiques

1493
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:07,359
I've heared for heard from the pros

1494
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,060
I've heard that too if the game is fun

1495
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,220
that's that's what artifact is built

1496
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,660
around right or so

1497
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,799
all these other things are like well

1498
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:16,720
hearthstone whether it's fun or not it's

1499
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,299
very accessible anybody can get into her

1500
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:22,839
stove right guinta's beautiful magic has

1501
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:26,589
its storied history artifact all of its

1502
00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:29,079
systems are based around yeah but the

1503
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:30,940
game is fun to play there's no ladder to

1504
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,410
keep you coming back there's not really

1505
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,900
any way to go infinite in terms of like

1506
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,240
a free to play method you're gonna have

1507
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,640
to spend money on the game and so that

1508
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,750
was that was one of the biggest

1509
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,609
controversies it's been originally when

1510
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:43,930
they announced the game and the beta

1511
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,839
lifted like the the NDA is lifted people

1512
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:48,940
explain the the the pay-for system and

1513
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,859
apparently you could barely do anything

1514
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:52,809
for free your initial $20 bought you

1515
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:53,980
some cards for those cards were not

1516
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,210
guaranteed to be any good there are so

1517
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:56,770
just some really crappy cards in the

1518
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,990
game one at the rear slot right I can I

1519
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,640
can go ahead and I have a breakdown of

1520
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,710
what everything costs in the game right

1521
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,240
now but as of the announcement are as to

1522
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,099
what it cost now because I'm out right

1523
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:07,510
now so at the time of the announcement

1524
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,309
it's very important people you guys that

1525
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:11,619
are saying people are very upset that

1526
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:13,450
there's basically nothing you could do

1527
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,460
for free even with your original $20

1528
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,319
investment to play in almost anything to

1529
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:19,420
draft cost money to play constructed

1530
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,760
cost money it cost event tickets to do

1531
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,799
anything if you wanted to play with the

1532
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,390
cards you already bought you still had

1533
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,339
to spend money on some form so with this

1534
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:29,980
no longer the within four hours of that

1535
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,680
announcement steam back rolled that and

1536
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,690
now what's the situation Jacob okay so

1537
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,569
it is still a $20 buy-in you get two

1538
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:39,880
starter decks that have reasonably good

1539
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,710
cards as well as ten boosters I think

1540
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,720
ten boosters which have 12 cards apiece

1541
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,579
which you're not guaranteed to get

1542
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:50,799
amazing cards but you might one rare

1543
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,990
you're guaranteed one rare but who knows

1544
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,059
I mean like magic hearthstone all of

1545
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,309
those games have duds in those slots as

1546
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:59,829
well I'm at least there is no like

1547
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,289
legendary or mythic it's just rare or

1548
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:04,960
not rare right and then you also get

1549
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,319
five event tickets the boosters for the

1550
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,880
twelve cards cost two dollars apiece and

1551
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,000
a bundle of five event tickets cost five

1552
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,210
dollars so you're you're getting like a

1553
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,950
reasonably good value it's basically

1554
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,500
like they made you buy the introductory

1555
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,270
starter kit that a lot of other games

1556
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:25,150
that are free-to-play offer empty arena

1557
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,710
says here give us five dollars will give

1558
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:27,550
you a slightly

1559
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,080
real ones sorry I don't know if I missed

1560
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,660
it when you said it but um there's all

1561
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,890
supposed to be supposed to be free

1562
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,110
phantom drafts as well yes so right I

1563
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,210
was I was gonna get to that so there are

1564
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,820
free versions of all of the paid

1565
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,850
versions they offer no rewards so you

1566
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,130
can do a small little constructed event

1567
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,140
for free but you won't get any rewards

1568
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,660
you can do a phantom draft either with

1569
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,250
random people online or with your

1570
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,830
friends even but there's no prizes and

1571
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,540
you don't get to keep your cards but

1572
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,620
that's stuff you can do for free for

1573
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,020
practice right yeah have fun and I think

1574
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,580
that's the best way to play the game is

1575
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,810
draft is what I've heard from a lot of

1576
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,450
the pros so doing that for free um

1577
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,950
making me what make you want to invest

1578
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:07,840
in the actual cards so yeah I think it's

1579
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,230
pretty cool and that is steams policy

1580
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,300
really I like Lisa commented on the

1581
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,150
valve bow like a valve once said when

1582
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,860
they were trying paid mods they said

1583
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,750
when you upset the internet uses million

1584
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,400
dollars a day they're ready to reverse

1585
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,050
this within minutes they were ready to

1586
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,430
come up with a compromise within minutes

1587
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,840
that's one of the reasons valve

1588
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,340
continues to be one of my favorite

1589
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,810
companies a company that I love to put

1590
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,070
money and I wish they made more video

1591
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,520
games you know and so the most recent

1592
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,000
controversy was in these packs you can

1593
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,950
open the starter heroes that everybody

1594
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,160
is guaranteed to have right and there

1595
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,460
was no incentive to basically you got

1596
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,470
nothing out of those bad yes it was a

1597
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,170
literal he's an actual dud they're not

1598
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,820
gonna be worth anything everybody has

1599
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,190
those cards and previously there was not

1600
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,260
anything to do with them they are adding

1601
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,300
a way to break down cards basically a

1602
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,060
dusting system room hearthstone but

1603
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,800
because there's no crafting system what

1604
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,600
you're doing is basically trading in a

1605
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,640
collection of cards for event tickets

1606
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,130
right which is I mean that's currently

1607
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,350
yeah that's that is what they've said

1608
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,780
that system should be launching because

1609
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,730
it goes into open beta or release I

1610
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,600
don't actually know what they're calling

1611
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,880
it on November 28th and that system

1612
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,330
should be implemented around that time

1613
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,520
so I have seen on the internet on reddit

1614
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,140
because I've been trying to follow

1615
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,790
artifact a lot recently because it's

1616
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,980
it's coming out on the 28th right that's

1617
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,350
when it gets access to it yeah and like

1618
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,900
it looks exciting to me so much of the

1619
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,670
hate is there's no ladder what's the

1620
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,110
point right well how can I be

1621
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,210
competitive if nobody can see my high

1622
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,359
numbers

1623
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,519
the game should be fun if the game is

1624
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:47,579
fun I'll want to play it yep yeah and it

1625
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,979
if it is fun it's gonna make people

1626
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:54,059
realize how I don't know not fun they're

1627
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:55,739
having playing the other card games that

1628
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,479
they're playing only to grind ladders

1629
00:57:57,479 --> 00:58:02,309
yeah so this actually brings me into a

1630
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:03,329
conscious I want to talk about a

1631
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,749
controversy that happened with this game

1632
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,339
them wants me to lead into another card

1633
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,519
game a little bit of card game talk here

1634
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:13,589
starting off with a card that Valve had

1635
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:14,190
to change

1636
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,650
they created a card called crack the

1637
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:20,849
whip mm-hmm now that in itself is not a

1638
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:22,319
problem for me in my opinion here's

1639
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,299
where the problem came in the text on

1640
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:28,380
this card read modify a black hero with

1641
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,969
after you play a black card give this

1642
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:31,920
hero and its allied neighbors +2 attack

1643
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,650
this round now I think I I think I'm

1644
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:38,880
glad that they've changed the name of

1645
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,019
this and I'm one of those people who are

1646
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,400
always like hey call a card wherever you

1647
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,229
want do whatever you want to do play it

1648
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:45,029
however you want to play it crack the

1649
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:47,339
whip by itself was not a problem I think

1650
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:50,279
once we realized what the card did sure

1651
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:52,619
no it was easy to draw parallel right

1652
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,509
maybe that was a little too on the nose

1653
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:56,910
I mean it was probably an unintended

1654
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,479
thing right different design mechanics

1655
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,979
for for the different colors of the

1656
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:05,099
cards and that just sort of slipped

1657
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:06,839
through nobody noticed the connotations

1658
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:08,369
that it would have and their response to

1659
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:09,809
it was oh yeah you're right we'll change

1660
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:12,539
it right which is great and I know a lot

1661
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:13,890
of people were mad at artifact for

1662
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,180
making that decision I think it was the

1663
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,069
right decision now a company that I'm

1664
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:18,719
not so sure I agree with there's another

1665
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:20,549
card game that just came out called key

1666
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:21,900
Forge once again Richard Garfield

1667
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,459
designed this one as well and what's

1668
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,140
really interesting about key Forge is

1669
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,959
you buy a starter deck and then that

1670
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:30,449
starter deck has to stay together and

1671
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:34,319
you get a randomly designed deck that is

1672
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,839
computer generated and there's some

1673
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,789
cards like there's a decks that'll have

1674
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:40,410
the four horsemen um those decks are

1675
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,670
selling for like five six hundred bucks

1676
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,680
you paid $9.99 to get it because people

1677
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,359
are desperate to get the the really

1678
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,670
really good cards now they also had as

1679
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,119
some unfortunate naming as well and the

1680
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,400
cause of that they banned

1681
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,800
those decks not just the cards in those

1682
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,760
decks but the actual decks specifically

1683
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,030
I believe they referred to gypsies which

1684
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:05,010
I guess is a word and I apologize for

1685
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,530
using that word if it's offensive I

1686
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:11,340
presume that it is offensive but that's

1687
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,320
that's interesting that we're at a point

1688
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,500
where you know we're trying to make

1689
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,580
those kinds of changes I don't

1690
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,370
necessarily think they're they are bad

1691
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,390
to want to make those kinds of changes

1692
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,670
I'm looking now there's an article here

1693
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,980
says some unfortunate key forged deck

1694
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,020
names include Titan Flair the farmer of

1695
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,550
racism which is a deck name and general

1696
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:37,560
bone rider cult so it's these are

1697
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,420
procedurally generated before right and

1698
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,730
so wouldn't you buy a key Forge deck

1699
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:46,530
though you're guaranteed to get a unique

1700
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:54,560
deck with a unique name Titan Flair yeah

1701
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,530
I mean for some reason that word racism

1702
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,960
was within the pool of words that it

1703
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,960
could pool pull from for some like it's

1704
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,860
beyond me why they would've algorithm

1705
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:11,190
it's that it's it's yeah yeah

1706
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:14,610
Jona general bone writer cult that was

1707
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:18,780
rose water like a neural net made here's

1708
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,450
the other one the villain that digs up

1709
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:25,950
porridge oh yeah that guy right I'm into

1710
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:28,380
that one that was good it sounds like

1711
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,940
they came up with a good system and then

1712
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,830
they put some words and cliff Minh the

1713
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:40,320
Oregon scholar of the forest reg atholl

1714
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:46,590
fjord a sophomore this survivor the

1715
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:51,720
survivor who grimaces at politics plays

1716
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,120
politics in their pool yeah they

1717
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,040
definitely see words like that or are

1718
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,100
clearly like oh this is good make

1719
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,290
something bad in the future we should

1720
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:04,599
know better than this yeah you should

1721
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:06,969
so a lot of people are calling key Forge

1722
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:08,949
the next coming of Magic the Gathering a

1723
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:10,029
lot of people are investing a lot of

1724
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:12,279
money in that game I don't think I don't

1725
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:16,959
oh my god oh my god screen you're not

1726
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:23,199
gonna believe this one oh my god

1727
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:25,119
I don't think this game is gonna be as

1728
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,890
famous as people think it's gonna be but

1729
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,589
stuff like this sure will push it to to

1730
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:31,779
mass media discussion which may be why

1731
01:02:31,779 --> 01:02:34,390
they did it maybe I haven't played this

1732
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:35,679
game yet so I don't know if it's good or

1733
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:37,660
not here it is it's on screen right now

1734
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,890
I'll read it out loud for those who

1735
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,189
can't see it this is the Emperor that

1736
01:02:42,189 --> 01:02:55,359
pays for boys what the hell whoa hold on

1737
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,099
I don't think she made that decision

1738
01:02:57,099 --> 01:02:59,679
that was I don't think a human made that

1739
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,199
decision right no a robot definitely

1740
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,329
made that decision but human made the

1741
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:08,609
decision to allow the word boys yes that

1742
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:12,279
booth was it was a mistake right you

1743
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:15,489
have allowed the word boys it's funny

1744
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:17,439
word it's kind of interesting comment

1745
01:03:17,439 --> 01:03:19,269

01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:26,019
you were talking about that laughs no I

1770
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:27,729
don't know nothing about no key for jizz

1771
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:30,309
I bought us a starter kit so okay if

1772
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:33,069
it's cool I'll buy a box of starters you

1773
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,959
know still available like Amazon and

1774
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:38,619
stuff digital card game is it it's a

1775
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:39,759
card game and I wish it was digital

1776
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:42,099
that'd be way more interesting well then

1777
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:43,209
you could just like fix the whole

1778
01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:45,009
problem with their word pool Yeah right

1779
01:04:45,009 --> 01:04:47,199
yeah usually but now you're already on

1780
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:48,880
paper but if you think about it I mean

1781
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,339
if this game did catch on like magic did

1782
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:52,929
any it won't cuz nothing will ever catch

1783
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:55,089
on like magic did but if it did catch on

1784
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:58,959
like magic and you you got the deck and

1785
01:04:58,959 --> 01:05:01,539
you got a card named you know the

1786
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:03,369
Emperor that gave porridge for boys or

1787
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:06,880
whatever you get some insane deck right

1788
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,419
can never exist you know boy politics

1789
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:16,419
and McGillicutty you know slam right

1790
01:05:16,419 --> 01:05:19,959
like if you get that that's that's the

1791
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:22,209
Alpha that's the that's the Black Lotus

1792
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:26,469
alpha most of their key force cards you

1793
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:28,479
can show up to a tournament a legacy

1794
01:05:28,479 --> 01:05:29,979
tournament 20 years from now and sit

1795
01:05:29,979 --> 01:05:32,140

1796
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,279

1797
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:39,219
just win all night get the four horsemen

1798
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:40,989
in your deck all right well I will talk

1799
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:42,429
about the key for a little bit more next

1800
01:05:42,429 --> 01:05:43,630
time one of the times you got for us

1801
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,599
Jacob so uh let's talk a little bit

1802
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,179
about hitman two the first elusive

1803
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,309
target which if you're not familiar if

1804
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:53,019
you haven't played as an elusive target

1805
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:56,259
so the way elusive targets work in

1806
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:59,650
hitman is they are limited time targets

1807
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,749
that you have to kill and they will show

1808
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:05,799
up for a weekend or maybe a couple of

1809
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:08,739
weeks and you get one shot at killing

1810
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,319
them if you fail the mission or if you

1811
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:14,650
die that's it you go you yeah you get

1812
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:17,950
one shot at doing it they have had

1813
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:20,890
liberté guests previously but the first

1814
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:24,849
elusive target for hitman 2 is Sean Bean

1815
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:28,780
he is appearing is he Sean Bean as Sean

1816
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,109
Bean or Sean Bean Ezequiel ok he is

1817
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:35,079
playing a character named Mark faba who

1818
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:38,079
has earned the reputation as impossible

1819
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,099
to kill now if you know anything about

1820
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:45,369
Sean beam every character he plays is

1821
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,710
the exact opposite of that he dies in

1822
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,570
every movie he dies in every single

1823
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,060
movie so the characters even earned the

1824
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,890
nickname the undying for the number of

1825
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,500
times he's escaped assassinations by

1826
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,270
faking his own death and now you as a

1827
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,730
way to go are charged with setting up an

1828
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:06,609
elaborate plan to get him to actually

1829
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:09,099
die this time and you get one row you

1830
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:11,140
have one shot at it otherwise he gets

1831
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,560
away and wait um another story in his

1832
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,010
legend of the undying do you get

1833
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,810
anything for killing the target like

1834
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,670
anything special unique or just bragging

1835
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,430
rights of like no I killed Sean I think

1836
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,079
it's bragging rights I'm actually not a

1837
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,940
hundred percent sure what you get I

1838
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,680
haven't I'm gonna admit something to you

1839
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,760
guys right now I've never actually

1840
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,640
killed any of the elusive targets I've

1841
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,220
tried several and I failed all or shame

1842
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,410
man it's ok I'm not good at that game

1843
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,900
but it's whatever I couldn't really get

1844
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,810
into I couldn't really get into ya man

1845
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,390
game so you don't really like stealth

1846
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:49,319
games yeah you don't like puzzle games

1847
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:50,589
ok

1848
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:52,180
I like stealth games that let me just

1849
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:57,760
brute force them so this game you kind

1850
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,490
of can you can some levels Gears of War

1851
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:04,060
style like cape guns some people down

1852
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,740
move over pick up their guns cuz you do

1853
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,780
you will run out of ammo you can't like

1854
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,790
kill a couple hundred people in a level

1855
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,130
and still make it out I like right

1856
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,270
that's what I like about like stealth

1857
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,369
would in a stealth game they're like I

1858
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:17,440
try to stealth and then I screw up and

1859
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,910
then the game's not over I get to

1860
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:21,069
continue to try that's what I like and

1861
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,180
it's just murder everybody from that

1862
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,410
point forward right there

1863
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:26,109
you definitely can't do it man right and

1864
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:27,819
like just finish the level killing

1865
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:30,489
everybody but you get less points they

1866
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:31,790
definitely want you to

1867
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,950
do challenges there's a challenge in

1868
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,230
every level called silent assassin

1869
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,210
sorry pointed out in chat that I am bad

1870
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,010
at all video games of course I hate that

1871
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:42,410
hate because it requires some patience

1872
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,620
and technical expertise yeah well you

1873
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,150
just don't derive joy from those kinds

1874
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:50,480
of things without shaming you for it no

1875
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,150
it's how are you Mike

1876
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:56,540
Jacob shaming you okay that's fine you

1877
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,580
haven't killed an elusive target yeah so

1878
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,080
people who don't I get like a unique

1879
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,690
title or unique something like I'm not

1880

1882
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,750
ya know so the first elusive target and

1883
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:18,350
hit man 2 is Sean Bean that makes me

1884
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:21,049
want to buy the game just for that uh if

1885
01:09:21,049 --> 01:09:23,480
you buy hit Miam - it comes with hitman

1886

1888
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,799

1889
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:35,839
fight about a hitman one on deep

1890
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,200
discounts that I'm not sure I haven't

1891
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,650
checked into that ya know that that

1892
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,810
that's got me excited about playing some

1893
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,120
more hitman I like the elusive targets

1894
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,160
and I guess we're talking about games

1895
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,870
that have come out let's talk about

1896
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,700
battlefield fire for a second nobody

1897
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,520
here has played it right no and I have

1898
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,620
not seen a single battlefield game oh

1899
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,870
that's so battlefield one was incredible

1900
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:01,910
our axe I accidentally called for all

1901
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,730
the time but battlefield 5 is now

1902
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,400
officially out and with 41 critics

1903
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,680
weighing in it's actually sitting in an

1904
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,650
81 uh-huh and a lot of people have said

1905
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,030
a lot of the controversial like

1906
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:15,430
controversial stuff they were pushing

1907
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,810
they said like a lot of it's not as bad

1908
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,880
now this is a game that I will warn you

1909
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,950
I feel like maybe got skewed a little

1910
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,450
bit the cause of the controversy I think

1911
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:24,530
critics may be weighing it a little

1912
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,420
higher than usual user scores like three

1913
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,920
point six so the users are still really

1914
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,780
mad but I don't care too much about user

1915
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,320
score but that said it is an incomplete

1916
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,550
game because they have a battle royale

1917
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,080
mode that's not out yet the co-op mode

1918
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,970
is not out yet those things are coming

1919
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,160
out in 2019 so if you buy the game now

1920
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,320
know you're buying an incomplete version

1921
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,160
of the game

1922
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,840
and it had one of the worst release

1923
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,340
schedules of all time because he bought

1924
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,380
these super super digital deluxe I

1925
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,460
forget what they call the ultimate

1926
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:51,150
version

1927
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:52,920
you got to play a little bit early and

1928
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,810
then if you bought the next tier now and

1929
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,760
you got to play a little bit earlier and

1930
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,440
then if you bought the standard version

1931
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,940
of the game the $60 version of the game

1932
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,260
you basically had to wait a full week

1933
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,770
before you could start playing so EAB

1934
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:09,180
MEA over there EA and up every game they

1935
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:11,400
play but it looks like the game is not

1936
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,530
as bad as people had anticipated that

1937
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,630
that it would be and it does still have

1938
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,430
a single-player campaign um

1939
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,870
which some people have said has been

1940
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:20,880
very interesting to play so I probably

1941
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,200
will pick it at some point for the

1942
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,530
single-player yeah I can't be excited

1943
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:28,020
for a game that isn't as bad as people

1944
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,480
thought it would be right right I hate

1945
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,270
you compared to the battlefield 1 on

1946
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,060
Metacritic its overall score ended up at

1947
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:39,870
I think it's in the 90s it's having

1948
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,900
trouble loading it right now camera is

1949
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,570
frozen your cam froze yay well I've been

1950
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,460
having all kinds of problems with my

1951
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:52,580
computer so I am not real surprised well

1952
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,870
any other topics we absolutely have to

1953
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,640
talk about before we all know that my

1954
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,180
camera has died their keep yeah yeah we

1955

1957
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,130

1958
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,150
people that you have for the people

1959
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,320
watching ever the people in the comments

think I think Ellis has one this week so

1962
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,960
recently swords have become open-carry

1963
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,860
in Texas you can carry a sword around

1964
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,810
legally in Texas as long as you're not

1965
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:24,960
concealing it if you stick that sword in

1966
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,600
like a summer sausage does that is that

1967
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,570
considered concealing the sword how much

1968
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,490
of the sword needs to be showing to be

1969
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:36,210
considered not being concealed yes is

1970
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,160
that your question that is my question

1971
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,090
I have a hard time with a summer sausage

1972
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:45,090
with a handle sticking out of it is that

1973
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:47,370
okay well listen I have a hard time

1974
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,200
answering this question because my

1975
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,690
response would be I'm I'm going to just

1976
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:54,900
carry my entire Claymore around showing

1977
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,810
it to everyone yeah because

1978
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,610
I don't want to conceal that sword I

1979
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:00,500
want him to know I have a sword I'm

1980
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,550
going to get a seat in the movies for

1981
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:09,290

1982

1986
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:20,990
Ralph Rex of the internet which they did

1987
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:22,160
not call it that good they called it

1988
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,810
Ralph breaks the Internet wise not Rex

1989
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,820
the Internet pretty good if you guys

1990

1991
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,430
recommend it I think you can wait till

1992
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:34,130
it comes home because it's it's got some

1993
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,690
good moments it's not like a crazy mood

1994
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:36,650
but there's no spoilers or anything

1995
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,690
mm-hmm but I just want to say for those

1996

2000
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,730

film yeah the Toy Story but it doing

2002
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,290
that the trailers for Toy Story 4 were

2003
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:52,790
better than the movie but it was still

2004

01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,560
question for you who made it all the way

2030
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,900
to the end of this podcast let us know

2031
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,480
what you think there is that forum in

2032
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,730
the description section and we are

2033
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,410
looking at a way to monetize we've

2034
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:50,450
talked about sponsors but sponsors can

2035
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,680
be annoying for listeners we've talked

2036
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,890
about patreon specifically for this

2037
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,720
podcast we thought talked about ways to

2038
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,670
make sure that these guys have the rent

2039
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,200
and electricity and water and gas paid

2040
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,520
so they can continue to do what they do

2041
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,350
for a living if you guys want to figure

2042
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:04,250
out a way to support me and always

2043
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,020
support them over there on their twitch

2044
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,500
channel directly for now

2045
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,530
big underscore breakfast but if you want

2046
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,350

2047
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,630
venture let us know what way you'd best

2048
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,740
