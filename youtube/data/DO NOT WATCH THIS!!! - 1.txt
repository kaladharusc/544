don't put it on either channel there

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,030
once was a squirrel who lived

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,629
underground one morning he awoke to a

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,409
loud clanking sound he emerged from his

49
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:41,090
hole and saw a big trap he said no way

50
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,930
I'm done with this crap he scurried off

51
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,500
eagerly looking for food when he found a

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,459
place that soured his mood he checked up

53
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,299
and down he checked left and right but

54
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,650
there was no food anywhere in his sight

55
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,530
he hurried back home to steal the bait

56
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,250
he used his wings so he wouldn't be late

57
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,870
when he arrived he did some arm circles

58
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,849
preparing his body to overcome large

59
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,320
hurdles he crawled to the trap

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,980
with inside he snatched up the bait but

61
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,550
that trapped replied the door slams shut

62
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,030
and our squirrel got trapped but by the

63
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,900
look of it

64
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,850
he had just snapped he wriggled rattled

65
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,860
until he blacked out when he awoke he

66
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,450
was tied up to his snout he was scared

67
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,760
of the creature and what it had planned

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,180
so he begged for forgiveness from the

69
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,130
bad man the bat man said nothing so he

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,940
pleaded with God why is he doing this

71
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,840
why does he need to God responded back

don't normally say that people are

93
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,370
jealous but this was a collection video

94
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,919
and I think a lot of you did end up

95
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,870
getting a little jealous anyway I've

96
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,939
made the decision to never upload a

97
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,129
collections video on this channel ever

98
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,189

104
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,639

smart-home devices don't have I'm not

106
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:08,229
saying her name because I don't want to

107
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,649
wake her out The X Factor the sexy voice

108
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:14,800

109
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
works it just works and that's what I

110
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,389
really respect about Amazon and what

111
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,050
they've done with Alexa I tend to use

112
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,029
Alexa more than the other smart-home

113
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,249
devices but that doesn't make her better

114
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:30,219
that just means that she's smarter for

115
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,680
my daily use they each do their own

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,169

hello everyone my name is Debra you

126
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,490
might recognize me from my work in the

127
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,740
comments section on YouTube I'm a huge

128
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,320
pitbull advocate and I do most of my

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,660
work on pitbull videos specifically

130
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,640
pitbull videos relating to children

131
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,440
because there's a lot of misconception

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,810
about pitbulls I have two pities myself

133
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,170
Kona and Cali and I just want to spread

134
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,000
the word that pitbulls are not killing

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,210
machines vicious dog completely mauls

136
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,360
child's face with kisses

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,150
the only good pit bull is a pit bull

138
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,940
that's licking your face you see the key

139
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,919
is to lead the pit bull haters on make

140
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,990
them think that you agree with their

141
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,300
heinous ways and then flip it on them at

142
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,000
the last second I would never let one of

143

those ferocious things anywhere near my

deer's antler because none of them

159
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,810

166
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,110
warehouse well we can't afford that so

167
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,380
what I got instead was my leftover

168
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,850
Special K red berry rant of cereal we're

169
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,810
just gonna sprinkle that over the top if

170
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,430
you guys aren't making a lot of money on

171
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,440
Adsense you're gonna want to take notes

172
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,680
because these tips are invaluable all

173
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
right guys here we go it's gonna be

174
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:32,260
really fast so don't blink so we ran

175
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,200
into a bit of an issue but that's

176
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,030
completely normal for low-budget slow-mo

177
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:44,560

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,370
come on that didn't do what I wanted it

180
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,940
to do

181
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,970
but that's okay because we shoe more

182
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,380
than one thing here we don't shoot a

183
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,060
single thing we shoot a lot of things

184
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,460
for this slo-mo we're gonna see what

185
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,890
popcorn looks like when it pops in slow

186
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,590
motion and to make it look just a little

187
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,960
fancier I got some craft paint from

188
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,030
Walmart because this is a low-budget

189
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:22,250
channel oh they're going everything sort

190
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,200
of stop popping once I put the paint in

191
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,920
there

192

[Music]

193
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,270
kinda just looks like I'm cooking paint

194
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,880
cutting off the circulation my arm shit

195
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,350
sometimes on this channel we have to

196
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,060
bring in the sledgehammer we got to

197
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,410
bring in something that's gonna wow

198
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,470
people even if the slo-mo sucks I'm

199
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,480
gonna fly this drone at 30 miles an hour

200
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,480
toward my face hopefully this makes for

201
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:05,260
some good slow-mo we got the freakin

202
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,750
shot

203

204
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:24,680
oh wow look at that look stone-faced

206
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,090
you could see the moment and when it

207
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,370
hits me that concludes this episode of

208
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,010
low-budget slow-mo lad remember always

209
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,680
stay within your budget it shouldn't

210
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,210
surprise you that we don't have the

211
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,420
budget for a sound guy so yes we do all

212
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,580
our folly in-house
