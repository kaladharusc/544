00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome back to 'Totally True Documentary'.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,340
Today we're following someone who became a meme to take a look into what happens after their explosive popularity.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:16,440
Hi, my name is Rodney Shelton and a - a lot of you already know who I am, but just in case you, don't i'm the, 'OOH

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,980
THAT'S GOOD!'

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,340
meme guy.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,300
&quot;OOH, that's good!&quot;

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,140
So, uh, how the meme happened is so crazy but,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,290
lemme tell you this story. I wanted to eat this soup but I wasn't sure if it was gonna be too hot

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:39,870
So I had my friend record me just in case I needed to sue the soup maker- it's happened to me in the past - so I did that and the soup

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,940
Was perfect so i just you know i just reacted i just said, OOH!

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,060
That's good!

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:54,780
And the internet just blew up it went viral super fast so I decided to leave wisconsin, along with everything else in my life

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,960
My six-figure engineering job, my wife. I dropped

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,340
my dog in a remote field, I sold my house and I moved to hollywood to pursue a career in show business

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:11,540
And I also brought my friend along who shot the original video. He's my director/producer/manager/writing partner

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
I'm writing an 'OOH! That's good!' movie?

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,369
It's gonna be like the godfather, but instead of gangsters

18
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:23,970
It's soup, oh and we're, also killing the merch game check this out

19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,720
It's supposed to say, ooh that's good but it says god cuz

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,620
We this is the misprint so once we sell out of that then, we'll get the real phrase printed on there

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,300
How many, of these little bad boys, have we sold? Like five

22
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,079
Five thousand shirts

23
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,660
no, just five shirts

24
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,280
I mean maybe it was four. Rodney shares an apartment room with other meme stars that come to LA, seeking lasting fame.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,100
They call this place the memepyre state building, coined that myself.

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,360
There's like 15 other meme legends that all share this unit and it's just a great time. Oh like, this guy maurice

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,840
Hey, what's up internet? Do your meme for them.

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,780
Oh yeah

29
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,740
Oh my god! You're such a legend! Will you guys keep it down?

30
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,410
I'm working on my new caption. That's Sven. He's this ancient meme known

31
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,560
as Scumbag Sven. He comes from those days when people share those cringy motivator memes.

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,920
Yeah, he's one of those. Sorry, Sven. I've just been so tired lately and I just don't

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,780
My arm!

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,920
It is fading! They said this would happen

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,420
when your meme is forgotten you fade from existence!

36
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,940
Damn just like Coco. What? No. This is nothing like Coco

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,300
Yeah, Maurice I am over here like, not understanding the similarities that you

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,280
Gah!

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,700
I can feel myself drifting

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,740
Rodney. Yes Sven? Please

41
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:15,880
Before I go play that song I like and you can have my guitar. Yo, what the f**k this is exactly, like coco

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,140
Remember Meme

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,820
I'm gonna miss Sven. At least our meme has more lasting power than some silly little folk

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,700
Oh!

45
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,440
Oh no!

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,580
No no no

47
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,320
Dude now you're getting Coco too!

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh no it's too soon! How do I stay relevant Maurice? You got to do what I did

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,160
You got to do a song with mean baby girl.

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:50,019
Oh no, mean baby girl is a nine year old youtuber who attracted a large amount of attention for being extremely vulgar and

51
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,100
flaunting her parents wealth. You know, I don't really want to smack talk my fellow peers but the only

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,200
People that would ever collab with mean baby girl are people who have no respect for themselves or their

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,240
fans it's the last thing I would

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,280
Ever do

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,020
Uh!

56
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,360
Mean Baby Girl!

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
And Rodney

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,880
We're here to tell all ya ugly ass haters to shut up!

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,260
or else we'll beat y'alls asses!

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,800
Uh huh!

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,540
OOH that's good!

62
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,240
OOH that's good!

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,080
OOH that's good!

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:38,580
OOH that's good!

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,300
Did the video help? No.

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,780
All the comments about me are just saying 'whos that old fat ugly loser in the background?'

67
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,610
Look

68
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:58,980
I-I knew that I'd become irrelevant at one point but not this soon. How long has your meme been out?

69
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,650
I dunnoâ€¦ 9

70
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,500
10 days

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,480
I had a good run

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,740
well

73
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,640
The dream is over now so I guess all that's left to do is just

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,390
disappear, along with the thousands of other dead memes. See you soon philosoraptor

75
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,620
hey

76
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,590
Are these your shirts? Yeah

77
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,270
yeah, ooh

78
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,550
That's god?

79
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,990
yeah

80
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:35,900
This is brilliant. You know, I think this is exactly the slogan christianity's been looking for because people are always asking us questions

81
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,520
Like, why does it tree look like that and now, we have our answer

82
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,460
Oh that's god

83
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,660
Exactly! Man give me that christian side hug. All right

84
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,320
Rodney, went on to become a large meme in the christian world thanks to his new OOH that's god meme

85
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,440
Christianity became cool again. his next single with mean baby girl was an instant success

86
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,460
OOH that's god!

87
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,880
OOH that's god!

88
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,860
OOH that's god!

89
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:17,120
OOH that's god!

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,360
I should probably call my kids and my wife

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,530
Wonder where my dog went...

92
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,220
Los Angeles what land of all dreams?

93
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,730
See I got a picture of hollywood in a frame this is hollywood

94
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:42,540
I like hollywood

95
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,960
it's not what you think

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,340
I make $4 million in 2 seconds. You make $4 in 3 years bitch

97
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,180
I don't even care about these towels

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,120
Water that comes out of this sink is gold

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,900
Check out the soap man. It's just soap

100
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,040
Maurice? Yes? Please

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,980
Sorry

102
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:16,950
I think it's four, cause Jarrod bought two, because he wanted yellow and then he got green. Decided that

103
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:26,910
He probably is returning that one. I think it's three

104
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,110
Hey, guys it's rodney thank you so much for watching, my documentary if you, want to watch another documentary that they
