1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:28,439
yeah I want to show you something I hear

2
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,380
this is Pier 40 so like World Trade

3
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,950
Centers there that's the Holland Tunnel

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,530
Canal Street this is the pier but look

5
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,219
at this this space right here alright

6
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,550
this is the pier this is like the tip of

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,289
the pier the very tip and then that's

8
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,020
like a room there with windows on both

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,059
sides two big open empty space how

10
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,670
amazing would it be to move my studio or

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,980
Dean headquarters out to the tip of this

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,140
pier and we just work in this like glass

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,290
greenhouse situation like 500 feet off

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,799
the shore of Manhattan city of New York

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,330

[Music]

17
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,479
going back to look at that face

18
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,250
most EFT is this idea right now it would

19
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,900
be the greatest office space

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,390
in all of New York City I mean also make

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,860
a good apartment but there's so many

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,300
weirdos that go out there to smoke pot

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,160
and do whatever that might be a little

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,220
strange look that's what it this little

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,160
pier right here that end of it is where

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,600

92
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,160
going to happen with all these TVs the

93
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,849
Jews will have a quad box of eight boxes

94
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:41,050
on and who picked out the monitors they

95
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,039
really only monitor the compatible with

96
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,360
Apple you know what else they charge you

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,699
never see things huh I don't think about

98
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,789
all of them I admit when Empress but are

99
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:57,550
you this is the LD Apple monitor these

100
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,320
things cost a fortune you just plug one

101
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,229
plug into your computer they're amazing

102
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,909
I've always wanted one but I couldn't

103
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,180
justify the price but between Slade and

104
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,320
Jake they ordered one two three four

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,060
five six seven of them you think that's

106
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,820
enough slice seven of these monitors oh

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,490
we're going to as well we got your two

108
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,320
red cameras yeah this is the beam

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,509
production we don't know what to call

110
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,259
yet what these are just the work lights

111
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,389
like these are the lights in here that

112
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,280
just give it like generic lights you can

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,229
work if you want to fire up any of these

114
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,470
crazy lights that like you're going to

115
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,320
like these crazy disco lights then you

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,730
have to use this

117
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,680
to light them I have not been trained on

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,640
this yet it's something we're like

119
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,590
things are happening but we're actually

120
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,260
producing content just yet we're doing

121

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,500
up momentum towards actually like

124
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,060
publishing stuff from being just as we

125
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,170
