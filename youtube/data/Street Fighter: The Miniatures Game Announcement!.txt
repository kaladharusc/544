3
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,040
hey guys angry Joe here and I want to do

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,850
the full reveal for the thing that I

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,400
have been working on for the past two

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,880
years behind the scenes you see all the

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,910
research here that has gone into Street

8
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,520
Fighter the miniatures game and the time

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,880
has come it's finally ready we are going

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,739
to be launching our Kickstarter you've

11
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,050
probably seen me put a few video teasers

12
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,420
and some angry reviews and some video

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,300
content but it like I said it's finally

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,470
ready to be released on Kickstarter

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,890
April the 4th so I'm hoping you guys

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,670
will really support this I've worked so

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,360
hard on it

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,830
and I just hope that you can see the

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,560
quality of the game I really wanted to

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,850
blow this out

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,479
make it the most impressive game that

22
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,490
fits out there because I wanted to do

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,160
these licenses justice and so what is it

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,030
well it's a sort of a miniatures board

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,020
game hybrid where you play with

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,970
pre-painted collector sized miniatures

27
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,130
like these massive miniatures if you

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,520
look here Zangief is bigger than a

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,680
Nintendo amiibo so you're getting a

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,690
Nintendo amiibo and these things can

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,299
sell like you know 15 dollars a pop at

32
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,979
the store sometimes and you're getting

33
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,430
six of these guys in the core set and

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,950
then there's also a boss expansion with

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,760
Akuma and and bison and overpowered form

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,920
so there's two more so eight of these

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,700
things and they all come with 40 card

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,640
battle decks not know crappy small size

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,430
cards but not like magic sized cards and

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,290
well hold on I'll show you boom oh my

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,450
god just to lay all this out this is

42
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,670
what we've been working on all these

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,510
different decks and yeah so basically

44
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,549
you're playing with these characters one

45
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,880
on one you can do free-for-all up to six

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,880
players it gets insane you can do teen

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,640
games two on two three on three and

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,230
the most unique things that separates

49
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,450
this game it's a completely original

50
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,819
system that I created and that took a

51
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,890
while to find the right balance but

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,890
after all this time we found it but you

53
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,500
can interact with 3d terrain and so

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,690
there's a lot of strategy you know in

55
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,320
placement and moving around and you know

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,110
basically optimizing your your moves and

57
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,440
creating combos for bigger hits using

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,920
the old truths and the supers it's it's

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,630
a ton of fun and that's why I'm so

60
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,420
excited and I wanted to show it all to

61
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,000
you so this is all prototypes these are

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,430
like actually just 3d printed miniatures

63
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,590
that you've mined from my printer back

64
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,810
there you probably hear it going and

65
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,400
some of these are manufacture prototypes

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,790
but we wanted to add like really amazing

67
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,190
special effects to just blow these

68
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,560
miniatures out of the water and create

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,650
the industry best looking thing like I

70
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,690
wanted if you were to whip this out like

71
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,519
at a gaming convention and people we

72
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,350
don't will run over me like what is that

73
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,560
because it's has such table presence

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,230
with the 3d terrain the colorful amazing

75
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,239
art and and the pre painted miniatures

76
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,170
so basically the best game possible and

77
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,989
and so it being this premium it's going

78
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,420
up on Kickstarter and that's because it

79
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,390
goes directly to you guys because of the

80
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,820
production cost being so high because I

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,799
was like I want the best of everything I

82
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,260
don't care you know I'm not here to make

83
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,700
a bunch of money I'm here to make the

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,459
best game possible and so you know

85
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,410
distributors and retailers they want

86
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,049
like 50% off the product and that's all

87
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,210
the cost so I wouldn't even break even I

88
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,830
probably lose money if I sell that

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,650
through distribution and retailers we'd

90
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,360
have to bundle it differently because

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,550
I'm packing like eight miniatures in

92
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,580
here for maps 3d terrain for each of

93
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,919
those four maps and and these things are

94
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,990
huge and so that's why it's on

95
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,090
Kickstarter because it'll go directly to

96
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,090
your doors and so for Street Fighter or

97
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,460
our goal or main hope is that we sell

98
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,570
10,000 copies and if you know

99
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,669
Kickstarter once you hit your goal like

100
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,620
everything after that unlock stretch

101
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,770
goals and so you may be asking you

102
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,870
so where's my favorite fighter Joe you

103
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,970
know and that might be in the stretch

104
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,340
goals when you get that unlocked for

105
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,710
free that's how they who are ya you know

106
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,080
so you do a big pledge you back at

107
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,810
whatever amount and then as the game

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,819
does better and better we are able to

109
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,919
offer you free miniatures and so we have

110
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,909
12 free basically you know like amiibo

111
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,389
sized miniatures and 12 like magic sized

112
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,819
bags coming to you for free if we can

113
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,440
hit all our stretch goals if we can just

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,830
get 10,000 copies of the of the game

115
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,440
soul and so my question is are there at

116
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,900
least 10,000 passionate Street Fighter

117
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,139
fans or or 10,000 really passionate

118
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,150
angry Joe fans that have loved my videos

119
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,729
and want to give back or just fans of

120
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,120
board games that just look amazing in

121
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
general and so this whole time I've been

122
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,750
putting up pictures here for you and

123
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,030
I'll show you these components and sort

124
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,879
of the Kickstarter stuff and what's in

125
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,500
the Kickstarter so what's in the pledge

126
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,960
you'll you'll see that here so the

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,479
starting pledge is $80 so that I can

128
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,150
pack everything into the box there's a

129
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,069
hundred and twenty dollar level if you

130
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,710
want the boss expansion you want the

131
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,900
stretch goals so you triple your game

132
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,779
size and then there is the the insane

133
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,069
all-in pledge and that'll get you not

134
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,770
only all the core Street Fighter the six

135
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,960
from that book and hopefully the twelve

136
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,270
from the stretch goals but also Street

137
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,639
Fighter Alpha for characters their

138
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,159
Street Fighter 3 for characters their

139
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,710
Street Fighter 4 for characters their

140
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,020
and Street Fighter 5 for characters

141
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,960
there so this is just a huge celebration

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
of the franchise because it's been over

143
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,250
30 years of Street Fighter and so I kind

144
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,639
of look at it like that so I just wanted

145
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,199
to make the best game possible and it's

146
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,020
crazy being on this end of it now I've

147
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,539
been reviewing games for the better part

148
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,580
of my life and now in making games and I

149
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,190
have so much more perspective and

150
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,250
appreciation for how hard it is to make

151
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,500
some of these games and how many

152
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,270
different directions you can go but

153
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,339
after two years we've really found a

154
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:10,940
system that

155
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,800
not only works inverses but in

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,510
multiplayer that was the hardest part

157
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,150
and free-for-all is like three separate

158
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,910
games before when you do the boss mode

159
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,190
because of three players verse one super

160
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,920
overpowered guy and it's just so much

161
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,900
fun and so that's what I've been working

162
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,590
on and I just please want to ask you

163
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,690
guys to back it because the better it

164
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,720
does the more things that we get to do

165
