4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,080
I got to go for this guy that LeMans

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,230
Strauss wants me to hunt down now for a

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:22,109
number of reasons to gunfire well it

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,160
seems like something I should probably

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,060
intervene on okay hang on let's get my

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,340
rifle out I don't know why you guys

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,950
decided that I needed to be shot at punk

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,570
okay well you guys probably shouldn't

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,399
stand there where I can very obviously

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,670
hit you run the arm okay well you're

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,469
walking it everybody I'm glad I can just

15
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,140
walk up here and kill these people for

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,420
you hey howdy how are you doing there

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:13,170
I'm a murderer no problem yeah well I am

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,799
a hero

19
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,619
a goddamn Savior this land now don't

20
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,720
look at me that closely while I loot

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,060
these people it's uh it's all in a day's

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,479
work now don't think nothin of it it's

23
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:36,420
just I lost my contact somewhere

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,920
hmm all right well you have fun building

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,049
that house wonder if that's dynamics

26
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,720
there's no way there would know there

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,950
would be no way that they would have a

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,810
dynamic house building system where

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,220
settlers could just build houses

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,920
wherever that would be amazing if they

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,320
did but I highly highly doubt that

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,810
that's actually the situation here cuz I

33
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,299
would be way way way too ridiculous but

34
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,560
then again this game is surprising me

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,289
before so maybe honestly who knows howdy

36
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:09,630
hello hello how are you

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,920
honestly like I bet if I had more time

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,420
because I know that the main game is

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,840
probably like I suppose a beer don't

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,400
tell me where I isn't ain't supposed to

this is altering cinematic but I had a

100
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,910
feeling that this particular mission was

101
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,420
gonna be particularly story movie for

102
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,560
some reason I mean it was the only one

103
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,870
left and I have a funny feeling that

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,790
that's the idea mine no wait he's gonna

105
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,980

106

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,200
guarded it's perfect all right throw it

166
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,190
through stopping a train pain in the air

167
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,430
sure but what if we could force a train

168
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,660
to stop of course we get a wagon full of

169
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,900
some flammable oil put it on the tracks

170
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,240
they see it they know they either have

171
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,910
to stop or die you know train driver

172
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,920
wants to be cooked alive

173
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,990
kind of brilliant mm-hmm for you and

174
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,570
that is real idea I think that's the

175
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,420
first time you ever had one of them shut

176
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,990
up you might be the first bastard to

177
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,000
ever have half his brains eaten by a

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,790
wolf and end up more intelligent so

179
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,380
we're doing it yeah we're gonna need

180
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,650
ammunition guns look real frightening

181
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,350
and some dynamite to open up the Train

182
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,240
I'll get the supplies got a head into

183
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,800

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,690

186
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,300
always heading into that refinery

187
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,860
there's an old run-down Shack just over

188
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,600
the border north of a place called

189
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,610

00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,970
was in Korea we saw a lot of leg

327
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,069
landscape and architecture and and also

328
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,140
just nature out there but cuz it's a

329
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,270
small country it's about the size of

330
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,049
Ohio but the the densest areas of

331
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,100
population are in the cities and in any

332
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,600
other place like there's really not that

333
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,940
much development out there there's a lot

334
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,610
of landscape and there's a lot of just

335
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,260
area because they really emphasize

336
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,539
around Seoul and Busan in the cities and

337
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,610
even like the city where my grandparents

338
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,169
are in Foshan that's it's kind of like

339
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,030
what they might consider to be the

340
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,250
boonies even if it's like not that

341
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,190
terribly out of the way but you know

342
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,929
there was a lot of beautiful beautiful

343
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:58,250
beautiful landscape it's a very

344
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,380
mountainous country like a lot of

345
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,789
mountains I mean it's guys coastal

346
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,740
cities and whatnot but we were driving

347
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,289
through with my my uncle my uncle was

348
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,120
driving us to me who's he's a maniac

349
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,440
he's the kind of guy that doesn't

350
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
believe in speed bumps and there I could

351
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,000
go into detail about the whole way

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,450
traffic works in in South Korea but

353
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,390
let's just say he he took advantage of

354
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,250
the speed when he could and it wasn't a

355
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,780
very convenient moment for any of us

356
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,179
because they're very painful like going

357
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,039
over every single speed bump at 40 miles

358
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,510
an hour

359
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,800
but that's besides the point so he was

360
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,080
driving us down to Busan which is a

361
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,910
strange story in and of itself like we

362
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,429
were driving down to boon Sun we left

363
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,559
one day and we made a whole bunch of

364
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,150
stops along the way to see like

365
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,160
landscape these mountains called the

366
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,800
donkey ears we went and saw this temple

367
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,090
that was built up in the mountains where

368
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,410
there was gold in the hills at one point

369
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,559
and then we got into Busan at like 10

370
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,650
o'clock at night what was that

371
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,929
kill some we got into Busan at 10

372
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,070
o'clock at night just long enough to

373
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,410
like go to a restaurant that we didn't

374
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,970
want to go to and that's another story

375
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,910
entirely but uh I'll tell those stories

376
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,910
in a bit is Jose how much time I got

377
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,190
here make sure I get this story right no

378
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,630
all right I'll tell those story in a bit

379
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,000
but just like there's a lot a lot a lot

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,559
of beautiful landscape out there in

381
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,170
Korea that uh that I never would have

382
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,300
imagined there to be because I went over

383
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,640
there like before I was a shitty kid you

384
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,470
know going on trip you never appreciated

385
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,690
the trips like when you're actually in

386
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,670
it as a kid but then later on you know

387
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,260
now that I'm older I can I can go there

388
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,140
and I can just be like oh shit I was so

389
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,330
fortunate to be able to go there at the

390
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,309
time and also like I'm super fortunate

391
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,100
to have all this family that I can

392
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,860
connect with that never let like never

393
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,480
gave up on me even though I was just

394
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,580
like bear whatever you know family in

395
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,770
Korea who cares like I'm not gonna talk

396
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,900

397
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,030

488
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,980
about how I got the boots on with my

489
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,840
parents in Korea so we we were obviously

490
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,430
going to Busan to see the city but so we

491
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,960
get in there about 10 o'clock at night

492
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,260
10 o'clock at night we roll up and by

493
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:33,620
the time we get there we're hungry by

494
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,670
the time we get there up and my mom to

495
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,650

496
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,690
people you know how okay imagine you

497
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,380
were in a situation where somebody walks

498
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,030
into a restaurant trying to sell

499
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,530
something you know how everyone would

500
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,970
just kind of like casually ignore I'm

501
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,290
just being like oh god why is this guy

502
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,150
here like this is the wrong place for

503
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,480
this my mom's the type that goes oh

504

506
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,900
got going and then actually buys what

507
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,730
they're selling like negotiates haggles

508
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,710
and buys it so when we get out of there

509
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,900
like we're at like this coastal city

510
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,430
where there's a lot of tourist

511
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,170
restaurants along the coast that are

512
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,760
like they got people outside they're

513
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,970
like I made our food

514
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,670
dude mango pie eat our food come on and

515
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,590
you know you know ordinarily just look

516
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,910
at their you look around and find

517
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,710
something you actually like but my mom

518
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,010
the first person that yells at her to

519
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,590
eat at their restaurant she crosses the

520
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,940
street we're not even parked in a

521
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,620
parking space we're parked in the middle

522
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,860
of an intersection for some reason walks

523
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,690
across the street through traffic

524
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,460
there's traffic there's no light there's

525
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,190
no crosswalk shit just walks like oh

526
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,020
okay walks across the street and then

527
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,530
goes over to talk to this person like oh

528
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,940
okay well we don't really want to eat

529
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,100
here but we don't see here everybody

530
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,840
come out we're eating here and so the

531
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,760
food is like ridiculously expensive the

532
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,280
food is not good and I asked my mom

533
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,500
afterwards why the hell do we stop here

534
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,350
oh no that's goddamn beautiful and she

535
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,000
goes like well I didn't want to be rude

536
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,470
I'm like it's not rude if you refuse to

537
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,000
eat at a restaurant that you didn't want

538
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
to eat at they're yelling at you you

539
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,210
don't have to listen to him cause she's

540
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,760
like okay okay whatever you know but

541
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,200
it's fine so we ended up going to a

542
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,910
different restaurant I think like that

543
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,810
restaurant just to put in perspective

544
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,450
like food at restaurants in Korea it's

545
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,800
slightly cheaper than food at

546
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,720
restaurants like here and you get a lot

547
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,760
more food for it because Koreans are all

548
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,040
about food all about eating ooh

549
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,760
it is just food heaven over there and so

550
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,880
we eat at this restaurant and it's like

551
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:43,380
this really really mediocre fish really

552
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,270
mediocre for being a coastal city it was

553
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,610
like not good they also cheap I'm not

554
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,010
much for shellfish I like normal fish

555
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,510
just fine but shellfish and stuff I

556
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,430
can't do but they had this shellfish

557
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,220
that they cooked in cheese like they

558
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,220
they had an aluminum foil tin they had a

559
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,520
bunch of cheese in wait what what what

560
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,480
what what what what what no no no no no

561
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,760
hang on okay I'm not gonna let you get

562
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,740

563
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:17,960

564
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,690

566

569
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,020
by trying to do that

570

I better not of Law School because those

571

are those are hard to counter those are

572
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,500
ridiculously hard to counter like I

573
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,790
don't know what I didn't have my rifle

574
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,980
they knocked me out my horse like it

575
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,930
said what are you supposed to do you got

576
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,640
no defense for it I guess Deadeye would

577
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,370
be a good idea now whatever all right

578
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,050

579
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,410

584
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,650
there you go

585
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,679
[Music]

586
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,040
you keep hidden all that matters maybe

587
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:45,940
even from yourself okay all right well

588
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,710
thanks for the weird fortune very

589
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,460
ominous okay I wasn't following you I

590
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,780
was actually getting on my horse so I

591
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,760
can do some sweet drifting okay anyway

592
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,040
so we eat at this restaurant it's really

593
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,049
really bad so imagine clams and cheese

594
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,610
and I'm sure clams and cheese is

595
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,580
actually a thing but when I had it man

596
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,950
that it was not good and I don't even

597
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,360
like clams so we spend about $100 on

598
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,660
barely enough food to feed the six of us

599
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,770
and then what ends up happening is we

600
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,530
leave that restaurant we go to the hotel

601
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,919
that's too small for any of us it was my

602
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,270
uncle trying to show off because he had

603
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,540
this like condo in Busan but it was like

604
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,040
a one-bedroom and there were six of us

605
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,120
and we were all trying to sleep there

606
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,110
and it wasn't working too well

607
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,059
but it was fine cuz like my uncle was

608
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:40,280
very nice and that was great but we

609
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,900
dropped our stuff off at the hotel and

610
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,500
then we end up going to another

611
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,030
restaurant a real hole-in-the-wall

612
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,620
restaurant like a lot of Korean

613
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,210

614
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,860

615
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,900

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,140
same guys from the first game the same

843
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:54,320
sons of bitches the same sons of bitches

850
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:39,880
so suspiciously much like

851
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,660
Big Sean I hope he's just found where he

852
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,930
is like I said don't worry about them

853
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,100
world is full of disagreeable man that's

854
00:48:51,100 --> 00:49:14,740
why you got all of us cats so

855
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,690
fascinating to see how like history is

856
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,670
written from the victors like from this

857
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,770
perspective like because we all enjoy

858
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,810
society and yet you can kind of

859
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,390
empathize with him a murderous outlaw

860
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,160
it's like you're trying to ruin our way

861
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,420
of life just leave us alone

862
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:45,400
even though we're oh you know what's

863
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,640
wrong I better go speak with touch okay

864
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,200
hey you did real fuckin good job kid you

865
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,000
see how this guy might be a good dad

866
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,600
someday but Maggie I would I just met

867
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:14,410
some guys a fellow named detective

868
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,390
agency and they know about the Train and

869
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,580
they know well you followed back here no

870
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,270
they nowhere near here and they want you

871
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,970
Dutch they offered me my freedom in

872
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,650
exchange they did why didn't you take it

873
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,040
very funny well what do we do now

874
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:43,310
I say we do nothing just yet bitch is

875
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,440
trying to scare us into doing something

876
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,590
stupid we have turned a corner we

877
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,610
survived them mountains we just need to

878
00:50:55,610 --> 00:51:01,790
stay calm man now I'm grown used to the

879
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:05,050
beard I only want to change it anymore

880
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:13,370
mountain man okay so I guess now's the

881
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,840
time to do the John Marston mission

882
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,250
which is what we actually were out here

883
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:25,160
but that's a oh why is this waypoint

884
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,240
wait what I think the waypoint says

885
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,380
there might be a little brick broken

886
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,120
there but my god and then is crazy cuz I

887
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,150
really really wonder really really

888
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,130
wonder about things you know sometimes

889
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,180
cuz obviously society is a good thing

890
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,490
overall with flaws and whatnot but

891
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,560
generally speaking it's it's a good

892
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:54,530
thing oh no bottoms up Linda alright

893
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,170
yeah but it's like whoops what did I

894
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,800
just do whatever yeah it just comes down

895
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,040
to like these are satella it's like

896
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,750
exactly what the Pinkerton guy said he's

897
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,750
a douche he's just a slimy greaseball

898
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,210
the bastard but at the same time he's on

899
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,500
the quote-unquote right side of history

900
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,600
but it's like he said cuz these guys

901
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,480
live savage lives and their lives are

902
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,360
gonna end savagely and that is the truth

903
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,640
of it all but the story is still to be

904
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,060
told like the story is still be seen of

905
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,370
how these people live it's not good life

906
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,950
but it's a good life for them not good

907
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,540
for the people they're robbing it's not

908
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,470
good for the people they're killing

909
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,450
bad their destructive lives but for them

910
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:52,619
that's all they know okay fine by me you

911
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,780
don't need to do nothing about that yeah

912
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,480
missus this is a fascinating moral

913
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,510
dilemma like you can empathize with

914
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,740
someone but that doesn't mean that

915
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:05,040
they're in any way good oh is that the

916
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:14,420
horse that I stole oh sorry

917
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,130
how do ice I don't know how to just like

918
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:28,800
stop that is disgusting I want one that

919
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,840
let's see what we're dealing with here

920
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,970
ooh

921
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:36,300
uh-huh who Rodney that's so weird that

922
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,310
there's this rotten animals out here if

923
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,780
there's an animal that I killed like how

924
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,780
persistent is this world that's a

925
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,520
fascinating thing how persistent could

926
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,630
it be weird I don't know

927
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,099
also eventually I get to the point where

928
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,380
I start hunting birds because I know

929
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,030
that birds and bird feathers they're

930
00:53:54,030 --> 00:54:11,769
good

931
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:24,440
what happened over there is the mindful

932
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,299
I think that might be my fault I

933
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:36,559
startled them Oh God Oh straining you

934
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,180
know the calming rain that'll make me

935
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,789
feel better I have no idea what the hell

936
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:44,839
just happened but uh okay I'll just

937
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:48,890
mosey on by to the rain I love the rain

938
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,999
I've said this before where what I'm not

939
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:02,200
doing I'm just okay we're up here now oh

940
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,380
okay all right

941
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:11,150
anyway I love the rain I do I really do

942
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,499
I've talked about it before but there's

943
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:13,789
something very calming about the rain

944
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:16,219
it's something that I miss when I'm out

945
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:18,460
in LA cuz it doesn't rain nearly enough

946
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,619
hardly at all and not that where I came

947
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,690
from was an exorbitant amount of rain

948
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,829
but there's always something very

949
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:27,529
calming about it it's soothing in a way

950
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:31,700
just to see the rain just sitting by a

951
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,339
window when it's raining and reading a

952

961
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,240

962

too much cargo right yeah whatever

963
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,850
you're strong and what would we have

964
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:21,330
done without horses no probably not a

965
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,310
lot we'll be riding elephants everywhere

966
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:29,460
I wonder when I wonder what horses

967
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,880
actually came into play no idea there's

968
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,080
a lot of things in human history that I

969
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,780
just have no idea about okay alright is

970
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,050
this still leaking why don't I get rid

971
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:43,730
of the horses before yeah whatever John
