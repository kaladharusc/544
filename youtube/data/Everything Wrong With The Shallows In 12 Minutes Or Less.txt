1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,920
sony logo alone takes 15 seconds then it

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,870
morphs into a 19 second Columbia logo I

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,920
don't even think the Columbia label

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,170
existed anymore point is 34 seconds for

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,820
two logos for the same company is too

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,020
much and everyone knows it in its

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,369
signature look I realize this is a

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,720
laid-back tropical paradise and

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,010
everything shouldn't this kid be

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,539
somewhat super biased I mean this is a

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,890
beach that has to be known for its short

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,570
population right no adults are even in

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,310
sight kids x-ray vision allows them to

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,660
see the floating helmet that's hidden by

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,550
a rocket this GoPro is perfectly edited

16
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,899
footage in order to properly freak this

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,469
kid out

18
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:35,610
come on moving her phone is clearly

19
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,410
visible right there using visual tricks

20
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,730
like this to try and make Instagram

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,360
cinematic Istanbul doing the pics even

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
though this picture says mom 1991

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,570
dumbass driver asks this dumbass

24
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,610
question Jesus crisis movie over apps

25
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,129
not so many getting hoarse yet that's

26
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,020
gringas she's not coming way too much of

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,699
this plot is relying on this stupid King

28
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,289
friend getting slammer Don tequila the

29
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,910
night before also why is Nancy figuring

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,160
this out now this is a secret King Beach

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,300
that's way the fuck out in the middle of

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,650
nowhere but she just planned on meeting

33
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,570
Ana out here at some point why not wait

34
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,130

Don Julio and bad choices ladies and

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,979
gentlemen the screenwriter these text

38
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:14,760
messages are going through

39
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,439
instantaneously even though Nancy's out

40
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,030
in the heart of darkness and should have

41
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,990
very little reception

42
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,670
I am reliable movie glosses over the

43
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,110
ability of this driver to speak pretty

44
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,640
perfect English until it's convenient to

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,780
add a translation gag

46
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,170
what is this bitch call

47
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,479
not gonna tell me cool hey so how did

48
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,770
you ask for a ride to a beach you don't

49
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,210
know the name but did you say to this

50
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,530
guy back at the hotel to get him to take

51
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,119
you here with you not even knowing where

52
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,220
you were going this is the one hey how

53
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,409
many other secret beaches are there she

54
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,060
knew the beach by sight but not my name

55
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,830
and it was still able to describe it to

56
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,149
him to get her here even though she's

57
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,960
never been here

58
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,789
smoothie is playing with me hardcore

59
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,530
early on this girl simply has not enough

60
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,880
information about this place to get here

61
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,259
and also has too much information about

62
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,210
this place this is a shark attack movie

63
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,619
and I'm already angry not even 6 minutes

64
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,710
in did you spot eyes perfect and nothing

65
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,929
bad will ever happen here cut and print

66
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:05,100
you know there are a lot of things that

67
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,420
bother me about this movie but nothing

68
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,369
is worse than those stupid earrings that

69
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,720
somehow become important of a plot later

70
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,330
see I don't know we were going the same

71
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,400
way at least clothes life its Carlos a

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
professional driver or does he work at

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,459
the hotel and for some reason was

74
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,560
knocking off work at 1:30 p.m. or was he

75
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,000
just a random dude that Nancy hit up for

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,650
a secret be tried I mean I was in

77
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,299
medical school but we didn't have sense

78
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,040
it's a cheap excuse for expositional

79
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,569
dialogue on Nancy's medical background

80
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,989
is cheap how you gettin out of here over

81
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,000
okay either she's joking and she has no

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,709
plan for a ride out of here potentially

83
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,940
because she knows sharks will attack her

84
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,260
and change her plans where she actually

85
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,730
thinks uber will pick her up here which

86
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,109
makes her just stupid enough to maybe

87
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,850
deserve a good shark attack to snap her

88
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,350
back to reality Ellis is obviously

89
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,489
employed as a professional woodworker

90
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,410
oil changer metal collector and Terk

91
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,940
salesman we interrupt their short movie

92
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,840
to bring you an urban outfitters

93
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,940
commercial she labels the bag that has

94
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,650
some pink sunscreen it's a clear bag

95
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,120
with three containers that obviously

96
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,010
indicate their sunscreen dear moody you

97
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,420
cannot get me to fall for the standard

98
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,970
hot girl disrobing the hell leash also

99
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,319
given the way a half-naked Nancy's

100
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,730
working this bored and confused as to

101
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,260
whether I'm watching surf porn or actual

102
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
porn yep definitely only want to zip up

103
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,069
that wetsuit to maximum cleavage levels

104
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,720
it serves no other purpose in case

105
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,130
you're wondering yes the following 60

106
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,450
minutes will consist of lingering shots

107
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,489
of Blake's lively lady lumps damn this

108
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,109
wave is perfect storm levels of huge

109
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:17,940
after the super tepid looking beach we

110
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,530
first saw the director realizing how

111
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,700
thin the premise was for this movie

112
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,319
relied heavily on slow-motion to make

113
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,730
sure the screw was feature linked say

114
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,170
how many cuts do you think we need for

115
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,430
her diving into this wave and paddling

116
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,560
after is it 5 because it's 5 even if you

117
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,380
don't think it should be 5 of the very

118
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,819
few surfers that know about this secret

119
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,260
Mexican beach happens to also speak

120
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,700
perfect English you America

121
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm sure surfers are a pretty chill

122
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,550
Bunch overall but Nancy's in the middle

123
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,620
of nowhere by herself out on open water

124
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,330
disclosing personal information to two

125
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,070
strange men hasn't she ever seen 48

126
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,900
hours this is like how all of them start

127
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,510
only once not a day I wanna tag it slow

128
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,670
it becomes an island for shouting I

129
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,380
think I'll be alright this is almost a

130
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,790
rivers roll credits mixed with the dun

131
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,700
dun dun punto de rigueur please skip

132
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,380
that wave she's surfing so how the hell

133
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,760
can they see what she's doing since that

134
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,440
wave should absolutely be blocking their

135
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,570
visas dude this is a big beach for only

136
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,920
three people but you got a surf you're

137
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,630
surfing right on top of Serena van der

138
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,340
Woodsen here ante wouldn't hang with the

139
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,840
guys before because she thought they

140
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,310
might be creepy but now that they've

141
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,630
seen each other's SERPs they're all

142
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,650
buddy-buddy

143
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,990
[Music]

144
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,669
this is what would happen if you scored

145
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,740
Blue Crush with darude-sandstorm this is

146
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,449
a borderline iconic shot and I'm tempted

147
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,770
to take a sin away but then I think

148
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,449
where are all the claims that were so

149
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,250
super gnarly like three seconds ago well

150
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,360
that was fun wasn't it

151
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,590
guess it's time to head back and grab

152
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,240
some margaritas with Anna who probably

153
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,560
has drunk off her hangover by this board

154
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,759
the director said hey let's have you

155
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,050
eaten the Apple after showing off your

156
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,639
badass surfing skills because apples a

157
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,020
portable food one might eat on the beach

158
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,370
and also we weren't sure how to make the

159
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,599
shark look like an asshole it didn't

160
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,280
have him attack you Nancy has her phone

161
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,840
pictures sorted too conveniently show us

162
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,069
the progression of her mother's story

163
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,139
holy this director has never seen an

164
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,580
extreme close-up that hasn't caused a

165
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,659
spontaneous erection

166
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,479
sir crop not only does Nancy get cell

167
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,710
reception on this incredibly remote

168
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,509
island paradise she can stream discount

169

FaceTime perfectly I mean look she's

170
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,090
only got two ping bars showing that mean

171
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,560
watch how you wind up on mantle great

172
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,300
okay short crop would be excellent at

173
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,889
cinema since that's what we fill crop

174
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,659
who do you want me to say say you're

175
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,159
coming back say you're not dropping out

176
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,840
of med school after all this time oh my

177
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,460
god this movie is heaping exposition

178
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,690
under this character that needs very

179
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,520
little you're a shark movie movie feel

180
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,560
free to shark at any time don't do that

181
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,780
don't make this about her what else

182
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,000
would it be about um I don't know sharks

183
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,469
you know there's a limited amount of

184
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,090
beach area here we're those assholes

185
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,650
with the GoPro go they're not out in the

186
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,090
water and it's clear from the shot that

187
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,530
no one else is overhearing the obvious

188
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,150
backstory conversation with pops it's

189
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,380
becoming more and more apparent that we

190
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,340
would have been having a much better

191
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,870
time watching a movie about Anna's

192
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,180
shenanigans on this trip hey let's go

193
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,310
ahead I'm gonna catch my last one main

194
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,050
character wants one last score cliche

195
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,729
one of many pseudo 10 fake outs that

196
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,139
occur within 15 minutes of this movie ah

197
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,030
sudden CGI Dalton hey it looks a hell of

198
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,889
a lot like a giant whale carcass gotta

199
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,990
go explore that seriously but presumably

200
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,340
they all been surfing next to this

201
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,810
extremely visible whale corpse for

202
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,979
several hours but she's just now

203
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,659
noticing it honestly can't tell at this

204
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,340
shot of a shark chasing her in the waves

205
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,289
she's surfing is cooler lame I'm gonna

206
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,669
send it just in case but I have a

207
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:16,960
sneaking suspicion that this shot is

208
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,699
actually cool shark is more interested

209
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,319
in being a mischievous dick than being

210
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,819
an actual predator I know it's the main

211
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,289
plot of the movie and all but Nancy

212
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,940
survives this okay she's just been

213
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,500
bitten and dragged under by the shark

214
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,819
but look at the amount of blood on

215
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,500
display here this is blood loss enough

216
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,300
to cause death and yet she pulls through

217
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,219
I mean this shots suggest she lost all

218
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,960
her blood and someone spilled Cheerwine

219
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,789
in the ocean by the gallon even though

220
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,350
who wound is still wounded the water

221
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,150
from absurdly red to perfectly clear in

222
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,810
just a few quick frames and that's why

223
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,090
you always leave a note dan this movies

224
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,440
done such a good job at establishing

225
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,150
position that I'm even more confused so

226
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,650
why nobody noticed the enormous whale

227
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,970
carcass right next to them while they

228
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,740
were surfing wow it's like everything

229
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,120
the surfer dude told her about earlier

230
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,980
is getting in on the action if only he'd

231
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,240
mentioned there are also sharks

232
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,740
I'll take things I did not need to see

233
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,260
for 800 Alex Nancy is spilling copious

234
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,700
amounts of blood into the water but is

235
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,140
only inches away from her yet this

236
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,180
dickhead shark who exploded a dead whale

237
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,650
to get to her is running an errand or

238
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,120
something while she stitches herself up

239
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,620
luckily Mexico has their own version of

240
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,150
a Bruce Almighty moon in order for this

241
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,710
scene to be properly lit yeah you're

242
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,820
gonna want to go ahead and just cut that

243
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,240
off hey sure Nancy always travels with

244
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,070
incredibly sharp jewelry for an occasion

245
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,930
just like this goddamn this movie's

246
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,610
cheeky gadget displayed cheekiness it's

247
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,870
like a hallmark movie with a real

248
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,970
Hollywood budget

249
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,290
Nancy perfectly sums up the last hour of

250
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,660
this movie also dear Hollywood we do not

251
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,160
need to see people puking to get the

252
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,460
point

253
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,740
gone Nancy's magic surfboards gonna stay

254
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,360
right in place throughout an entire tide

255
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,920
change

256
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,380
yeah well it's a movie and he's a shark

257
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,870
so yes I realize Nancy's desperate here

258
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,250
but what does she expect to happen if

259
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,810
she gets to the magic surfboard she was

260
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,280
on it when the shark first attacked so

261
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,420
it's clear mister shark don't give a

262
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,370
fuck about surfboards magic or not why

263
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,930
is Nancy still pouring blood when she's

264
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,280
in the water the wound was barely

265
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,750
bleeding a few minutes ago sure she's

266
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,460
using her leg more this is more blood

267
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,870
than when the folks of Amity were coming

268
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,340
for Jaws

269
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,990
he gravely injured Nancy once again I'll

270
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,819
swim the large aquatic predator to get

271
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:12,270
to safety

272
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,530
holder if the Sharks going to lose its

273
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,849
shark guard when it could spec too short

274
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,039
village yeah I'm starting to wonder if

275
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,270
this movie is just a chance to see how

276
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,710
many ways Blake Lively can painfully

277
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,569
exclaim sudden guy passed out or dead on

278
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,969
the beach cliche wait what Beach dude

279
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,319
happens to wake up just as she's

280
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,610
screaming at him though he will end up

281
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,080
being a drunk thief who won't help her

282
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,580
and this is just another red herring to

283
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,259
pad the runtime yeah he's pretty badly

284
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,909
injured but the bigger question is why

285
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,409
can't this game shark finish anyone off

286
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,940
this drunk mother or somehow wriggled

287
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,130
away and was able to drag the lower half

288
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:43,079
of his body to shore movie wants to make

289
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:44,670
me believe that this somehow Cynthia and

290
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,470
Seagal is actually Nancy spirit animal

291
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,600
oblivious surfer dudes that again missed

292
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,370
the giant king will corpse yesterday are

293
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,079
back again two hilariously walked past

294
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,820
the man corpse that's lying on the beach

295
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,820
torn in half Oh frog here I want these

296
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,589
dense motherfuckers to die so hard that

297
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:02,790
I actually hope the shark eats them in

298
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,110
slow motion even though it's obvious

299
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,550
it's coming shark jump scare still

300
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,920
deserves a sit

301
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,720
GoPro guy also has a magic sword that's

302
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,370
able to cause even more unnecessary jump

303
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,290
scares and yet the water level on this

304
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,790
rock Island has changed very little over

305
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,050
the last 20 hours or so

306
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,459
dickhead shark finally the science of

307
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,050
swim by to let us know he's still around

308
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,579
I mean thing's already eaten three

309
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,110
humans and most of a whale does it

310
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,850
really need any more food it's gonna

311
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,250
hard just for a second and then you're

312
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,380
going to be okay an 80 minute movie has

313
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,779
time for this 32 seconds from the whale

314
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,579
to the rock incredible disappearing

315
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,110
whale carcass comes back into play for

316
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,279
the final act even though we haven't

317
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,720
seen that person's it was blowed up by

318
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,100
mr. shark about 30 minutes ago

319
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,630
also the Sharks only been doing this

320
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,279
routine for a little while now since he

321
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,480
was previously swimming around the

322
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,100
entire cove hoping to jump scare people

323
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,540
to death might be presumptuous to assume

324
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,490
an accurate schedule with a small last

325
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,250
sample size

326
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,420
did he seriously just wait for her to

327
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,500
turn around holy

328
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,360
this shark loves drama nancy pass at the

329
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,040
time by watching some sick x-games

330
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,900
auditions in this angle the shark is

331
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,010
coming directly at the camera before

332
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,630
killing random surfer dude but the

333
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,370
camera somehow undamaged starting I

334
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,690
think this movie secretly just a long

335
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,340
commercial for GoPro let's go three

336
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,990
other people since I got here let the

337
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,820
cap into the GoPro it was recording

338
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,200
perfect video and was untouched by the

339
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,790
shark but when Nancy uses it the feed

340
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,110
looks like an old camcorder with a

341
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,240
malfunctioning tape dad I gotta get off

342
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,970
this rock stone there I want you to know

343
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,250
I'm gonna fight like she taught her this

344
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,690
moment is such a mixture of cheesy

345
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,100
cliches that it should be called a

346
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,470
cliche souffle

347
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,730
are you kidding me this is what the

348
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,720
director should have said to the

349
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,890
screenwriter when he first read this

350
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,870
scene

351
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,040
Nancy makes a broad assumption that the

352
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,450
shark doesn't like jellyfish because it

353
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,860
wasn't a fan of the core and decides the

354
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,690
best way to avoid certain shark death is

355
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,130
to swim through a massive probably also

356
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,320
deadly jellyfish the biggest sin here is

357
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,090
this plan ends up working even a little

358
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,460
after this attack shark once again

359
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,050
pieces out until the scripter question

360
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,750
to return where are you damn I guess

361
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,250
they used up the effects budget before

362
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,720
the final actions this shot looks so

363
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,710
terrible it could have been used in

364
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,540
sharknado I have no idea if a big shark

365
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,920
could actually eat an entire metal buoy

366
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,630
but if it can it shouldn't be

367
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,800
susceptible to a gentle tap on the nose

368
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,120
what having worked

369
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,970
whatever that shark in course the only

370
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,530
one that can rescue Nancy is her driver

371
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,030
from the beginning of the movie everyone

372
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,650
else on this Beach is a drunk thief or

373
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,150
an incompetent millennial none of these

374
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,620
dumbasses think to turn Nancy on her

375
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,450
side while she's aspirating on sea water

376
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,130
while Nancy leaves their hallucinating

377
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,260
Carlos does jack to help her out like

378
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,910
transporting her to safety or getting

379
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,340
her a bottle of water ready to get wet

380
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,290

381
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,790

382
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,140

383
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,000
from her injuries reenroll in medical

384
