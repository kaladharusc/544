[Music]

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,230
forty-eight seconds of logos for a

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,420
goddamn mainstream comedy with two huge

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,219
stars you had to get multiple production

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,049
companies together to get this made I've

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,539
always wanted to be a dad man I'm sure

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,160
glad this wacky comedy about a family

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,390
conflict starts out with some helpful

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,859
narration because otherwise I'd be

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,930
fuckin lost and I love my Ford Flex

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,689
Jesus Christ movie weights 1 minute 13

12
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,250
seconds before sucking a product

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,710
placement and it deep throats that don't

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,669
be tickle it or nothin

15
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,820
I love how you drew my hair I'm guessing

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,940
it's dog poop homeless man poop movie

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,290
restrains itself for almost two and a

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,670
half minutes before finally releasing

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,230
its first poop reference I hope it

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,100
didn't pop a blood vessel

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,570
you couldn't find the good and just

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,129
about anything Sarah accidentally

23
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,690
explains why Will Ferrell signed on for

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,010
this movie I know this is supposed to

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,539
show how much these kids hate Brad but

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,800
shouldn't someone at the school have

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,629
noticed this pathological behavior it's

28
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,739
not like they're just showing him debt

29
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,539
there's a disturbing variety and how he

30
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,640
dies was that weird first-ever

31
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,559
stepfather and son talk and this guy has

32
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,329
to ask if taking a picture MIT Talk is

33
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,920
weird you know movie there are ways to

34
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,240
play they're not used to being a father

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,010
angle without veering into not used to

36
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,970
being human territory

37
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,799
Brad's registering shop not that Dusty's

38
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,299
calling but that this house still has a

39
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,119
landline in 2015 okay yeah my credit

40
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,180
score is 752 I'm sorry what sort of

41
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,130
fighting styles am i proficient in sure

42
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,570
this is played for laughs but what do

43
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,650
you either these things have to do with

44
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,420
the other this dusty want to fight Brad

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,909
or steal his identity wild he's crazy

46
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,500
then you end up with two kids yeah I'm

47
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,759
stuck there holding the bag and he's

48
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,560
nowhere to be found and Sarah waited to

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,060
give Brad this very basic information

50
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,710
until just this moment how did this

51
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,000
asshole ever get past the initial

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
audition phase hey you guys see I know

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
dusty is attractive and but there are

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,970
dozens of people walking around here why

55
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,770
does Brad know immediately that it's him

56
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,829
and a Callen saki Kawasaki 9 even the

57
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,149
step kid should be calling him out on

58
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,009
this bull the movie needs it to lead

59
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,469
into she get on a man come on hilarious

60
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,270
action sequence later so no one says

61
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,310
anything holy even for a Lakers fan this

62
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,049
is overkill or when Fletcher didn't even

63
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,700
have this much swag the king

64
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,310
stop he missed a bad Looby expects me to

65
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,869
believe that in a house this large the

66
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,099
boy and girl children have to share a

67
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,489
bedroom

68
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,840
it makes for neat conversations like

69
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,370
this but isn't at all the way this

70
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,930
family's bedroom layout would unfold I

71
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,160
guess they're squeezing both kids into a

72
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,420
single bedroom so they can use the other

73
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,040
four bedrooms in the house for like man

74
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,989
caves and scrapbooking rooms this family

75
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,220
apparently recreated the Nirvana

76
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,599
nevermind cover with one of their kids

77
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,180
one day at a pool you have no idea who

78
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,310
you're dancing with dusty gets into your

79
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,290
head that's what he does and this movie

80
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,819
sure does set Sara up to be a wet

81
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,709
blanket with the sight of emasculation a

82
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,080
peppering of magnitude and a soupÃ§on

83
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,790
helpfulness it's so refreshing to see a

84
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,940
woman written in such a nuanced way

85
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,959
comedies rely on stretching the

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,030
believable to unbelievable places a new

87
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,590
stepdad that wants to do right by a step

88
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,360
kids and their father believable that

89
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,920
father moving in and getting the kids a

90
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,269
dog but still being accepted by the

91
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,400
stepdad unbelievable this movie dances

92
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,780
all over that line so much you'll give

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,750
up and just accept anything eventually

94
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,510
[Applause]

95
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,650
the more I watch this movie in the more

96
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,030
I'm convinced that Sara's the primary

97
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,860
antagonist because she does nothing but

98
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,750
exacerbate the situation besides you

99
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,430
know what happens old dogs his shelters

100
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,630
he's gonna have to walk The Green Mile

101
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,970
why is he yes sir how the these kids

102
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,840
know what the Green Mile is goddamn

103
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
considering how earlier the first poop

104
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,750
joke came in I guess it's a minor

105
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,859
miracle that we've lasted this long

106
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:29,220
until the second Mark Wahlberg's in

107
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,200
terrific shape in his mid-40s here do we

108
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,430
have to get a reference to him not

109
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,799
wearing a shirt in every concomitant see

110
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,630
this is only funny on SNL or som this

111
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,220
movie is so far presented itself as part

112
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,900
of reality and this embedding of a

113
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,340
person through a wall is more indicative

114
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,319
of cartoon violence this vehicle takes

115
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,730
the kids to school and others but not

116
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,139
being pulled over by the cops for being

117
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,989
half smashed and not roadworthy 103

118
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,870
points

119
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,040
damnit this movies trying to rock star

120
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,299
me into thinking Mark Wahlberg can

121
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,010
actually sing when I know from the Funky

122
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,200
Bunch days that he definitely cannot I

123
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,450
worked in radio for years snowiest would

124
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,340
be hired for his jingle singing and said

125
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,989
jingle would be recorded mix produced

126
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,730
and start airing that day the paperwork

127
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,989
alone would take a week and a half

128
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,989
he started I just think it's it feels

129
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,030
wrong why because he's black

130
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,590
well yes that is what he means but how

131
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,970
do you know that guy's black you

132
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,440
literally just walked in and the dude is

133
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,340
already back in the room working

134
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,289
upstairs please allow me to pay you for

135
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:25,639
your time and travel don't do me any

136
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,889
favors Paula Deen wow what an incredibly

137
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,300
general reference that I'm positive will

138
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,830
stand the test of time to buy all the

139
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,150
gear we need what calls Mona just hire

140
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,400
someone else Angie's List hmm definite

141
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,599
Angie's List brought up placement here

142
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:36,889
but it just feels weird not to mention

143
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,750
Kraig and his list as well in the King

144
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,520
he thought the Steph King seemed okay at

145
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,710
first a little soft maybe this kind of

146
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,330
is all the movie has going for it

147
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,039
literally take turns trying to convince

148
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,750
the kids which dad is best super

149
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,430
original such creativity honey listen

150
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,479
seriously the only character traits

151
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,039
listed for Sarah must have been clueless

152
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,289
oblivious and birth to children I know

153
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,060
Brad's trying to show dusty up here but

154
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,260
where the hell are the actual aquarium

155
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,090
guides for the field trip and when has

156
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,590
any presentation ever elicited

157
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,090
spontaneous applause from elementary

158
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,590
school students come on Brad could have

159
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,180
moved one King step to the left or right

160
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,310
to avoid this cheap gag its jokes like

161
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,479
this that made the movie-going public

162
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,250
firmly reject this stupid garbage and

163
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,539
ensure there would definitely never be a

164
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,760
sequel I've seriously seen better CGI on

165
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,169
Saturday morning shows on the Christian

166
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,970
Broadcasting Network okay so a

167
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,919
skateboard is so old it has dust on it

168
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,449
gotcha but he's supposed to be a

169
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,190
relatively recent stepdad he would have

170
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,570
moved that old a skateboard into the

171
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:37,340
closet what eight months ago okay I

172
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,720
guess we should all selectively turn our

173
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,340
brains off and laugh hysterically when

174
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,419
something magical happens in this

175
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,430
otherwise reality-based comedy yep they

176
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,960
can afford a house this nice in this

177
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,970
neighborhood which surely has HOA rules

178
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,009
about smashed SUVs in the driveway but

179
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,990
they cannot afford to fix the SUV I

180
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,150
always had to be the bad guy mom giving

181
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,400
out the carrots and the punishments wait

182
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,440
carrots aren't punishments didn't she

183
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,940
mean handing out the carrots as the

184
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,740
punishments why does this household keep

185
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,060
eggs in the fridge in two different

186
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,590
spots and why did they refrigerate these

187
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,840
for Hormel microwavable meals check

188
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,430
books buddy almost everything is solved

189
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,960
by violence now Sara's just outright

190
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,280
agreeing with everything her ex-husband

191
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,510
says in addition to being totally

192
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,370
unhelpful to her new husband Jesus not

193
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,510
to mention how wrong the things she's

194
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,699
casually agreeing with is if I had a dad

195
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,190
like dusty when I was your age maybe he

196
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,389
could have taught me how to stand up for

197
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,400
myself this line caused John Lithgow to

198
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
immediately jump up from his couch and

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,340
submit his name for the sequel in order

200
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,260
to defend Brad's father's honor dr.

201
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,270
emilio Francisco you heard of him oh my

202
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,090
god yeah he's been on dr. oz like 10

203
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,550
times in a world where dr. Phil and dr.

204
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,620
oz are treated as factual as a textbook

205
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,110
we could just try right right Sarah

206
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,210
becomes immediately fuckin baby crazy at

207
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,229
the first mention of the fertility

208
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,580
doctor even though she's done very

209
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,470
little parenting in this movie what is

210
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,660
it with this fucking character is he

211
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,639
wearing right now a lounge chair design

212
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,260
accidentally printed onto a shirt a

213
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,360
combination shirt condom Jeremy Scott

214
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,010
design eaten and vomited out by Barney

215
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,900
also the Bud Light is strong with the

216
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,000
scene oh wow apparently this movies set

217
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,260
in New Orleans which you could totally

218
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,580
tell by the cultural diversity and

219
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,539
vibrant environment hey dusty hey why is

220
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,400
he coming here better question why was

221
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,199
he lingering just outside the door even

222
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,940
better question why was the testicle

223
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,389
examination room door wide open hmm what

224
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,190
she so can impress by she's obviously

225
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,320
seen this at least twice before movie

226
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,940
joins Boogie Nights and perpetuating the

227
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,530
myth that Mark Wahlberg has a giant dick

228
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm afraid to record I don't think kid

229
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,940
came to play wait why is he encouraging

230
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,380
dusty to produce an exorbitant amount of

231
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,789
semen I know this is an unconventional

232
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,800
doctrine but is there a reason for this

233
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
besides getting in yet another lazy

234
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
bodily fluid Joe daddy's home treads

235
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
boldly into territory already charted by

236
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,610
a dozen better comedies jerking off at

237
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,419
the fertility clinic

238
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,560
I bet the pitch for this movie was

239
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,030
literally Will Ferrel jerks off at a

240
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,590
clinic oh and Marky Mark has a huge

241
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:42,919
penis

242
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,780
jesus-tap-dancing-christ this is some of

243
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,889
the laziest comedy writing since

244
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,620
hangover 3 how difficult would it be for

245
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,720
someone to whip up a batch of your

246
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,440
Cinnabons

247
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,910
between the dialog and the computer

248
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,410
screen the scene just earned the coveted

249
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,150
Jeremy gives you the middle finger Award

250
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,160
for a Cheers sellout Ness also Brad

251
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,990
loves that classic never mind photos so

252
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,400
much that he's also got it in his office

253
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,919
Dylan you have created right down the

254
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,810
hall like the Great Wall of China is way

255
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,400
too fucking touristy and over visited

256
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,620
for this sex act to have happened not

257
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,060
only are the blinds wide the fuck open

258
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,380
after dark apparently these windows

259
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,479
don't hold sound in for I wrote several

260
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,080
sins about all the bull in this kid

261
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,120
bedroom and deleted them all Laker jokes

262
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,470
despite this movie being set in New

263
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,169
Orleans shared bedroom jokes spider-man

264
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,120
Space Shuttle jokes but ultimately this

265
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
kids bedroom is mostly guilty of being

266
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,330
too busy it's an orgy of evidence that

267
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,159
someone staged this room this room

268
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,229
absolutely zero reason Marquis would be

269
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,300
allowed or invited to attend the results

270
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,579
of wills fertility test but hey comedy

271
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,320
am i right he's got a fighting chance of

272
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,050
getting you pregnant god damn it I don't

273
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,820
care how good this doctor is shut the

274
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,610
door pee outside the room that does he

275
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,130
sleeps in he's gonna smell your urine

276
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,690
somehow Thomas Haden Church found an

277
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,160
even more sexist character to play than

278
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,070
his role in sideways come on 5-it no you

279
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,500
know get on this I really rather not

280
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,209
it's at this point that you realize this

281
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,829
script is running on fumes and relying

282
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:03,480
on overlong jokes to drag itself to

283
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,000
feature-length cleans thing absolutely

284
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,040
and it's at this point that you may be

285
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,269
wondering why this video doesn't have

286
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,490
more sense well I'll tell you why like

287
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,320
this that's so aggressively average that

288
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,820
makes the movie neither overly offensive

289
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,680
nor enjoyable at all so because it

290
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,149
wouldn't be much fun to hear me say boy

291
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,920
this sure is average thirty times I'll

292
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,350
just go ahead and add 36 I'm here to

293
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,790
defeat you take back my family and that

294
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,470
can't change now follow your noble

295
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,050
example do it aboveboard

296
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,279
honestly I mean has dusty had a

297
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,660
life-altering change of heart that we

298
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,160
weren't informed about obviously he not

299
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,750
only left Sarah with the kids but they

300
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,070
also went through the process of a full

301
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,570
divorce so I guess the only reason he's

302
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,980
back in the picture is to spite Brad

303
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,899
which is a pretty stupid reason for this

304
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,670
movie to exist once again they still

305
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,800
having to fix this fucking SUV and this

306
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,390
house is so small that two children at

307
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,430
the shear bedroom just can't believe her

308
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,920
that enough folks not one present from

309
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,019
dusty hey kids let's don't forget who

310
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,610
got you a dog this movie's creator saw

311
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,930
stepbrothers and said why not

312
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,000
stepfathers and then copy pasted this

313
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,839
into existence oh yeah I remember the

314
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,250
dong that's only been on screen for one

315
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,110
or two random site gags yep he's still

316
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,759
around

317
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,959
modern comedy gives the finger at a time

318
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,730
and logic and how Brad would ever have

319
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,319
had time to set all this up because the

320
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:20,600
laugh is the extremeness of the scene

321
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,579
and considering the Lakers went 21 and

322
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,100
61 and 2015 this is really stretching

323
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,689
the boundaries of reality why the hell

324
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:29,129
did Brad get dusty a ticket to the

325
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:29,879
basketball game

326
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,170
even if he were rubbing his face in the

327
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,459
generosity that's a completely

328
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,379
unnecessary expense and it provides an

329
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,329
opportunity for dusty to upstage him you

330
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,329
should sit in your $18,000 seats and

331
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,709
think of all the better ways that your

332
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,480
family could have used that money well

333
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,279
who finally woke up and started paying

334
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,079
attention to connecting sensibly where

335
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,220
have you been the entire movie lady

336
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,439
hears pelicans young star Anthony

337
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,970
whatever his name is acting like he's

338
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,069
made the NBA playoffs and it's just as

339
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,360
hilarious to me as this movie acting

340
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,649
like it takes place in New Orleans

341
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,540
dude I know the pelicans aren't a hugely

342
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,339
popular NBA team but this is the

343
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,930
playoffs for fuck sake look at how many

344
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,540
empty seats there are Brad's character

345
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,920
will now briefly be played by Frank the

346
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,329
tank this terrible and unfunny line is

347
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:13,589
still better than the entirety of

348
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,449
semi-pro just saying look I know he got

349
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:16,769
drunk and kicked out of the game but

350
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,600
he's been leading the house even if

351
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Sarah is super pissed at him how is this

352
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,540
gonna help things she brought up how

353
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,129
much the game tickets cost but now she's

354
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,720
banishing him to potentially waste more

355
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,699
money on a hotel movie tries to ring one

356
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,589
more joke out of the smashed SUV but

357
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:30,420
that was way too rekt to be open for

358
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,399
baggage storage now the entire family

359
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,899
gathers around to watch Brad take the

360
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,699
walk of shame to really ensure the knife

361
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,470
was twisted at the end of the scene hey

362
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,300
you're not saying here he's been here

363
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,889
all fucking week but now she's kicking

364
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,660
him out god damn it it's not Linda

365
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,980
Cardellini s fault but this character

366
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,649
sucks do a movie you can't show me day

367
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,389
by day escalating and then suddenly go

368
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,240

369
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,839
blankets and the hot plate and the Bo I

370
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,149
crapped in the wastebasket I'm so bored

371
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,019
with this movie that I'm actually

372
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,490
relieved to have a poop reference to

373
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,529
write about also even if Brad is living

374
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:02,790
at the office don't they have bathrooms

375
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,500
I know he's depressed but he's not

376
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,809
conferral you cannot say oriental his

377
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,439
name was you woo could've been Xavier

378
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,970
that's so racist it's almost

379
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,920
government-approved dusty came by a bar

380
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,959

the way out to Brad's office to tell him

384
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,550
dusty

385
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,230
might be planning on skipping town has

386
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,610
this character shown any interest in

387
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,779
this family other than squatting in

388
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,980
their house Wow wait this school's prom

389
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,839
spent 110 thousand dollars on light

390
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,580
bulbs wait this is the father-daughter

391
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,500
dance right so why is the brother here

392
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,089
and Brad were planning on taking his

393
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:36,480
daughter

394
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,769
why didn't he first go to the house and

395
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,329
take her little things like this that

396
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,560
make this movie not only boring but

397
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,630
boringly annoying

398
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,490
Jesse Brad not only thought immediately

399
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,779
to look in the airport but he was also

400
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,279
able to get through security find the

401
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,480
right terminal and locate the correct

402
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,519
bar at the exact time dusty was there I

403
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,810
wanted to prove that I was a good dad

404
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,010
too but I'm not okay

405
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,750
primary antagonist becomes a sympathetic

406
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,579
character in about 30 seconds cliche

407
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,160
no you gotta come see Sarah after what I

408
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,170
said - how long is Brad planning to be

409
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,610
gone then Jesus if I had to leave the

410
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,899
house for four days after every time I

411
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,220
got too drunk I'd never seen my bed

412
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,260
after the vile this movie has shown me

413
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,730
even the establishing shots of the

414
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,380
daddy-daughter dance are uncomfortable

415
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,079
[Music]

416
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,700
no way man the slow-motion treatment is

417
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,230
for a hero coming in to save the fucking

418
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,820
day these assholes were totally gonna

419
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,170
miss this dance and they're super

420
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,570
fucking late so this walk-up I need you

421
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,709
take the first one you're under more

422
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,060
than I have dusty please she's your

423
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,709
daughter how did I miss

424
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:26,790
great question considering this

425
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,200
conversation took place less than four

426
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,920
minutes ago

427
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,230
why even here daddy better be this evil

428
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,430
4th grader would be excellent at

429
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,529
cinemasins finale dance-off intended to

430
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,450
make me smile actually makes me rage do

431
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,649
you even realize how many ponies and

432
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,029
sparrows and flowers I trampled on my

433
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,500
way here to narrate the sin the fact

434
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,730
that brats inspired to take his shirt

435
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,899
off during a dance off at a

436
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:43,980
daddy-daughter dance should immediately

437
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,750
disqualify him from dad of the Year

438
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,310
contention so I guess everyone just

439
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,660
forgot about the brazen assault by both

440
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,770
the child and the parent or the other

441
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,149
child that just happened a few minutes

442
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:52,020
ago yes

443
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,640
okay whatever moves us along to the end

444
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,560
of this fucking slog movie sets itself

445
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,360
up for a sequel featuring John Cena as

446
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,070
the primary villain only to pretty much

447
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,209
abandon it in order to further

448
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:06,040
facilitate Mel Gibson's comeback

449
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,560
you do not tolerate I Drive a Dodge

450

457
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,270
my last words were I'm on drugs

458
