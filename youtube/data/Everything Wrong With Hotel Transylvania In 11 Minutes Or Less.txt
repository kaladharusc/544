2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,320
this batch you of Liberty gag does

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,190
nothing to keep me from getting

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,840
frustrated at another 40 seconds of

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,880
logos are these suddenly lit candles on

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
some sort of motion timer or do they

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,940
just have a setting for when the joke

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,730
demands oh hush little bad pirate don't

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,020
say a word

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,029
I'm 87% sure the pitch for this movie

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,890
was Adam Sandler will sing in a weird

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,480
Dracula voice immediately followed by a

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,519
400 studio execs putting down payments

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,410
on in-ground pools and new breasts I've

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,260
odd you want to kiss her tush

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,550
considering you're about to change a

17
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,020
dirty diaper right now I'm all sorts of

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,460
read it out exactly how vampires

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,840
interact with their children this movie

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,070
finally answers the question that no one

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,180
was asking do vampires oh we never go

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,800
out there ever

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,360
then maybe keep the door shut does

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,860
Dracula have the ability to travel into

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,210
the future because in order to have a

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,280
children's book like that in 1895 you

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,940
would have to do two

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,690
let me wipe all your poopy way Sam there

29
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,250
lands his second poop joke in the first

30
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,510
three minutes of the movie can he keep

31
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,040
this incredible fecal ratio going for

32
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,450
the rest of the film there's still a lot

33
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,590
of movie left so let's make like

34
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,270
Shawshank and see how much we have left

35
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,920
to crawl through really finally get the

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,120
freedom you thought I was kidding about

37
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,800
the pitch but less than three minutes in

38
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,900
we've already had two Sandler songs you

39
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:27,300
moving well didn't rhyme at all

40
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,800
zom Jekyll implication but of course be

41
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,310
smart

42
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,160
no bonfires no firework shows fire

43
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,440
shadowing yeah it's a mess back there

44
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,700
where exactly is this Pumpkinhead

45
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,410
editing spending the cash Wain just gave

46
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,530
it welcome to Hotel Transylvania

47
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,020
Roland edits I have personally designed

48
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,210
the spectacular schedule of events all

49
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,740
leading my daughter's birthday

50
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,600
extravaganza tomorrow

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,070
so you're just forcing the guests to

52
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,149
participate in your daughter's birthday

53
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:53,920
celebration Dracula might be losing some

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,270
of these vacationers to sandals next

55
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,240
year there is a clogged toilet 340i so

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,729
many poop jokes you know what let's just

57
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,229
send them all right now so we don't to

58
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,570
worry about this anymore

59
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,260

60
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,090
a sentient sponge that gets off an

61
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,070
absorbing urine we aren't even ten

62
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,300
minutes into this thing and I swear I'm

63
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,710
already losing my will to breathe any

64
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,000
more oxygen from this planet

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,350
all right everyone say it together now

66
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,150
Frankenstein was a scientist not the

67
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,770
monster we all good now can we move on

68
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,840
so Frank's pieces are just connected by

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,670
flat surfaces no wonder he falls apart

70
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,030
so much monster stink you're kidding me

71
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,380
right in my lobby

72
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,940
Dracula didn't seem to concern when

73
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,200
Wayans kids were pissing all over the

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,520
furniture but this is where he draws the

75
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,490
line only Martha were here to see this

76
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,040
she's always here one in your left

77
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,780
breast pocket get it it's a toadstool

78
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,550
nice visual pun and all but it has

79
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,630
nothing to do with this movie and

80
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,890
doesn't even adhere to anything

81
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,690
resembling the laws of EM physics you're

82
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,610
old enough to drive a hearse now you're

83
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,680
old enough to make your own choices you

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,820
have to be a hundred and eighteen to

85
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,140
drive on your own that's a lot of years

86
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,700
of having to drop Mavis off at scare

87
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,560
camp wait why did this shirt shrink when

88
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,090
she turned into a bat but the Hat didn't

89
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,430
guys guys she can handle it she's a

90
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,740
Dracula for pete's sake but seriously

91
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,290
watch out for fire he says in a room

92
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,150
with about a hundred lit candles also in

93
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,130
118 years Mavis has never thought to

94
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,840
sneak out don't you bring ET into this

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
Mavis don't you dare damn it it's 1:00

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,970
now my baby will be safe forever so a

97
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,680
father demonizes the outside world by

98
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,420
creating fake creatures to keep his kids

99
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,040
in a secluded community forever no one

100
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,420
told me this was actually a remake of

101
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,100
the village hey you don't need a

102
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,170
mannequin leave the mannequin here well

103
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,790
now we know where Andrew McCarthy has

104
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,450
been all these years

105
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,190
why is the revolving door still spinning

106
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,390
wouldn't it be hitting them continuously

107
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,489
you have to leave Oh No

108
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,989
Dracula could easily just burn right

109
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,519
past these monsters but instead needs to

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,840
make the situation more difficult than

111
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,220
it needs to be because Sandler can't

112
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,750
resist a resolution better suited for a

113
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,489
sitcom than a motion picture can't kill

114
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:45,850
him

115
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,620
it would set monsters back hundreds of

116
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,480
years considering no one else knows the

117
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,100
monsters or hotel is here seems like a

118
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,959
non-issue right now Quasimodo

119
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,340
why is Quasimodo here isn't he

120
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,840
technically just a human with physical

121
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
deformities in fact I'm pretty sure the

122
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,660
whole point of the story was that he was

123
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,620
not a monster

124
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,760
even though everyone treated him like

125
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,769
one drunk Dewey how did Jonathan manage

126
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,450
to Monster Mash this flying brain we've

127
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,650
only seen them flying above the floor

128
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,910
what was it even doing down there

129
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,140
where did the shrunken head on the

130
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,519
doorknob come from it wasn't there when

131
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
Dracula and Jonathan initially entered

132
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,850
the room is that real about the garlic

133
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,639
thing yes I cannot have my throat swells

134
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,230
if Drac really sees humans as the enemy

135
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,940
why is he being so upfront with this one

136
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,500
his weaknesses come on man loose lips

137
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,780
sink overacted infantile animated Adam

138
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,250
Sandler movies at least I think that's

139
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,210
how that quote goes yes I know

140
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,060
I apologize go go back to doing what you

141
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,610
were doing in sex wrong with you people

142
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,320
seriously you have a secret door that

143
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,610
opens into the honeymoon suite and

144
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,200
another that opens into the shower are

145
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,550
we sure Drac didn't build this hotel

146
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,590
because he's a giant vamper Burt also a

147
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,930
bare-bones humor hey what are you doing

148
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,970
here no Mavis what are you doing here is

149
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,290
one of your vampire powers plot

150
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,150
advancement these monsters gonna kill me

151
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,620
not as long as they think you're a

152
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,080
monster huh that's kinda racist

153
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,220
Johnny Stein would be excellent at

154
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,090
cinemasins what brings you here Oh party

155
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,860
planner I get that these monsters

156
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,480
haven't been around a lot of humans if

157
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,280
any but they've been around monsters

158
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,570
enough that they should know Jonathan is

159
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,920
not one even though the whole thing with

160
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,450
Johnny is a ruse Mavis his surprise

161
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,730
party isn't so why is she there watching

162
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,140
a potential band that could be playing

163
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:22,120
for her later

164
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,530
did you just reference Mavis now being

165
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,750
legal and everyone's cool with this in

166
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,390
monsters also awful band somehow knows

167
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,919
new song when a stranger hops up and

168
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,940
starts a cliche and 20 there's no end 27

169
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,919
and bingo the end column has numbers 31

170
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,780
through 45 I call bingo shenanigans

171
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,700
shenanigans not sure how Bride of

172
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,710
Frankenstein here has five different

173
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,150
bingo cards that are identical and

174
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,530
furthermore how they all have different

175
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,580
numbers stamped on them why do these

176
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,320
flies eyes have pupils one earlier they

177
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,000
had more accurate compound eyes also

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,890
since when is charades a spectator sport

179
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,910
are there professional charades

180
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,560
tournaments I'm unaware of if I wanted

181
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,730
to just sit and watch someone flail

182
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,960
their arms around like crazy for no

183
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,580
reason I'd watch a youtube vlogger this

184
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,440
movie has an actual scooter montage the

185
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,970
monsters are taking turns riding a

186
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,440
scooter to the tune of sexy and I know

187
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,180
it it's literally the only instance of

188
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,950
LMFAO that happens in this entire movie

189
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,590
relax no one suspects anything the only

190
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,730
thing that looks weird how much

191
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,620
whispering you're doing except this has

192
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,000
happened quite a few times and no one

193
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,790
has noticed until now Oh dad that was

194
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,780
not fun

195
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,419
everyone running jumping swimming with

196
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,940
no order that was the opposite of fun so

197
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,530
it was the ridiculous six of parties

198
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,610
look

199
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,790
remember nothing of this encounter

200
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,020
you've had mind control powers and not

201
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,400
use them this whole time the whole time

202
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,810
follow me

203
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,020
oh no no Mavis I can't I have to leave

204
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,020
you sure it'll be fun okay the power of

205
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,050
boners compels you someone help me

206
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,670
understand the geography on this if he

207
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,110
came out of a chimney already how was he

208
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,400
not already seen this view I'm only

209
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,020
gonna be 121 once right gotta live it

210
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,910
yes but since vampires can't really die

211
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,380
very easily I'm guessing they haven't

212
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,490
steeped themselves in the deep

213
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,980
philosophies of the Yolo oh man

214
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,880
the sunrise from here must be amazed if

215
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,650
I know my astronomy and I'm sure I don't

216
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,150
the Sun actually starts by lighting the

217
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,440
highest point of the object and works

218
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,480
its way down as it rises seriously go

219
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,190
watch the Sun rise from your roof I'll

220
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,780
wait pick a joke movie does the sana

221
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,670
create steam from these coals or is it

222
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,750
the dragon you showed me earlier

223
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,580
neither joke is that funny anyhow so why

224
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,020
contradict yourself 17 to 40 a 16th of

225
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,790
47:19 would it make more sense to have

226
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,290
each table go to the spot nearest to

227
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,310
them since they're all the same

228
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,680
also is the tablecloth or the table the

229
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,970
ghost and how exactly does that work

230
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,560
neither of those items are alive in the

231
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,970
first place and therefore can never die

232
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,330
and come back as a ghost

233
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,130
so these monsters do still kill humans

234
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,840
pickle a movie right and all these extra

235
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,190
tables come from those tables be

236
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,030
breeding like rabbits

237
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,050
sir breaks Alon is what you're going

238
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,420
with really sure cuz the knights of the

239
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,220
round table joke was right there do you

240
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,510
love it occasionally MODOK yes wait so

241
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,160
these Knights of the Living Dead or some

242
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,780
sort of Alexa mesh network thing and

243
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,950
Quasimodo just happens to be walking

244
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,270
through a hallway with several of them

245
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,570
yeah that's certainly convenient why

246
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,160
does that hurt me because in an Adam

247
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,330
Sandler movie getting kicked in the nuts

248
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,680
is one of the greatest honors that can

249
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,030
be bestowed upon you the only way to

250
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,530
rank higher is if you go full Sandler

251
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,180
and take genital trauma while farting

252
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,620
loudly telling a poop joke and being

253
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,400
embarrassingly naked at the same time

254
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,750
and if I had a bridge I would jump

255
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,940
I'm sorry the last thing I wanted was to

256
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,190
hurt her or you because I met all of you

257
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,040
a few hours ago English please your

258
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,380
voice is really annoying see that's

259
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,490
funny because it's friend Drescher

260
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,060
saying it

261
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,039
Jesus this movie

262
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,329
the water in the pool didn't do anything

263
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:41,829
- Jonathan's hair her makeup but somehow

264
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:43,239
as Morelle de jumping on him does the

265
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,459
trick he says be holds a human why the

266
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,559
23-19 panic though sure they're finding

267
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,819
out he's human but they've been

268
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,049
literally partying with him all night

269
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,879
they know he isn't dangerous right but

270
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,439
the monsters brought luggage in items

271
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:55,029
right and where are they going to walk

272
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,059
to two lonely bags crashed in the night

273
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,040
they're eating first you tell us humans

274
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,509
are back now they're good but who on

275
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,129
dying and made Drac King any of these

276
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,629
monsters think for themselves don't they

277
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,739
I'll have homes where they might come

278
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:07,089
into contact with humans and make up

279
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,319
their own minds

280
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,910
okay ready Jonathan get the car he was

281
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,170
mountain climbing before he ended up at

282
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,730
the hotel if he had a car he would have

283
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,110
just gone back to it and never even seen

284
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:27,160
the hotel right so everyone is just

285
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,720
fully on board with monsters being real

286
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,949
in this universe and why would these

287
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,470
humans be carrying a torch so hardcore

288
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,329
for Frank if monsters not actually do

289
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,679
any monstering in this universe and if

290
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,999
not how do they even know what the hell

291
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:40,199
they are synchronize cape lifting

292
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,129
commercial airplanes retract the landing

293
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,019
gear immediately after takeoff unless of

294
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,339
course you install the ones with a sense

295
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,379
of slapstick comedic timing Acula what

296
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:53,769
my hands in a tan shoe so considering

297
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,029
track has been flying and direct

298
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,559
sunlight for the last three minutes and

299
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,910
now he's carrying on this completely

300
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,019
nonchalant and nonsense of a

301
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,429
conversation in full sunlight either

302
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:02,019
that whole vampires and the Sun thing is

303
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,639
just a minor inconvenience or movie has

304
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,169
too much moving to do to be bothered

305
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,999
with rule consistency oh sure

306
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,319
earlier when you needed mind control

307
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,669
Johnny a couple of millimeters thick

308
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,619
contacts prevented it but here you mind

309
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,119
zap through about an inch of heavy-duty

310
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,499
airplane glass it's almost like the

311
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:16,299
movie is trying to contradict itself I

312
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,059
hope you can hear me and forgive but

313
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,739
even if you can Jonathan is already on

314
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,239
the plane so maybe this is going to have

315
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:26,079
to give him a minute how is Dracula

316
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,489
still speaking through the pilot if he's

317
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:28,569
not in front of him to give him the

318
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,610
hypnotism eyes do you really mean it dad

319
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,320
go make your own parrot

320
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,570
but maybe somewhere with less Sun I

321
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,890
thought I found a love when she was just

322
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,660
a fling when did we decide all animated

323
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,160
movies had to end with a musical number

324
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,450
is it a way to trick the audience into

325
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,560
thinking they had more fun than they

326
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,000
really did as they leave as if a full

327
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,380
two minutes of assorted auto-tune

328
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,150
monsters forcibly rhyming the word zing

329
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,220
is going to cure somehow the 90 minutes

330
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,470
of nothingness that came before it the

331
