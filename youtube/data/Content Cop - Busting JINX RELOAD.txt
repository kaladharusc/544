00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,949
hey there folks I'm the content cop I'm

10
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,750
here to make sure everyone's content is

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,110
up to par and if it's not I'll bring

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,480
them to justice we've all made content

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,339
that we're not very proud of maybe it

14
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:55,500
was a cringy Gangnam style video from

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,430
back in the day

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,100
possibly a Slenderman video that you

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,409
look back and say ooh that was pretty

18
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,539
gay of me maybe you combine both of them

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,940
and you did a cringy Slenderman Gangnam

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,950
style video maybe you made a bad

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,619
thumbnail or two maybe you didn't make a

22
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,720
thumbnail at all and it was just a still

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,220
frame of your video because you were

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,050
either retarded or you couldn't be

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,789
fucked open Photoshop because you had no

26
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,039
passion at what you do thankfully for a

27
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,720
lot of content creators out there they

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,659
have friends loved ones and viewers who

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,069
will let them know how shitty their

30
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,080
content is there are many content

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,450
creators out there who don't receive any

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,009
negative feedback and they receive

33
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,679
nothing but thumb ups and positive

34
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,360
comments saying LMFAO do more please on

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,910
today's episode of content cop we're

36
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,739
gonna be looking at jinx reloaded

37
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,640
I mean reload it made too much sense of

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,890
what's called jinx reloaded let's start

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,379
things off with an education how to get

40
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,800
youtube famous

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,080
Oh apparently you get youtube famous by

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,700
promoting your shitty t-shirt in the

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:11,750
first five seconds of the video look at

44
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,940
this smug piece of shit just sits on his

45
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,280
bed in a bag of Cheetos as his intro oh

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,050
hell yeah dude it reminds me that

47
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,880
asshole who ate a bowl of cereal for a

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,980
million subs what I mean by scope out

49
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,350
your competition is basically check out

50
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,810
their channels see what they do or how

51
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,200
they do things now what I did was set my

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,930
goal to outdo everything they did sound

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,090
like a fucking legend jinx your goal was

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,410
to outdo everything the other reaction

55
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,240
channels were doing so you looked at the

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,970
finebros reaction channel you said yeah

57
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,800
i could do better than that i'll show

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,630
the video in its entirety rather than

59
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,160
just showing clips of it that's where

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
the finebros are fucking up maybe you

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,010
thought you're gonna outdo the other

62
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,720
reaction channels by improving your

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
video quality oh no no that's just gonna

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,710
stay at 720p I can't go any higher it

65
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,270
couldn't be fuck I uploaded four videos

66
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,500
a day you know how long it's gonna take

67
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,510
if it's 1080p I'll kill myself holy shit

68
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,650
he doesn't think he's out doing his

69
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,120
competition because his videos are

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,650
improving he thinks he's out doing his

71
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,910
competition because he has a different

72
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,160
backdrop every four videos don't

73
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,870
misunderstand me now I'm not talking

74
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,610
about his bedroom that all stays the

75
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,150
same what I'm talking about our bucket

76
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,910
hats this is the secret formula to

77
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,500
maintaining a positive like/dislike

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,230
ratio while producing terrible content

79
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,390
basically reaction channels can do

80
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,730
anything they want and people are going

81
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,160
to come see you know their personality

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,709
or their reactions to things I really

83
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,630
like the subtext there they're coming to

84
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,180
see the personality are the reactions to

85
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,709
things they're not coming to see the

86
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,110
video at all no that's not even that's

87
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,209
not even part of the puzzle if the video

88
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,160
wasn't there at all everyone would still

89
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,989
tune in that's why my personality

90
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,239
channels just fucking booming why where

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,340

92
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,959

93
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,150
Channel I literally came through and

94
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,620
reacted to anything it didn't matter

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,760
viral videos trailers

96
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,000
games oh damn we finally figured out how

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,549
he outdid everyone is because he stole

98
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,250
the content from everywhere

99
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,709
it didn't matter he stole it from the

100
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,530
vine compilations try not to laugh vine

101

this one is seven ways you know you're

134
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,199
in a black person's house household no

135
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,789
I've never been in a black person's

136
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,740
household because I'm a seven year old

137
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,419
boy who lives in South Dakota and the

138
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,520
only way I'm able to find content on

139
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
YouTube is through my favorite youtube

140
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,419
content aggregator jinx you'll never

141
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,239
hear the beep on the microwave

142
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:01,659
not today motherfucker to true us white

143
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,189
people love hearing the beep on the

144
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,719
microwave and I don't know if it's my

145
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,550
white skin that makes me love the

146
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,800
microwave beep or if it's my 1/64

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,809
Cherokee that loves the microwave beep I

148
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,189
can't quite figure it out but I know

149
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,709
that black people have that one unlock

150
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,619
black people never eat the as part of

151
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:19,419
the bread you know the two is they will

152
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,009
eat every piece of bread in there and

153
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,869
leave the ass farts in there

154
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:25,029
black people they won't eat the heel of

155
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,909
the bread but but everyone else we love

156
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,949
it we make our own meals out of it

157
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,869
that's just the heel meal that's what we

158
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:32,949
call it and we just cook in the

159
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,599
microwave and say you guys ready for the

160
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,369
heel meal you can start to see why is

161
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,110
more successful watching other people's

162
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,059
content than creating his own so far

163
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,289
what we've looked at I think is

164
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,059
completely forgivable I think a lot of

165
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,860
this stuff despite it being bad

166
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,599
that's what age does you look at

167
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,909
people's old videos it's bad you know

168
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,619
look at my old videos they're fucking

169
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,059
bad but now we're gonna look at some

170
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,059
content that's recent one of his series

171
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:57,669
this is top 10 series not really Santoro

172
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,089
top 10 it's closer to a WatchMojo top 10

173
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:09,039
- the commentary top 10 directors top 10

174
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,029
rappers top 10 actors - top 10 TV shows

175
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,979
if you think that's as bad as these

176
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,169
videos get well you're in for a treat

177
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,899
they get so much worse one of his more

178
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,029
recent creative endeavors is called a

179
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,119
parody interview it's an abomination of

180
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,479
him asking questions to song lyrics I'm

181
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,129
prepared to show you guys a very long

182
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,019
clip it's much longer than I normally

183
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,639
show you I normally show you a clip

184
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,740
that's one to two seconds just to give

185
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,169
you context and then I'd say a joke we'd

186
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,089
laugh hoo-ha the whole world works and

187
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,249
then we'd move on right but in this case

188
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:44,559
I think the whole thing is a joke so I'm

189
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,019
going to play it in its entirety right

190
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,409

191
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,629
