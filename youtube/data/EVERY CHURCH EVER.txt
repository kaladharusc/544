1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,020
And in the beginning, God 
created Heaven and Earth.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,740
My Dad said that
God's not real.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,580
And God's spirit moved
upon the face of the water.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,500
My Dad says that God's not real 
and the spirits aren't real either.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,580
And God said, &quot;Let
there be light!&quot;

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,120
Uh, how could he say that cause' if you think 
about it, language wasn't even invented yet.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,880
Thank you! - Okay, if you have something 
to say, remember to raise your hand.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,640
-Yes, Alfie? - Can I say it now?

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
- Yes. - God's not real.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,620
- Listen. Do not make this hard on me, all right? I already 
have enough trouble keeping these kid's attention!

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,700
- Perhaps something can sweeten the 
deal? - Okay. Here's some chocolate.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,900
Guys! God's real!

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,780
Oh my gosh, he's so 
freaking real! Oh my gosh!

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,580
They bought it!

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,580
Every. Church. Ever.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,740
[choir music]
&quot;Baptisms Then&quot;

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,420
You've been blessed.

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,160
[rock music]
&quot;Baptisms Now&quot;

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,460
Let's get ready
to baptize!

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,980
- Get dunked and get wet with the Jesus! 
- Get dunked and get blessed by the Jesus!

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,880
- Get dunked and get wet with the Jesus! 
Open up your faith, and let it blow into me!

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,300
- Get dunked and get wet with the Jesus! 
- Get dunked and get blessed by the Jesus!

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,300
- Get dunked and get wet with the Jesus! 
Open up your faith, and let it blow into me!

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:41,420
&quot;Every church, every church. Ever.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,800
Jesus Christ!

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,400
- Sir, do you have the 
time? - John 3:16.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,760
I want all of you to look
deep inside and ask yourself!

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,940
Am I holding hate
in my heart?

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,200
And if you are I want you to 
let it go. Like Frozen, just let it go!

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,400
- And instead of carrying 
hate.. - What do you want?

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,080
I want you to carry
God with you.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,020
So take this moment, right here right now, right 
here right now, and let God into your heart.

33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,980
Get away from me!

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,920
Don't touch people! Don't touch
people in church, right? Right?

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:38,160
That priest is hell cute!
Oh, I shouldn't say hell.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,220
Jesus Christ!

37
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,740
Glory.

38
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,959
I just don't understand how Jesus is the son 
of God if God didn't even have sex with Mary?

39
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,660
All right. Now dude. I know you've been in church before. 
But this is a little different because it's a black church.

40
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh, oh, yeah!
I know I got this.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Praise Jesus!

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,680
Oh hell no, Judas! 
You don't G O D.

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,160
Yeah, you know me! &quot;This little light of mine!&quot; 
Sing with me guys. &quot; I'm gonna let it shine!

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,620
Hallelujah! &quot;Let it
shine! Let it shine!&quot;

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,060
I feel the force, and I ain't 
talking about Star Wars, y'all!

46
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,700
Oh no, here it comes.

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,440
Yo, this not 
my white dude.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,060
Every. Church. Ever.

49
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:39,739
I would like you all to help me pray for my son, Robbie. 
He broke his leg and needs a speedy recovery.

50
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,900
That is so sad
for Little Robbie.

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,080
But I need your most sincere prayers for my son, 
Michael. Now Michael broke both his leg and arm. And..

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,860
he's blind in one eye.
He look like Getty Sap!

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,130
Well, I will be praying for both Robbie and Michael. I must 
remind you that I still need your prayers for my son,

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,580
Dennis, who was born
with no arms, no legs.

55
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,740
His skin's flaking off. He's cold all the time, and 
he's only expected to live to nine years old.

56
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,300
- Isn't Dennis your
pet snake? - Yes.

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Jesus Christ.

58
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,460
Glory!

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:44,000
Every. Church. Ever,
