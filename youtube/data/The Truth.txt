1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,799
the truth is all we have in life the

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,020
truth is the most important thing that

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,200
we could ever learn about ourselves

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,330
honesty is the only glue that keeps

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,179
together communities on the internet and

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,460
I want to talk about the truth because I

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,500
want to talk about why I make videos

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,810
like feeling down and if you've been

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,279
with my channel for a while you know

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,019
that videos like feeling down are not

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,779
uncommon because I'm the kind of guy

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,420
that wears his heart on his sleeve I

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,000
show my emotions at every turn because I

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,370
want to be honest not just with you guys

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,520
but with myself I want to be honest

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,980
because in that honesty I want people to

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,890
realize that doubting yourself is not

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,410
always a bad thing if you let it consume

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,969
your life of course if you doubt

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,559
yourself to the point of crippling

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,149
anxiety you're never gonna go anywhere

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,180
but doubting yourself means that you're

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,250
not so much of a fool that you're

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,600
walking forward thinking that you're

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
always right because if you think that

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,690
you're always right

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,449
you are more often wrong than right and

28
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,129
if you're moving through life with that

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,320
blind confidence you're never gonna go

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,710
anywhere

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,380
and no one's ever gonna trust you and I

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,760
know there's people that watch my videos

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
that have no interest in playing any

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,390
bigger role than just watching my videos

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,280
for entertainment value and that's fine

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,040
I try to make the best most entertaining

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,420
videos that I possibly can given the

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,009
time frame that I have in my life to do

39
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,990
them but also beyond that one of the

40
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,400
coolest thing that's ever come out of

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,259
this channel is the ability to be honest

42
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,180
with each other

43
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,250
the ability for me to talk to you guys

44
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,009
about my feeling at any given time and

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,740
be honest and not try to always put it

46
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,740
in a positive light there are times when

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,110
I have doubts about myself there are

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,119
times when you guys have doubts about

49
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,220
yourselves about each other about this

50
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,990
community about where we're going but

51
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,899
what always matters is that you trust

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,890
that we're always moving forward we're

53
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,180
always trying to make the world a better

54
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,130
place we're always trying to put forward

55
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,350
goodwill in the world we're always

56
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,380
trying to shrug off those doubts not

57
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,410
ignore them acknowledge them realize if

58
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,640
they're right or wrong

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
correct because of them and then move

60
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,160
forward in life no matter what no matter

61
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,750
what obstacles are coming your way

62
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,330
always moving forward and listen close

63
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,380
because this is very important we are

64
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,170
doing great things on this channel when

65
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,450
I came from a place of crippling

66
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,630
self-doubt I moved forward from that

67
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,750
doubt to a place where I can be proud of

68
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,170
the things that I have done and if I

69
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,020
leave anything behind in this world it

70
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,780
is the idea that that can come from

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,420
anywhere anyone can do what I have done

72
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,760
anyone can be the person that I have

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,910
become not a copy of myself but pushing

74
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,540
yourself to a higher place pushing

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,530
yourself to a better version of you

76
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,090
making sure that those doubts don't

77
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,709
bring you down don't cripple your

78
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,810
development don't make you move like

79
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,269
it's so afraid of moving forward and so

80
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,610
afraid of what people think of you that

81
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,940
you do nothing in your life that doesn't

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,090
mean that everybody will find success

83
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,769
but that does mean that everybody can

84
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,829
take the risks to develop themselves to

85
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,570
a place where they are proud of what

86
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,410
they can do that is what's important

87
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,120
about this channel that's what's

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
important about being honest with

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,010
ourselves that's what's important about

90
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,269
being honest with each other and that's

91
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,670
what I love about this channel that's

92
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,640
what I absolutely love about creating

93
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,260
things on the Internet

94
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,329
that's what I love about this community

95
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,799
and that doesn't mean that everything's

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,720
positive on the internet that doesn't at

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,070
all because there are shitty people who

98
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,660
discover that they are shitty people no

99
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,750
matter what they do and that's fine too

100
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,370
but it's our responsibility to try to

101
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,060
push humanity forward that's what I want

102
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,440
more of I want to see humanity go to

103
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,410
great places I want to see us live up to

104
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,320
our potential I want to see us move

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,130
forward into a brighter future i Macias

106
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,440
succeed in places that we doubt we can

107
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,330
go that's what I want that's what I've

108
