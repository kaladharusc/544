1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:32,670
jontron

2
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,469
hey Ken I was thinking about you know

3
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,210
maybe taking a year off going back to

4
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,910
college start my career dog fence Barbie

5
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,640
you stay at home having my kids John

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:55,020
what are you playing systemic oppression

7
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,290
the Barbie line of toys launched in 1959

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,420
and quickly became the desire of every

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,160
little girl who wouldn't want to look

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,890
like Barbie she's bright colorful fun

11
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,540
and likely hasn't eaten anything since a

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,970
moon landing in 1969 with those

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,440
proportions I think you're gonna be

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,210
needing one of these Barbie what

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,100
beautiful rims you had to upset the

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,500
sadness it only made sense that Mattel

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,850
would bring Barbie into the burgeoning

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,950
market of gaming her widespread appeal

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,800
was sure to sell starting with Commodore

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,040
64's Barbie aptly titled now I'm

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,540

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,490

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:12,370
at a perfect 10

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,769
well this was 1984 maybe this is just

35
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,099
what people thought videogames work I

36
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,139
can't move the car or do anything what's

37
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,739

see you in an hour what is this some

58
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,079
kind of Twilight Zone episode where

59
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,640
Barbie just keeps getting ready for

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,349
various dates with Ken when in reality

61
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,870
Ken died in a horrific yachting accident

62
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,840
that Barbie refuses to accept hello hi

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,140
Barbie it's Ken I miss you it's so quiet

64
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,099
after you die

65
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,530
there's nothing but the voices they

66
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,620
never stop see you in an hour okay so

67
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,510
what it turns out you have to do is get

68
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,370
into the right outfit which is very

69
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,560
specific for some reason and return home

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,989
before an hour passes so this game can

71
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,659
be summed up wholly as getting ready for

72
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,940
a date with Ken also if you ain't lookin

73
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,680
fine he ain't taking you nowhere you're

74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,019
going to McDonald's for dinner okay on

75
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,069
to the next one

76
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,049
ken your creepy Barbie you got to stand

77
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,220
up for yourself more and if I were a

78
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,959
small girl I'd probably never touch

79
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,180
videogames again after this next up is

80
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,430
Barbie for NES let's see if technology

81
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,830
improved the Barbie experience

82
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,020
Oh God what have you done to yourself

83
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,880
Barbie why is your hair the same color

84
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,470
as your skin oh god it looks like you're

85
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,640
made out of fried chicken

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,160
a glamorous quest full of fun magic and

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,200
adventure Barbie's a trademark Italian

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,030
copyright 9091 that one looks like

89
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,310
Mickey and that one looks like a cease

90
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,400
and desist so we find Barbie laying in

91
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,380
bed reading a book about mermaids which

92
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,120
apparently she loves as she literally

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,000
proclaims it tomorrow's a busy day I'm

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,620
having lunch at the soda shop going

95
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,480
swimming at the beach and meeting Ken at

96
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,290
the party tomorrow

97
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,100
poor sweet Barbie what a burden you

98
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,710
carry in this life of ours at least

99
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,780
you'll get some welcome respite in your

100
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,819
dreams

101
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,740
yeah never mind I'm getting stressed out

102
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,339
just looking at this cords this game is

103
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,080
a basic platformer you move left and

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,819
right with barbie and throw diamonds to

105
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,069
solve puzzles and avoid obstacles boy

106
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,080
she does not have much power behind that

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,150
throat well maybe if you ate a piece of

108
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,069
food now and again your muscles would

109
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,050
come back from atrophy and here we have

110
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,969
the terrifying first boss of this game a

111
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,860
giant cage of beach balls hell-bent on

112
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,900
destroying Barbie for some reason if you

113
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,550
pay this cat and diamonds it'll close

114
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,680
the hatch for you defeating the boss you

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,659
hit the nail on the head Barbie money

116
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:24,479
can solve any problem the next level

117
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,770
features an assortment of clothes

118
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,330
throwing themselves at Barbie in hopes

119
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,860
that she'll buy them shoes hats

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,839
pantyhose er maybe there's that bacon

121
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,520

want to feel your skin inside me

125
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,339
essentially this is a game about Barbie

126
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,289
dreaming about all the things she has to

127
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,149
do tomorrow instead of being a game

128
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,159
about Barbie doing all the things she

129
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,020
has to do tomorrow I think they were

130
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,969

137
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:07,589

138
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:09,449

156
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,080
NES but the platforming is incredibly

157
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,659
slow in fact they were both made by the

158
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:01,289

167
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,889
child at some point barbie super model

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,419
is know so well so what's going on here

169
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,520
Barbies in a posh restaurant drinking

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,530
wine and journaling but she's dreaming

171
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,360
about driving down Hollywood Boulevard

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,540
you know they say dream big but Barbie

173
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,370
you got a dream a little bigger than

174
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,490
that all right Hollywood Boulevard all

175
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,770
the favorites are here Hollywood Museum

176
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,500
vaguely Chinese Theater new I mean

177
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,960
what's really going on here anyway okay

178
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,040
there's some sort of funny business

179
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,710
going on what is her son need sunglasses

180
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,470
for yeah that's like a like a little

181
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,150
dang old dog walking himself down the

182
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,580
street stupid dog can't do that you know

183
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,169
on second thought he must be shielding

184
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,510
his eyes from Barbies pure star power or

185
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,590
maybe actually maybe it's just a

186
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,340
horrible pink Corvette come on the first

187
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,960
game I've run into is literally a

188
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,490
matching game where you just match

189
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,919
Barbie with magazine covers this is less

190
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,780
thrilling than around a bathroom sodoku

191
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,310
and at least during that I get to take a

192
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,890
shit back to driving not really sure

193
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,860
where I met it this time but oh shit

194
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,410
that's a hit-and-run but it's okay

195
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,640
forgive her you would have done the same

196
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,310
in her shoes because Barbie is terribly

197
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,120
late for walking practice this is just

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,669
walking you press a direction hit a

199
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,230
button and repeat this is game I have

200
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,710
seen game that this is not game so as it

201
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,750
turns out that is just a practice

202
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,390
minigame for the actual runway so if you

203
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,950
didn't memorize the walk pattern there

204
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,959
you won't be able to do it here the most

205
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,730
positive thing I can say about this game

206
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,290
is that it does not revolve around

207
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,430
getting ready for a date with Ken the

208
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,350
fuck am I looking at right now am I

209
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,670
looking at you dreaming about being at

210
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,350
the beach while you're at the fucking

211
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,880
beach do

212
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,100
do you know what a homeless person is

213
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,350
have you ever stepped foot outside of a

214
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,810
mansion before has anyone ever rounded

215
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,480
you oh I get it this must all be a dream

216
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,160
cuz I've been in LA for more than ten

217
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,480
minutes and I haven't seen one

218
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,490
hypodermic needle or used condom the

219
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,870
other game force Ness is Barbies

220
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,060
vacation adventure sounds promising

221
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,069
here you explore some of America's most

222
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:34,649
famous locations such as California

223
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,810
Florida Texas Iowa and what Wyoming well

224
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,220
that's literally America's least

225
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,860
populated state 50% of a population is

226
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,380
just hostile winds you know I'm being

227

hard on you Wyoming let's give you a

228
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:56,370
shot wow that was just as bad as I

229
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,110
thought it was gonna be each location

230
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,120
serves as a different minigame this one

231
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,860
turns into some sort of tent puzzle

232
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,290
outdoor adventure when you finally do

233
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,940
get to some platforming in this game

234
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,019
it's atrocious ah I can't even bland on

235
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,819
these platforms the edge distance

236
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,949
changes each time it can't make up its

237
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:14,610
mind

238
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,600

Country the signs with the arrows the

genie friends having a magical picnic

282
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,520
but a dark wizard is lurking in the

283
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,280
distance looking at de ass and being a

284
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,470
general creep in reality though what

285
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,150
this guy is doing is eyeing up their

286
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,760
genie lamps which is oddly not a sexual

287
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,980
euphemism and he's also got a big black

288
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,860
unicorn which actually is a sexual

289
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,020
euphemism you're already riding a

290
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,480
goddamn flying unicorn how much power do

291

one's actually pretty good you fly

293
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,450
around on your magic carpet through

294
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,370
mazes while collecting items and solving

295
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,140
puzzles all of this to restore your

296
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,390
friends magical powers but something

297
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,550
feels off here something's not right

298
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,190
no one's told me to change my dress or

299
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,890
to get ready for a date with Ken yet or

300
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,260
excuse me in this world he's Ken common

301
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,390
they made a PC version of this game as

302
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,620
well for some reason

303
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,050
comes with that stupid genie lamp I have

304
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,220
no idea how to use it

305
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,290
it's from the 90s it has some weird DVI

306
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,480
input I turned into a little boy and

307
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,350
went in here myself

308
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,340
oh I can't get in there now I'm a

309
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,420
grown-up ah looks like Barbie's coming

310
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,640

tanning salons and for Gucci stores and

313
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,480
the whole thing it's basically a classic

314
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,610
maybe this one will have something

315
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,680
Barbie horse adventures Blue Ribbon race

316

318
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,480
add this music this is the real music

319

323
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,550

they're giving out free stuff in there

347
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,460
Wow this is fascinating people used to

348
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,720
actually use these things before the

349
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,300
internet I shocked how was Barbie

350
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,020
created the concept for the original

351
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,060
Barbie was taken from a pre-existing

352
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,520
German doll known as Willy who was Lily

353
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,580
Lily was a sex doll marketed to adults

354
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,280
and smoked sharks as a joke gift this is

355

I knew Barbie had a secret past they

357
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,570
changed her name and identity to push

358
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,880
her evil sexy agenda I mean she's not

359
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,590
appropriate for children at all she's

360
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,570
just a ploy by the giant marketing

361
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,730
tycoons this is horrible

362
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,980
