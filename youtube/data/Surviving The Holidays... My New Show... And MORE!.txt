1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,460
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,080
YouTube boogie2988 coming at you live

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,400
was again through the power of the

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,109
Internet and this is my rambling series

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,610
it's my vlogging series which I just

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,380
talked about life the universe things

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,639
that are particularly interesting to me

8
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,139
it's a very self-indulgent video in

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,299
which I just pretty much talk about

10
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,180
stuff as from a friend to a friend and I

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,590
hope that you are that friend watching

12
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,970
this on your phone or your tablet or

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,890
your nice big television thank you for

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,449
tuning in and talking to me I'm gonna do

15
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,039
something very different for this

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
episode I'm gonna talk about a lot of

17
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,289
different stuff want to talk about my

18
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,060
podcast that I've been filming I want to

19
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,320
talk a little bit about my mental and

20
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,640
physical health I'll talk a little bit

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,170
about the holidays talk a little bit

22
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,180
about Black Friday and stuff like that

23
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,370
so hope you enjoy this topics before we

24
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,079
get started I am actually going to give

25
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,250
a shout out to one of my channel

26
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,840
sponsors and the reason I'm doing this

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,579
is because a lot of people have asked me

28
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,770
why did I swap headphones why am I using

29
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,809
different headphones in my videos you

30
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,579
guys don't know this I am a creature of

31
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,379
habit I used the exact same headphones

32
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,870
on YouTube for seven and a half years

33
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,780
and finally decided to upgrade and I

34
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,760
upgraded because these sponsors sent me

35
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,140
these headphones these are from the

36
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,370
folks of mass drop they're the sign

37
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,750
Heiser's I'm gonna put a link in

38
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,220
description box below if you want to

39
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,270
learn more about those headphones you

40
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,890
can click on that link and check it out

41
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,970
or stick around at the end of the video

42
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,860
and I'll talk about it quite a bit more

43
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,710
why I chose to do that for this video

44
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,509
but let's get right into the meat and

45
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,299
potatoes of this the holidays well we've

46
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,770
now gone through October we've gone

47
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,790
through Halloween and we've gone through

48
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,950
Thanksgiving and I did not lose any

49
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,840
weight during those holidays nor did I

50
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,490
gain any weight during those holidays

51
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,380
I'm sitting very healthfully very

52
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,290
happily at 350 pounds which is still a

53
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,970
hundred pounds heavier than I want to be

54
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,070
but I'm still I'm pretty comfortable if

55
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,350
I go through the holidays at 350 pounds

56
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,450
I think I'm okay with that I still have

57
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,150
a lot of weight left to lose so I

58
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,130
probably join you guys in the gym in

59
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,780
January and push just as hard as you

60
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,030
guys and see what happens but as it is

61
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,710
right now I think I won't put any weight

62
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,060
on during Christmas either I think we're

63
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,590
set right about three or 50 pounds looks

64
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,720
like my diet and exercise regimen has me

65
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
setting and right about 350 pounds which

66
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,049
means a lot of changes need to be made

67
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,460
but they're probably not getting made

68
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,509
during the holidays when everybody's

69
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,920
bringing over snacks and foods and and

70
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,659
there's millions of delicious things to

71
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,939
eat um now if you've ever struggled with

72
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,469
any mental health issues anxiety

73
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,610
depression that kind of thing you

74
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,160
probably hate the holidays or you know

75
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,209
if you don't have a family or something

76
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,500
like that you're probably those people

77
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,819
that hate

78
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,439
holidays I have to say that every

79
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,390
holidays the season that I've ever been

80
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,909
through has been challenging for me this

81
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,040
has been the least challenging of the

82
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,269
holiday seasons so far I really am

83
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,189
surprised by that you know it's been one

84
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,749
year since I separated from my ex-wife

85
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,180
and I thought this Thanksgiving was

86
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,260
gonna be very very tough

87
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,430
we still have Christmas to go and

88
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,780
Christmas is always the hardest one for

89
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,709
me I feel like but Halloween was

90
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,849
fantastic I just had an amazing

91
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,409
Halloween it was so much fun sharing

92
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,909
with my family and friends was so much

93
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:44,719
fun sharing with you

94
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,480
Thanksgiving on Thanksgiving Day I went

95
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,919
to the movies with friends I went and

96
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,569
hung out and saw a Ralph Rex in the

97
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,040
Internet or breaks the internet wherever

98
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
they called it oh they should have

99
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,980
called it Rex the Internet shouldn't

100
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,560
they've anyway it was okay movie and

101
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,519
spent a little bit more time with

102
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,590
friends and those Friday I filmed my

103
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,569
podcast episode episode 2 which went up

104
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,829
on the channel almost immediately

105
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,180
afterwards and we livestream that as

106
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,489
well then on Saturday I had friends

107
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,379
giving and I have like 25 people in my

108
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,629
home eating and just relaxing you know I

109
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,400
didn't take a single picture I didn't

110
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,889
film a single second of video and I

111
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,750
think maybe I took like two pictures and

112
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,370
put them on social media but I didn't do

113
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,629
what I would normally do was just film

114
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,090
everything photograph everything I just

115
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,620
was in the moment I just enjoyed the

116
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,650
moment and it felt really really good to

117
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,120
not involve the internet and that part

118
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
of my life as much as I normally would

119
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,750
and just kind of relax and just kind of

120
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,780
enjoy my friends and enjoy being out of

121
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,060
it and so I'm hoping Christmas will be

122
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,829
similar now there's still been plenty of

123
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,180
negative thoughts and negative issues

124
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,769
and negative patterns that my brain has

125
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,150
gone through and of course my brain is

126
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,430
like eat eat eat eat but obviously I

127
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,930
can't anymore because of that gastric

128
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,519
bypass surgery I'm at a point where I

129
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,290
can eat 3/4 of a plate of food and then

130
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:51,949
I'm done

131
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,889
so there's really only so much eating I

132
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,359
can do there's only so much damage I can

133
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,669
do I can always make an ass out of

134
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:00,049
myself on Twitter which I've been doing

135
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,030
pretty regularly but we'll talk about

136
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,290
that a little bit too I think in this

137
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,079
video um but the podcast so let's talk a

138
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,400
little bit about that some of your gonna

139
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,280
say boogie what podcast and that is

140
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,799
because the folks over at YouTube don't

141
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,139
seem to be pushing that very much on my

142
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,030
channel when I upload it we're getting

143
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,219
3040 thousand views which is incredible

144
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,079
incredible for a fledgling podcast

145
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,969
that's just starting out when it's just

146
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,320
three guys just sitting around without a

147
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,330
guest talking about video games I'm

148
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,680
amazed that we're getting 30

149
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,870
forty fifty thousand views per episode

150
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,270
and we've uploaded now two episodes I'll

151
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,860
link to those if you want you'll find

152
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,030
them here on the channel if you want

153
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,530
eventually they will make it to

154
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,000
SoundCloud eventually they will make it

155
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
iTunes maybe they'll make it to Spotify

156
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,360
we still haven't even titled the dang

157
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,949
thing but if you have had a chance to

158
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,940
listen to those let me know what you

159
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,050
think if you haven't had a chance to

160
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,580
listen to them I hope that you consider

161
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,130
doing it it just looks like YouTube is

162
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,720
not even offering the thumbnail very

163
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,220
frequently I now have like impressions

164
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,229
data and it's saying I think because I'm

165
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,910
using the term podcast it doesn't think

166
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,199
people in this channel are interested in

167
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,699
a podcast on this channel so it's just

168
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,220
barely giving it a third or a quarter of

169
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,419
the impressions that it would normally

170
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:05,840
give a video that I upload it's fine

171
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
it'll either work itself out or along

172
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,370
the plan currently with this podcast is

173
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,380
to create its own channel to create its

174
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,530
own twitch channel once we have a name

175
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,849
to create its own bank account its own

176
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,110
business account the whole nine yards

177
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,400
split the revenue with my friends own

178
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,870
those you are watching that podcast

179
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,699
thank you so much once again the reason

180
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,710
I've decided to do that it is to focus

181
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,840
on helping job creation um to help my

182
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,070
friends make a little bit of money and

183
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,229
get them into this so if you like my

184
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,300
friends supporting that podcast is a

185
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,340
great way to do it it's also keeping me

186
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,440
busy throughout the the season we still

187
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,880
have like no sponsors or anything for

188
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,380
the podcast eventually we will get to

189
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,940
that point and when we do I'm excited to

190
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,370
do it but it's kind of nice just doing

191
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,780
it for fun right now it's kind of nice

192
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,470
just to have a new project to worry

193
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,810
about so another thing I wanted to talk

194
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,020
to you guys about and I know hate on the

195
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,470
Internet is really weird right now

196
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,479
people despise it when you talk about

197
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,030
mental health now people despise it when

198
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,699
you talk about specifically what I do

199
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,810
but it seems like everybody in general

200
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,490
you know I seen a lot of youtubers like

201
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,580
come out as anti they don't believe that

202
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,139
depression exists they don't believe

203
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,150
that anxiety exists they don't believe

204
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,800
that a person can have that and they

205
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,539
they don't believe all of this crazy

206
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,759
stuff so I always am a little hesitant

207
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,500
to bring those topics up anymore because

208
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,909
the criticism is so unfair and wild and

209
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,830
bizarre but the reality of it is it's

210
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,509
always been a part of my life if you

211
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,860
followed my channel for the last seven

212
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,150
years you'll know that it's something

213
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,349
I've talked about since the beginning of

214
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:34,580
time it's something I'll talk about to

215
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,310
the end of time I and I think the time I

216
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,830
let these angry bitter people who

217
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,160
don't understand mental health um

218
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,200
dissuade me from talking about something

219
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,880
I want to talk about more importantly

220
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,430
that I need to talk about is a day I

221
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,050
don't deserve this channel anymore so I

222
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,520
think I'm gonna go ahead and continue to

223
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
talk about it as you guys know I started

224
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,180
therapy again and my therapist has been

225
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,160
actually really really useful one of the

226
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,530
things we've talked about and I think

227
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,550
it's helped a lot during this holiday

228
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,690
season I think one of the things we've

229
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,090
talked about is learning to not pay as

230
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,960
much attention to the the negativity and

231
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,190
I'll tell you what's been surprising

232
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,720
about that is he brought up a really

233
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,010
interesting point it's like look if I

234
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,390
had 4.5 million patients how many of

235
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,620
those patients would think I was not a

236
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
good person how many of those patients

237
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,860
would not have been a good fit how many

238
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,630
mistakes that I have made during therapy

239
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,400
and I'm like yeah I guess it makes a lot

240
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
of sense right it's like what you got

241
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,690
4.5 million followers you know a lot of

242
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,950
those people are going to be rubbed the

243
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,120
wrong way a lot of those people are not

244
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,380
going to be interested in the thing that

245
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,990
you say and you have to learn to not

246
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,790
focus on those people and I'm like so I

247
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,140
should focus on the people who love the

248
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,980
thing they're like nope

249
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,330
sometimes those are the people that are

250
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,370
the most passionate and they can also be

251
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,410
the quickest to turn against you so you

252
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,060
should probably focus on the people who

253
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,250
don't say anything who just watch your

254
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,070
content enjoy you and I thought a lot

255
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,450
about that those of you still have to

256
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,010
say positive things to say I read that

257
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,050
positive stuff and it helps a lot I also

258
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,730
read the negative stuff and it hurts a

259
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,160
lot I think moving forward I'm just

260
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,430
going to focus on my own opinion my own

261
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,560
feelings my own thoughts and I think

262
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,730
from time to time I will see something

263
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,110
negative and I'll try to use that as

264
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,670
constructive criticism I think from time

265
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,080
to time I'll see something positive and

266
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm going to use that to help build me

267
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,710
up but for the most part I think I'm

268
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,570
just gonna do what I want I think I'm

269
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,890
just gonna say what I want I think I'm

270
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,240
just gonna do what I want and I'm not

271
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,790
really gonna give much consideration to

272
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,560
public consumption I'm not gonna give

273
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,930
much consideration to whether people

274
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,660
going to like it or not if doing a

275
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,190
podcast feels good I'll do it and if

276
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,320
people watch it that's great if creating

277
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,700
a rambling video feels good I'm gonna

278
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,380
make it and if people watch it that's

279
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,860
great

280
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,780
if people hate it that's also great

281
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,210
they're still watching they're still

282
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,920
contributing to the YouTube algorithm

283
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,870
they're still dropping a comment and

284
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,190
saying something hateful they're still

285
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,720
dropping a dislike which counts as an

286
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,260
interaction it still helps so even if I

287
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,189
create content that these people the spa

288
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:59,160
relevancy is relevancy you know Stockton

289
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,360
Hakeem started the other day who I do

290
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,309
talk to on a personal level every once

291
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,749
in a while and I'm like you know I worry

292
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:05,339
about this I worry about that I worry

293
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,720
about this like what are some youtuber

294
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,369
makes some big hit peace video to me

295
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:09,569
he's like boogie that could be one of

296
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,649
the nicest things that could ever happen

297
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,179
to I'm like why cuz cuz you could use

298
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,209
the relevancy again and that's kind of

299
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,980
sad but it's kind of true he's you know

300
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,059
he's like if I were you I'd be more

301
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,800
controversial I would be more polarizing

302
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,470
I would do crazier stuff well I don't

303
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,720
know I don't know isn't necessarily that

304
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,089
that is the the right direction for my

305
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,529
mental health I don't know that's the

306
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,529
right direction for my personal choice

307
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,300
but I see where he's coming from here's

308
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,519
what I want to do I want to create fun

309
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,649
goofy videos that make me feel good that

310
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,869
make you feel good and sometimes I want

311
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,670
to talk about an important topic about

312
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,160
co-existing about getting along about

313
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,689
learning to love each other about

314
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,100
learning to love your neighbor about

315
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,110
learning to take care of agent Lee I

316
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,730
want to defend this video game industry

317
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,559
of ours our video game hobby of ours and

318
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,029
defend developers and event players

319
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,100
alike sometimes I'm gonna do that too

320
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,679
and and and and sometimes I'm going to

321
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,089
make a video like this that's self

322
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,429
indulgent and talk about myself and talk

323
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,889
about my mental health and people can

324
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,360
criticize it as much as they want and

325
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,189
sure I'll make mistakes because I'm

326
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:09,689
certainly not a perfect person I'm

327
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:13,079
pretty far from perfect but I do enjoy

328
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,790
making this kind of content and you guys

329
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,920
seem to enjoy watching it and I'm done

330
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,540
listening to the people who don't sorry

331
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,230
sorry I know that's one of the most

332
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,309
offensive things you can say to those

333
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,170
people because they want to be important

334
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,249
they want to be relevant they want to

335
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:31,410
exist in your brain sorry for those guys

336
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,939
so I think it's pretty much gonna wrap

337
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,470
it up I gotta tell you this for those

338
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,449
who do continue to support me I will

339
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,829
continue to listen as often as I can

340
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:40,769
helpfully healthfully do so and for

341
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,299
those of you choose to watch silently

342
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,040
and never leave a comment and never

343
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,839
leave a like and never involve yourself

344
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,189
you just watch and you're just a number

345
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,019
in that little bar that says you know

346
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,819
108 109 it's the only feedback I get

347
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,920
from you let me know I want to let you

348
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,449
know I'm gonna focus on that feedback

349
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,910
because that feedback is super important

350
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,069
because it's the one that pays the bills

351
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:01,350
all right so let me talk you a little

352
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,879
bit about these headphones and then

353
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,290
we'll be done but for those you don't

354
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,370
want to hear about it guys thanks for

355
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,959
watching I love you very much and I'll

356
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,920
speak with you again soon

357
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,359
now stick around because watching this

358
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,829
ad will help me on a lot so these

359
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,420
headphones got sent to me by one of the

360
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,799
new sponsors to the channel the folks

361
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,359
over at mass drop and there's a link

362
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,129
here down below and there's also a link

363
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,239
in the description box below if you want

364
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,859
to check out these headphones these are

365
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,170
the new sign Heiser's I think the HD 58

366
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,720
X and oh boy let me tell you something

367
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,579
as soon as I tried these on I knew these

368
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,169
are gonna be my new headphones it wasn't

369
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,179
just because I like the way they look on

370
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,529
camera or the way they look on my head I

371
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,419
think they look fantastic but it was

372
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,160
also because of this sound quality the

373
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,439
sound quality is insane let's just be

374
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,669
honest a lot of us buy cheap headphones

375
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,679
a lot of us buy cheap earbuds because

376
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,019
we're cheap but if you're willing to

377
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,429
invest a little bit of money in a high

378
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,410
quality set of headphones you will

379
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,999
realize exactly what you're missing

380
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,709
you're not listening to the videogames

381
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,939
you're not listening to the music you're

382
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:52,739
not listening to sound the way it was

383
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,660
meant to sound when you put on high

384
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,889
quality headphones you'll finally

385
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,269
realize what you're missing and trust me

386
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,980
you will never want to go back I

387
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,779
certainly do not want to go back but the

388
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,220
reason the water was by the inexpensive

389
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,509
headphones is because we can't afford

390
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,829
three or four hundred dollars for

391
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:06,899
headphones and I understand that that's

392
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,759
why I went with this particular sponsor

393
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,509
