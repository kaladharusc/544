254
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,200
we did you do there is a pet in the

255
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,500
cloud of dirt yeah I saw this yeah

256
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,940
why did you see you saw it but you

257
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,230

258
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,700
troll is it yeah there is a pet inside

259
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,990
usually how the pet did you find that

260
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:36,680

261
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,450
I like scripting my my life I got legit

262
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,400

263
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,170
the inventory upgrade what does that do

264
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,230
oh that's good that's good it gives you

265
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,660
a crafting table inside of your menu I

266
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,270
do things I think that's what it is do

267
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,730
anything further away from the house now

268
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,730
there is one key hey Ben wanted some of

269
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,060
them so he can have all of them now he

270
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:08,420
wanted one about $5,000 yeah actually to

271
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,180
be toast

272
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,200
why do you TNT their base yeah

273
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,290
probably isn't the smartest idea yeah to

274
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,550
be honest in this modpack

275
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,350
all right I'm gonna open some loot box

276
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,320
bags but I'll give something edgy to

277
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,090
because he's probably behind the thing

278
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,690
so what is this what is this a lucky

279

to make sure they know deadlocks is the

283
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,060
