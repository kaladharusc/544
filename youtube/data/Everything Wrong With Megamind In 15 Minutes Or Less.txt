2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,360
this forty second long epic DreamWorks

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,010
logo is unnecessarily epic and

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,200
unnecessarily DreamWorks he is my day so

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,779
far aeration my end starts at the

6
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,130
beginning starting with the climax

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,810
cliche coincidentally starting with the

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,550
climax is the working title for my sex

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,739
tape coming soon is the alternate title

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,860
here is your minion even non minion

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,619
minions now make me cringe you are dest

12
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:33,010
I didn't quite hear that last part but

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,200
it sounded important how does make a

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,699
mind even remember this in such detail

15
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:37,989
does this race have a photographic

16
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,850
memory from conception because honestly

17
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,320
the ramifications for that are a bit

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,999
unsettling sure the gravitational pull

19
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,469
of that black hole type thingy is enough

20
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,149
to be pulling that entire planet in at

21
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,920
an astonishing rate but an escape pod

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,050
the size of an infant I no worries it's

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,489
definitely gonna break free so they're

24
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:52,870
just gonna keep the baby in the prison I

25
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,309
guess in this world wherever a baby pops

26
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:55,839
up is where he or she is forced to live

27
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,489
coyote cares the equivalent of squatter

28
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,019
rights in the Mega Man universe also

29
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,089
they had flash cards at this prison how

30
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,469
many babies do they take in this is a

31
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,360
very dark society mr. Bokka hanging out

32
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,340
here eating humans as well is there that

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,290
I once again ran into mr. goody

34
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,510
two-shoes I know right it's almost as if

35
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,710
the unlikely convenience of your

36
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,420
continued childhood interaction is meant

37
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,920
to serve as some sort of story plot lot

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,360
of popcorn containers and movies act

39
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,920
like popcorn fire hydrants waiting to

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,390
spray across rooms like some sort of

41
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,850
curl based confetti cannon I get the

42
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,170
kids can be cruel but this teacher

43
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,310
should be fired immediately

44
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,420
letting a student dole out the

45
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,890
punishment allowing this to be the class

46
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,600
picture not involving all the students

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,740
in the crucial itsy bitsy spider

48
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,230
sing-along no matter how hard I tried I

49
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,260
was always the odd man out the last one

50
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,390
picked trouble child becomes even more

51
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,770
trouble than evil due to being the last

52
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,240
one picked for school sports cliche

53
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,400
also if you want to gang up on some kid

54
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
and throw dodgeballs at him there really

55
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
isn't a need to pick teams unless this

56
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,290
is a new dodgeball variant I'm unaware

57
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,590
was this my destiny hold on I would

58
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,030
think inventing something like this at a

59
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,950
young age would be a ton more impressive

60
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,360
than being stronger than everyone else

61
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,060
being bad is the one thing I'm good at

62
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,460
but has he been bad Megamind didn't do

63
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,840
anything to end up in prison he just

64
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,130
landed there and was raised by the

65
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,930
inmates and so far he's just made a few

66
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,310
harmless inventions and been picked on

67
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,269
by kids at school

68
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,010
sounds not too far off from a normal

69
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,599
life in the suburbs to me if I know the

70
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
law of inertia and I probably don't

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,900
unless those kids somehow buckled in

72
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,340
that rod there will be a lot of unhappy

73
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,230
parents of some very bruised up kids

74
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,670
after that unauthorized field trip

75
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,709
waiting I decided to pick something a

76
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,540
little more humble also we now enter

77
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,190
minute six of this bloated opening

78
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,200
exposition I swear if this wolf aeration

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,700
goes on much longer I may be the one who

80
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,049
goes full supervillain this is an

81
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,159
awfully big city for one of the

82
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,420
headlines on the front page of the local

83
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,280
paper to simply be shopping you're a

84
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,530
villain and you'll always be a villain

85
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,840
you'll never change and you'll never

86
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,299
leave your fun Megamind would be

87
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,519
diabolical at cinemasins also I wonder

88
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,290
if it was JK Simmons voice work here is

89
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,819
the law enforcement officer that got him

90
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,230
the role barely appearing as James

91
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,780
Corden in the DCU movies also also how

92
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,160
exactly are they talking to each other

93
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,780
that appears to be a steel door with a

94
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,790
glass plated window if they screamed at

95
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,170
each other they could maybe make out a

96
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,579
few words but they certainly wouldn't be

97
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,780
able to carry on a conversation like

98
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,540
this you were right I'll always be a

99
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,690
villain oh good

100
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,099
can't pass up those on the nose song

101
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,109
choices we're bad moon rising or the

102
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,879
boys are back in town not available also

103
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,409
he gives the guards at least a few more

104
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,760
seconds to take him down are they

105
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,140
required by law to listen to a villain

106
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,099
spawn before taking action why would

107
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,450
Metro City go through the trouble of

108
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,340
putting together a wall for Metro Man to

109
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,720
punch through if he's being honored he's

110
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,709
clear he's been around for a minute

111
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,329
saving people's lives and all those

112
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,349
people have seen him punch through walls

113
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,790
this is a lot of overhead for a

114
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,590
two-second bit Metro man cares not for

115
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,299
your puny human concepts like safety

116
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:35,859
parental consent or shaken baby syndrome

117
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,959
and I love you random citizen and I'm

118
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,069
going to show you this by splashing

119
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,329
every single one of you with a ton of

120
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,950
water like you were at a Shamu show down

121
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,660
at SeaWorld seriously I know they came

122
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,099
out the same year but this scent

123
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,870
despicable me are the same movie how did

124
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,430
this even happen two animated films

125
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,930
based on the villains viewpoint is very

126
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,280
fucking specific it's not like these

127
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,109
were just two movies about volcanoes or

128
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:01,769
Steve Prefontaine you call this

129
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,120
even if she did know the alligator thing

130
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,319
was gonna happen those are fucking

131
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,909
alligators and they are jumping two

132
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,939
inches from her face behind your plans

133
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,890
never work but he never closed the floor

134
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,810
right so there are still alligators

135
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,220
underneath rocks and while she's being

136
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,510
schmuck mice know I'm concerned about

137
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,430
these alligators Metrocity appears to be

138
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,930
a fairly large place but how many

139
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,340
abandoned observatories could there be

140
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,820
this dome is obviously lined with copper

141
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,050
copper drains my powers your weakness is

142
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,180
copper aside from not being a funny joke

143
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,949
how has this not come up once in the

144
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,090
whole time they've been battling each

145
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,020
other even though this ends up being

146
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,400
straight subterfuge it should have been

147
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
easy enough to prove false do they not

148
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,060
have pennies in Metro City wait a second

149
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,410
they're in Michigan and by the looks of

150
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,880
this laser pointer they're firmly mid

151
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,770
mitten and away from Lake Michigan last

152
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,240
I checked Cadillac area wasn't on the

153
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,039
coast as all the outside shots make it

154
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,780
appear to be also if they landed at

155
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,710
Christmas so I'm guessing the

156
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,000
environment here would have contained a

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,229
bit more winter weather than we're

158
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,060
seeing on these arrival shots believe me

159
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,500
I've been to Michigan in the winter it's

160
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
so cold there it makes the relationship

161
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,740
between Drake and push a tu look warm if

162
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,080
bi did it make a mine means he committed

163
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,150
brutal murder then yeah I guess he can

164
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,340
did it get dark ass kids movie wait that

165
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,699
worked

166
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,740
Megamind isn't holding any weapons he's

167
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,890
just walking toward the crowd

168
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,389
[Music]

169
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,800
why did the Minnie Riperton song even

170
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,520
start playing

171
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,110
that's a tape deck with one cassette

172
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,669
tape in it and highway to hell wasn't

173
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,990
finished so it should have just kept

174
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,129
belting out ac/dc

175
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,749
even if minion can't stop it movie

176
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:34,740
doesn't even know how to boombox

177
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,110
correctly I'm sure we'd all like to know

178
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,719
what you plan to do with us and this

179
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,219
city I'm not sure I understand why

180
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,080
anyone is even remotely concerned no one

181
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,159
seems afraid of mega mine

182
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,749
Roxanne wasn't even concerned after she

183
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,520
realized mega mine at trick Metro man

184
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,990
and he wouldn't be saving her the most

185
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:59,669
terrified by six mega mine oh that sir

186
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,759
is called a window how does micro mind

187
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,559
not even know what a window is he had

188
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,479
them in his school in his car and yes

189
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,249
even in his evil lair this ignorance is

190
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,749
not only unrealistic it's not even that

191
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:16,979
funny then why do I feel so manly the

192
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,509
running joke of mega Minds inability to

193
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,949
pronounce certain things is harshing my

194
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,719
mellow man melancholy and Metro City

195
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,189
have zero in common other than they

196
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:24,509
start with M and had the same number of

197
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,039
syllables if you make Metro City one

198
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,479
word but they sound different and they

199
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,830
have different inflections also he

200
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,509
pronounces Metro man right so why would

201
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,370
he say Metro City incorrectly shouldn't

202
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,499
be Metro Man I don't know how I don't

203
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,180
really feel like being around a bunch of

204
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,589
people no no that's the best part it'll

205
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,550
just be like you and me

206
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,810
nothing like including a bunch of sexual

207
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,909
preditor jokes in a kids movie battles

208
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,999
we will now never have why is she just

209
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:45,899
now hearing this

210
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,099
apparently the acoustics on this

211
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,539
observation deck of a keen sense of

212
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,959
dramatic timing I have no purpose but

213
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,120
Metro City isn't the only city right so

214
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,680
there are other cities to conquer and

215
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,089
other heroes to fight Megamind could

216
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,219
easily set up shop in Akron or Chicago

217
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,490
or even Cleveland how does Roxanne hunt

218
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,479
Bernards personal cell phone number but

219
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,009
he had taken up residence in the city's

220
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,599
Capitol building right so he shouldn't

221
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,889
be that hard to find I'll call you

222
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,490
tomorrow

223
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,439
partner even though I'm not gonna offer

224
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,999
you a ride home after saving me and

225
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,319
letting me know you walked here since we

226
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,909
now know we're in Michigan we also know

227
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:19,139
that the station call letters are

228
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,149
impossible all broadcasters east of the

229
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,559
Mississippi River are required to use a

230
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:26,099
W at the beginning like w m CP w jr

231
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,019
or w i am i still watchin this discount

232
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,430
despicable mean

233
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,070
I am your father is it a sin that Will

234
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,510
Ferrell is doing Brando better than

235
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,910
Brando and a B animated film I think it

236
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,040
is that's how to point Oh ships his gaze

237
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,510
to appear like he's looking at himself

238
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,400
carrying Roxanne now might be a good

239
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,050
time to remind the movie that this is

240
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,790
not how mirrors work his new line of

241
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,990
sight wouldn't even be anywhere near

242
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:56,730
that mirror did he grow even more on his

243
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,860
way down cuz if that crop top is average

244
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,840
width and length pal is now about 13

245
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,580
feet tall with a shoulder width of at

246
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,050
least 6 feet look I know it's a cartoon

247
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,340
and all but can we at least keep some

248
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,350
semblance of consistency why is this Jim

249
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,240
scoreboard on and more importantly why

250
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,010
is it 3 to 2 with 10 minutes and 40

251
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,660
seconds left after the tragic death of

252
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,340
metro man wouldn't continuing to use his

253
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,260
image on advertising be a bit tacky to

254
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,340
time needs to get there together okay

255
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,290
now you tell one how is Megan mind able

256
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,000
to Clark Kent Roxane like this she's

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,560
been kidnapped by Megamind many many

258
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,330
times and has heard him speak he has a

259
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,130
very distinct voice she doesn't find it

260
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,900
odd at all that Bernard sounds just like

261
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,170
him

262
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,490
or at the very least sounds nothing like

263
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,720
he did when she ran into him the first

264
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,220
time the back of this book is clearly

265
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,540
from a book called the happiest mean I

266
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,370
can be it doesn't show up until much

267
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,810
later in the movie it's almost like the

268
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,920
movie didn't think I'd have a pause

269
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,600
button on my remote I was always the

270
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,550
last one picked for everything hmm it's

271
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,140
too bad that we didn't go to the same

272
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,700
school yeah and then you could have made

273
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,930
fun of him along with everyone else

274
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,050
what's the T stand for Titan Titan or

275
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,520
Titan I know it seems like a silly

276
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,260
question but if you check the credits

277
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,210
and this joke it appears to be Titan but

278
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,250
this moment clearly says Titan and the

279
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,870
subtitle is actually switch from one to

280
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,680
the other about halfway through

281
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,570
considering Titan is just plain silly

282
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,280
we're gonna use Titan from here on out

283
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,780
and just blame the movie for its lack of

284
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,400
clarity either way here's an extra 5

285
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,900
sins movie just for making us have to

286
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,640
explain all that nonsense there's this

287
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,530
really really good-looking one I've got

288
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,630
my eye on currently okay fine his

289
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,190
superhero power has come with built-in

290
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,900
zoom and enhance but there is no way the

291
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,160
city park is in a direct line of sight

292
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
from Roxanne's apartment on the 20th

293
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,430
floor this high rocks on the count of

294
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,700
three on chief Jarrell oh it's one of

295
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,750
those superhero parties who you really

296
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,490
are not to mention you presumably

297
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,870
murdered two of the most important men

298
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,460
in their life you knew this car was

299
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,020
there you were just running around at

300
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,520
ten seconds ago does making something

301
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,630
invisible also

302
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,130
from memory like some sort of Eternal

303
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,900
Sunshine of the Spotless Megamind let me

304
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,710
make it clear

305
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,710
code I don't need you that movie has

306
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,810
time for this pointless conflict no I'm

307
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,330
so close I can feel it why is she

308
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,560
hanging all this stuff from the ceiling

309
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,450
at modern-day investigative reporters

310
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,980
traded in the evidence board for the

311
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,630
evidence mobile good thing Roxanne's

312
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,220
revelation coincided with the exact

313
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,810
moment all 200 pieces of paper were

314
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,400
facing the right direction that sure

315
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,680
seems convenient also what is even going

316
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,540
on here didn't she put these here and

317
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,640
they just happen to do this and why does

318
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,440
it even matter that she sees this but I

319
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,020
have powers though I'm not sure the

320
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,460
movie has done anything up to this point

321
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,080
but paint Shallow Hal is a borderline

322
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,310
sociopathic stalker

323
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,470
um how the if she's supposed to get down

324
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,210
from there I'm sure the movie will gloss

325
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,770
over any kind of explanation of how this

326
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,210
happens I just have her on the ground at

327
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,980
some point doing reporter things it's

328
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,480
this easy for someone to touch the watch

329
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,250
and ruin mega Minds disguise why

330
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,420
wouldn't he just put it somewhere else

331
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,340
on his body where it can't be as easily

332
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,220
reached you destroyed Metro Man you took

333
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,120
over the city

334
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,860
murdered Metro man is what he actually

335
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,780
did everyone seems to be tiptoeing over

336
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,310
that even though it's the inciting

337
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,200
incident do you really think that I

338
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,020
would ever be with you no and neither do

339
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,730
I which is why the end of this movie is

340
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,050
going to feel so false when she

341
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,640
eventually does ride the blue wave that

342
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,780
is where all this forced emotion is

343
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,640
going right this is a populous city and

344
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
we just saw a lot of people at the

345
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,370
restaurant so why are there zero people

346
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,380
or cars out the streets did Metro City

347
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,370
think there'd be a Batman vs Superman

348
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,960
fight downtown but other than Roxanne no

349
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,120
one knows who Titan is right so this was

350
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,500
a weird way to begin the charade the

351
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,970
oldest trick in the book is a guy in a

352
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,410
black mamba suits tearing a robot

353
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,760
tapping you on the shoulder that is

354
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,650
super specific this random billboard

355
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,570
seems unnecessarily Doublemint on dirt

356
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,040
for a kid's movie takes me back to the

357
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,570
good old days when animators would draw

358
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,220
mermaid buildings that look like dicks

359
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,260
[Music]

360
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,240
the driver of that gas truck is most

361
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,310
certainly dead so in Roxanne said she

362
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,440
might know a place she meant his pink

363
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
super layer why didn't she just lead

364
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,890
with that hey oh good a twist

365
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,090
I was hoping movie would throw another

366
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,830
plotline into this already tangled mess

367
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,240
up a story the split with minion the

368
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,830
romance with Roxy Titan going full

369
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,450
villain and now this I can't decide

370
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,980
which one of these boring plot lines I'm

371
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,870
least interested to see resolved using

372
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,270
my SuperSpeed I decided to go clear my

373
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,710
head if Metro man has this kind of

374
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,540
SuperSpeed doesn't that mean Titan does

375
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,340
as well if so why didn't he use it in

376
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,680
his fight with mega mind Metro man was

377
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,950
finally dead an music man was born oh

378
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,750
you've got trouble right here in Metro

379
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,980
City with a capital T and that rhymes

380
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,600
with P and that stands for put me out of

381
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,670
my misery already thousands have already

382
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,920
fled the city in a mass exodus but mega

383
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,720
man had taken over the city before Titan

384
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
didn't no one try to leave then oh and

385
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,750
just so you don't get cold feet and that

386
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,160
was the day that Metro City was saved by

387
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,030
the power of blue balls

388
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,370
there is no Easter Bunny there is no to

389
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,420
ferry spoiler alert where did all these

390
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,920
extra brain BOTS come from were they

391
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,510
hanging out with all Tony Starks extra

392
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,490
suits from Iron Man 3 Megaman clearly

393
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,540
graduated with honors from the

394
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,950
Prometheus school of driving away from

395
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,040
things know it's possible that Megamind

396
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,960
that turned over a new leaf for good but

397
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,580
why does Roxanne care he's kidnapped her

398
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,930
many times in the past and created a

399
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,310
false identity so she would fall in love

400
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,630
with him this is the most serious case

401
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,950
of Stockholm Syndrome I've ever seen

402
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,070
represented in an animated film so

403
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,600
you're the punk I've heard about even

404
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,100
animated superhero movies from seven

405
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,720
years ago just couldn't resist the sweet

406
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,370
sweet nectar of finishing the movie with

407
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,720
a super hero battling essentially a

408
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,760
different version of himself surprise

409
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,580
he's the real hero wait what

410
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,980
so minion has been mega mine for how

411
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,660
long and in the real Megaman has just

412
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,010
been biding his time waiting to appear

413
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,600
as Metro Man why is that something that

414
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,610
you would wait to reveal also now that I

415
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,020
think about it when did he even copy

416
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,130
Metro Man with the watch

417
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,120
not like he had time to do anything

418
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,350
between prison and trying to save

419
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,600
Roxanne pretty sneaky sis that one's for

420
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,830
all the youngsters who were just waiting

421
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,450
for an early 80s connect for commercial

422
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,590
reference your patience has been

423
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,510
rewarded there's only one person I know

424
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,790
who calls this time atrocity nice catch

425
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,620
Titan good thing you went ahead and flew

426
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,940
away scared and then waited a few

427
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,900
minutes to return with this knowledge

428
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,720
the script writers thank you

429
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,700
that's right the entire climax turns on

430
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,110
a character seeing the invisible car

431
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,150
from a distance no debris revealing it

432
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,950
or anything like that just an invisible

433
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,570
object that is supposedly spot able from

434
00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:00,640
a hundred feet away you couldn't set

435
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
that any faster Roxanne maybe just

436
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,270
Megamind turn around maybe save the

437
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,680
sentimental crap for pillow talk later

438
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,840
there's a benefit to losing you get to

439
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,640
learn from your mistakes you can't have

440
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,710
it both ways movie how can both Roxie

441
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,570
and the blue buffoon see this car but

442
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,180
Titan not know what's even there so this

443
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,080
is how it ends

444
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:23,230
I wish Oh lo me trick but quick question

445
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,760
if you had the dehydration gun this

446
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,770
whole movie why not just dehydrate Titan

447
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,080
at some point think about bad guys they

448
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,160
always tell that to Keyser Soze the good

449
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,970
guys now code I guess we are cope this

450
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,680
running code gag should have ended 40

451
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,860
minutes ago except Megamind is

452
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,750
responsible for all of this but pain

453
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,010
let's just celebrate him and hope he

454
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,320
doesn't cup again combine those 88

455
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,390
consecutive life sentences short of a

456
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,310
memory does this city have also isn't he

457
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,720
still the primary suspect in the murder

458
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,640
of Metro Man I mean we know he's alive

459
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,460
