9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,990

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,510
let's just let's just say a certain

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,640
certain youtuber has been gone for a few

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,780
years is is now back and it's absolutely

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,020
crazy because I knew he was gonna make

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,540
this video and that that that one person

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,370
that youtuber has been gone for just a

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,530
few years you might know him he was in

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,960
teen crafted he's one of my one of my

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,680
best internet friends a settled sorcerer

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,170
yes he is he's back on YouTube he

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,550
uploaded a video I believe five four or

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,890
five days ago I something like that

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,260
something like that but he made an

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,040
hour-long video his hour-long comeback

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,479
basically explaining everything to you

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,960
know the past the way past the present

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,619
and and the future and in that video I

27
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,170
won't spoil it too much free because I

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,369
think the guy should go check it out on

29
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,470
your own his channel settles channel be

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,630
back down in the description but you

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,360
know it's pretty exciting from to me

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,680
because you know you know throughout

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,329
this whole time you know that he quit

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,770
and he went sit in the video he kind of

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,780
just disappeared he wasn't on you know

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,810
social media that you guys saw you know

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,939
he was he I think he stayed before he

38
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,060
was you know on runescape he was you

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,829
know did feature in some of his buddies

40
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,250
channels but you know he wasn't it

41
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,009
wasn't you know a parent you know for

42
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,740
you guys to to see so he apologized for

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,899
that and but I was totally totally

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,530
understandable from you know my my point

45
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,380
of view I think you know it's you know

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,270
sometimes you know people just have you

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,750
know emotional you know issues I do you

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,940
one day will it's just it's it's

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,920
sometimes life can be hard

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,050
and sometimes people take it harder than

51
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,220
others and you know YouTube is honestly

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,720
a stressful job you know he said it

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
before I've said it before in past

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,190
videos and you know he just you know

55
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,870
took his little break and you know was

56
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,430
trying to figure him out the future of

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,620
his own channel the future of what he

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,170
wants to do and you know probably just

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,620
just just about everything and in my

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,290
opinion it was definitely you know

61
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,739
appropriate he did what he had to do and

62
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,630
now he's coming back and in my opinion

63
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,220
he's gonna be stronger than ever on

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,580
YouTube but you know I talked to I've

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,620
talked to him these past few years

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,360
not a boatload because you know I've

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,180
been very busy myself but I've always

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,550
you know tried my best to you know keep

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,730
on talking to him which you know I I

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,010
still am trying my best to talk to all

71
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,530
my internet friends out just lately I've

72
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,360
been very busy with life but that darn

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,130
slime but um he he's back I think you

74
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,620
guys should check out his video you know

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,360
he made many many you know replies to

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,590
people's statements to people etc and it

77
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,959
was honestly kind of a brave thing for

78
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
him to do but you know he did it

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,519
you know actually pretty darn good and I

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,070
hope that you know this there will be a

81
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,470
future of you know me and him making

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,269
videos together I think that would be

83
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,610
very awesome I think you guys would

84
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,019
