1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,840
sup guys dancing

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,100
the man they can't

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,189
when's yours

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,490
we're on a mission from God

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,369
this terrible short I sleep in this terrible short seven days a week is when

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,460
Francine wakes up and she sees this she smiles

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,590
good morning and see just because I don't put our roads and every episode

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,670
doesn't mean I don't run every day because I do and I'm going for a run

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:46,440
right now anything that i love as much as a summer run in New York City

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,920
fine

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,899
the days when you exercise it's easy to eat healthy on days when you don't

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,390
exercise you see garbage all day

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,080
I don't get that run its cheeseburgers and no shapes

14
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,049
I was looking at old footage yesterday and I saw some video footage of this

15
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,049
studio from last summer

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,869
here's the thing about this studio this place I I built this place from the

17
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:24,520
ground up this studio

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,539
this is like my sanctuary this is where I work this is where I make things this

19
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:33,310
is my happy place is just mean here this is my tree fort this place is like a

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:43,149
physical manifestation of who i am and i was looking at

21
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,610
whoa and as i was looking at that old footage in that video it was immaculate

22
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,729
here this place was perfect all the time and now and now it's like this

23
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:57,729
claustrophobic dumping here

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:08,920
I've got no one to blame for the current state of affairs but myself

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,310
I guess I've just been prioritizing making videos over taking care of the

26
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,520
studio and those two things really are mutually exclusive I should not be

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,930
decoupling them

28
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,950
i also just keep telling myself as soon as the new space is ready as soon as you

29
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,600
said the new space is ready

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,810
it is magnificent over here

31
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,320
the white lights are up right now that's why it's so clean and white here but

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,150
look how nice this is

33
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:44,110
I heard of fluoride and it's just wore to the in all is out of floors are

34
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,930
mopped this place is ready for work

35
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,800
there have been a lot of haters questioning the integrity of this loft

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,700
this is sound especially when considering this is only a storage

37
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,620
locker nobody working here

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,730
if anything this lock was wildly over built theirs

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,800
that this is gonna fall down any one beneath it like it would take something

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,070
bigger than an earthquake in order for this to happen to me that's a basics

41
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,680
big night tonight tonight date night we don't get date night often because it's

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,610
