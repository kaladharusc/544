1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
ready to go

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,990
taxi to work today I hate taking taxi

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,650
we're gonna pack up all my camera gear is coming with me today my trip and I

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,670
can't take it

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,240
I don't need to make excuses

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,240
your path

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,329
I don't really get sad for whatever reason I'm in like this perpetual state

8
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,040
of manic happiness

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,129
sad is not an emotion I know nostalgia a sentimental longing for the past

10
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,769
especially for time with a happy Association nostalgic being nostalgic

11
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:54,659
that is Who I am

12
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,559
maybe two guys I'm a hopeless romantic I have no idea but when left to my own

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,479
devices and no one bothers me

14
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,920
I go like this and just our thing of the past in ways that are just crushing

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,340
their debilitated and nothing nothing makes me more nostalgic then seeing old

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,399
pictures or old videos are thinking of the times when Owen my son was little

17
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:20,940
now you don't know and he's barely barely barely in this show

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,300
he's a teenager now he is a car he's about to finish high school

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,460
he's got a job he was just like he's just busy and he's rarely he's we don't

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,460
spend time together like when he was a little kid

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,200
yeah

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,369
surprising him and pick him up at school was was always my favorite thing

23
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,490
no one in my entire life has transcended the kind of journey in the way that I

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,090
have with Owen when when he was born like we did have a place to stay

25
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,310
we live in a friend's basement it is it always has been always will be my life's

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,240
mission to do right by him to make sure he has a good life

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,680
so as he grew up as he got older no matter what every year on his birthday

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,090
he and i would take a trip no matter how broke i was i really put aside money i

29
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,920
see that the entire year if I had to

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,280
he and I would always have a trip so it'd be just the two of us have some

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:33,250
special time together tomorrow

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,840
oh and turns 18 you have any idea how weird it is for me to have an 18 year

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,549
old adult child

34
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:42,910
I'm like 35 I was 16 we are pregnant with this kid

35
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,489
it is so weird he turns 18 he is turning into an adult tomorrow

36
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,489
so the two of us were going away

37
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:03,099
yeah

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,780
oh it's at home

39
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,709
I'm racing there to meet him now I took a little bit too much time at the office

40
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:24,069
but I'd so much to finish today before he and I could that I'm packing now

41
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,239
there's not enough space in my suitcase for clothes because i'm filling up with

42
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,239
camera equipment

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:53,220

86
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,000
this is an airbus a380 that's the gigantic two-story airplane

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,720
I've never been on one before i do you're going to 1 i've not been on one

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120

96
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,120
I don't think the flight attendants like my camera it's definitely about to come

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,120

98

really great i will send me the stink eye flight attendants about my cameras

104
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:04,759
what I understand considering the security situation Western Europe right

105
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,759
now it's not be a little sensitive about that

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
all right

107
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,979
