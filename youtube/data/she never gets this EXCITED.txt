hello cake there

29
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,290
we came all the way down here to go to the famous cafÃ© du monde

30
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,900
it's the city block clown

31
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,670

32
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,770
lovely I've got a baby and can't leave

33
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,770
and it works just like the whole life

34
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,379
yeah a beignet is basically a fried piece of dough covered in sugar

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,920

Candice and Francine and granny are all out

39
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,400
antique shopping with mike is my favorite thing to do so i'm taking the

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,550
skateboard and I'm gonna explore a little bit of New Orleans

41
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:43,090
everyone in this part of town seems to be completely drunk all the time so I'm

42
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,090
gonna try to find a different part of town

43
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,550
I'm completely lost I'm in the middle of a parking lot by the convention center

44
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,150
probably should look at a map before i left the hotel

45
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,259
now i am definitely in the middle of nowhere

46
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:14,979
this street is like majorly flooded but there's this amazing factory behind all

47
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,000
fences and then water to get over there that want a closer look at this thing

48
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,509
don't have to go remote

49
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,439
thank you so much harder

50
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,639

51
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,389
when you look at the I mean I'll get it but I'm really annoyed because you're

52
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,419
the one that left it at home and you're the one that needs it and it's like

53
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,990
always to do is get it down there and you just made my life so difficult the

54
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,740
time

55
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,919

56
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,879

57
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,689

81
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
ever been so fun

82
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,760
