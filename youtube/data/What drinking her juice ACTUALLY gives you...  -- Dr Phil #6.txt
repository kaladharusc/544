1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,620
So, you ask people...

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,620
This is 2 Â½ cups

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,500
And... you want people to build up to drinking a gallon of this a day?&quot;

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,820
-Right, cause the thing is people

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,740
People are very malnourished.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,960
What's going on is you're so immuno-compromised

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,740
you are not absorbing all the nutrition,

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,740
that's why you see mutation from people

-Hello, everybody

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,300
I'm back again with another Dr. Phil video

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,020
What children are you going to make fun of this week, Felix?

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,480
Mhm Mhm, No No No

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,060
I would never sink so low to do that,

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,820
Okay?

16
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,600
Today we're going to make fun of a grown adult woman, everybody.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,440
Her name is Jilly,

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,280
The creator of Jilly Juice

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,340
Actually I don't know her name is Jilly,  maybe- I don't know.

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,340
She has created this juice.

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,520
That you're supposed to drink a gallon a day

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,020
How much is a gallon?

23
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
Gallon in liters

24
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,020
Three point-
[Felix laughs]

25
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,620
Jesus Christ!

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,440
Just drink a gallon, just drink a gallon of this...

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,720
Sewer water.

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,800
I won't explain too much, let's just go through it. Cause this is hilarious

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,820
-When you act-
[crowd laughs]

30
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,040
When you've actually flood your system,

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
you're actually feeding your body what
it wasn't ordinarily getting because

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,810
you're being undermined by parasites
you're being undermined by all the different toxins

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,000
that are going t- attacking you
at the cellular level'

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,500
She's a classic example of someone that hasn't studied anything, just read up online

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,100
and then think they're an expert on a subject.

36
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,200
I realize I do this all the time, damn it.

37
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,400
&quot;It's actually the molecular cellular
levels of the toxins in your body

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,500
which solves all your problems&quot;

39
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,800
- Jilly Juice, two cups a day, work up to a gallon...
- Yes

00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,700
- Diet which is ser-
- Work up to a gallon a day...

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,000
- You acknowledge that they're gonna feel really not great

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,960
when they start drinking this
- You're gonna have a ton of what she calls &quot;waterfalls&quot; AKA

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,080
Explosive Diarrhea.
[Felix cracks up]

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,600
- They're gonna feel healing
- They're gonna feel healing...

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
- Have pictures of people that have regrown arms and stuff?

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
- Absolutely not because I haven't gotten that,

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,480
I've only been doing this for a year
- So you don't have any proof that this regrows arms?

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,661
- Proof is all relative,
I've seen proof in smaller experiences

49
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,620
- So she's claiming

50
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,600
that this juice can do a lot of things,
we'll get into all of it,

51
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,000
but one of them is the outrageous claim that it can regrow arms.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,500
So, if you lost your arm, drinking this juice...

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,300
Got a new one, hooray!

54
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
- You don't have any proof that this regrows arms...

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
- Proof is all relative! I've
seen proof

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,300
- But &quot;proof is all relative&quot;...
Ok, could this juice make me live forever?

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,800
&quot;Proof is relative. I haven't gotten that
far yet but, I mean, I'm not dead yet, am I, Dr. Phil? Hmmm&quot;

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,080
&quot;Proof is all relative!&quot;
I've only done this for a year, ok?

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,500
How is that strengthening your claim?
This woman, my God...

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,000
- Proof is not relative, you have it or you don't
- It is!

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,489
- Do you have any training? (x2)

62
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,500
- I have enough training by looking at the internet and actually taking information

63
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,400
- Yes, &quot;I have enough training by reading mumbo-jumbo online. That's all I need, Dr. Phil,

64
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I don't need a PhD to show that I'm
a genius&quot;

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,500
- No medical education or degree
- No

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
- You have no medical license
- No

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,100
- You have no scientific studies
- Nope

68
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,000
- You have no clinical studies
- Nope

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,300
- Even human studies, animal studies...
- No!

70
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,200
- &quot;Do you have a brain? &quot;No&quot;
Ok, great.

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,600
- Do you want to see what they left behind?

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,300
Do you see your friends and family dying of cancer disease and chronic illness?

73
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Is that what you want? 
- Your claims are that you can regrow

74
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,500
- Oh, here it is. [CLAP] Here it is. Oh my God...
[Felix laughs]

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,640
You can regrow organs, by the way.
The drink doesn't even have anything that

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,290
contains what you need to regrow any of this but it just does it, okay?

77
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,100
It is miracle juice. It's not just a miracle juice, it's Jilly Juice.

78
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,600
- Regrow organs and limbs...
- Right! If you can heal a cut on your on your arm,

79
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,799
that's your integumentary system, right? These are cells that are that are regrowing so

80
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,329
how can that not be a leap to regrow your organs?
- So if I lose...

81
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:10,300
- So, when I cut myself, it heals so therefore my juice can regrow organs!

82
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,300
My God...

83
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,400
- ...my arm in an accident I can...
- You can potentially, yes

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,800
- So do I pour this on or I drink it?
- You drink it, you heal from the inside out

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,500
- So I drink this and that arm is just going to regrow.

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,300
- Well, you see... [CROWD LAUGHS]
- Is that it?

87
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,200
- ...I get it, it happens over time.
- I'm asking because I want to know what it is just to know.

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,800
What you're saying is that it'll regrow.
- Because, look, you heal your cut on your arm, right?

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,200
You see, yes, you can regrow it potentially
- You say we can live to 400 years old

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,200
- YES!
- &quot;You can live 400 years. I've done this for a year, okay?

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,900
I'm don- I read it on the Internet. I've done the science, Dr. Phil!

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,600
Who do you think you are!? Some kind of doctor!?&quot;

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,400
- ...and cancer, you just reverse it, any kind of cancer.
- Of course! Cancer is a fungus!

94
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,120
- &quot;Cancer is a fungus&quot;... Isthatwhatshesaid? This stuff really pisses me off

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,400
because you get to the point... I've
heard stories about similar things

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,200
where people will jump off their cancer treatment to do some sort of

97
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,300
juice cleansing heal-all. All you have to do is eat right,

98
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,300
you don't need all this medication and then people actually die from these sort of things

99
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,300
because they get fed up with the doctors' result not giving them what they want

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,600
so they take a blind leap of faith by someone that literally is just preying

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,400
on people in pain, people that are suffering...

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,500
- If you drink this... Down syndrome, all the cells just completely reformat...

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,800
- Absolutely! Like growing pains...
- Essential features, it rechecks, your features change...

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,490
- Absolutely, 'cause you're morphing, like when you are growing, your bones shift.

105
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,800
It's painful!
- And you say that this will reverse homosexuality...

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:01,500
- Yes, because...
[DOUBLE FACEPALM and LAUGH]

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,300

I mean, it is funny...

108
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Just the way she says it as well... &quot;So you're saying this will reverse homosexuality?&quot;

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,500
&quot;Yeah, you betcha! No more gayness!&quot;

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,100
How do you end up like this?

111
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,800
- If you have nothing of those and
you happen to be homosexual,

112
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,500
then you might as well just do this and see what it does to you.

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,100
- That is just outrageous...
- It is!

114
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
- It is outrageous...
- Of course it is!!!

That smile too... She's really bothering me.

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,800
&quot;How can you know if you don't try it?
How can you criticize it if you never drank the juice?&quot;

147
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,600
- Now Jeff holiday, a debunker of
pseudoscience on YouTube

148
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
- Could've been me! That could've been me in the studio.

149
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,400
- if you follow Jillian's protocol and you drink about a gallon of this crap a day,

150
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,200
you're gonna end up drinking 4 times the recommended healthy amount of salt.

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,410
Not only does this not do what she thinks it's supposed to do but it is actually harmful

152
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,310
thinks it's supposed to do but it is
actually harmful because it's convincing

153
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,400
people to give themselves sodium
poisoning. That can lead to

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,000
confusion, dizziness, seizures, coma, strokes and even death.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,700
So this juice has so much salt in it, it's like drinking out of the ocean

156
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,500
and it actually had serious causes on other people, negative effects.

157
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,700
- He raises a very good point. You have all of these claims but you have no data,

158
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,530
you have no basis for this. You have some people...
- Myself!

159
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:36,500
I looked into her data, by the way, and [LAUGHS]
I love that this is from her website:

160
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,500
&quot;Here's the change I've experienced on the protocol&quot;, Jillian. This is me before:

161
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,300
This is me after:
What does it mean!?

162
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,800
Oh, ok. That's before and that's after...
Sorry, I didn't see it properly.

163
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,700
You lost a little bit of weight like what [LAUGHS]
What's the difference!?

164
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,500
So she's the only testimony to this Jilly Juice you go to

165
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
You go to her... her PDF. Wha- what is the normal...

166
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,580
what is normal, the science behind the protocol, so she wrote this scientific thing and

167
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,390
it starts off with just a bunch of
quotes, which is always a great way,

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,900
if you have a cult to convince people, to bring in quotes from people that had nothing really to do

169
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,700
with your study, like Arthur Schopenhauer, to somehow legitimize your claims.

170
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,500
- You've not regrown any limbs, you haven't
- But I'm not missing!

171
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,200
- &quot;You haven't regrown any limbs&quot;
&quot;I'm not missing any limbs. Am I, Dr. Phil? Huh?

172
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,700
How do you think that happened, huh? 
Why do you think I'm not missing any limbs, huh?&quot;

173
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,400
So Jeff asked her &quot;do you feel responsible for the people you've hurt with this treatment

174
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,000
- Here is the thing, here is the thing,  I'm actually teaching people

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
how to learn about their own body themselves to make their own decision.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,200
- Do you feel responsible for the people who follow your protocol and they get hurt?

177
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,300
Do you feel responsible?
- No, I don't feel responsible, know why?

178
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,800
Because they had the opportunity to read my information, to understand, I have it all free.

179
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,600
- &quot;So they had the opportunity to read my information and it's their fault for reading

180
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,500
my information that I'm telling it's supposed to help them, it's their fault&quot;

181
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
- Damnit... So, ok, we heard about the juice.

182
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,600
Yeah (x3), the juice is so bad, but
let's hear about the people that drank the juice,

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,300
that got to experience the holy healing power of the juice.

184
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,200
- I had chronic illnesses and I was in and out of the hospitals and constantly

185
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,950
being submitted in the ER. Since the Jilly Juice I have not had to take any

186
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,600
of the medication, that changed my life.
- I am very happy with the protocol, it's my life.

187
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,300
When I discovered that I have psoriasis, I decided to go to many different dermatologists,

188
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,000
I spent about $800/month on-
- She's not even drinking juice, she's-

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,500
it's street water [LAUGHS] Guess what? Drinking water clears your skin out, everybody.

190
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,800
I don't want to be that guy but you can clearly see she has a breakout still in her skin,

191
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,500
she's just using foundatio nto cover it up like...
What's the difference?

192
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,300
You put on more make-up?
- Not only am I benefiting from Jilly Juice

193
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,700
but the rest of my family is also.
My son has autism and my daughter has ADHD.

194
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Since being on Jilly Juice, my son has been tested and he is in moderate autism,

195
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,000
prior to that his symptoms were showing severe autism.

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,300
- Don't give this to your kids, my God...
- My daughter, her grades have gone up.

197
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,200
- Her grades went up! The Jilly Juice will not just cure your son's autism,

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,900
it will also help improve their grades, everybody.
I don't know how you cannot be sold

199
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,300
on the daily juice yet.
- Jilly Juice has done an amazing thing for me:

200
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,700
I feel happier, I feel younger, I fee-
- Yeah, you went through a midlife crisis

201
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,800
and you got over it, congratulations.
- I'm the healthiest I've ever been thanks to th-

202
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,810
- Doubt. Where's the doubt? Me, I seriously doubt that. I doubt it.

203
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,000
She's just been paid, she's been paid off, they're being paid off.

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,500
So how long, Rasheed, have you been doing this?
- I started the protocol on June 30th of 2017.

205
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,400
- And did your body have a big reaction to it
when you started?      - Oh, definitely.

206
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,500
- Did you have these &quot;waterfalls&quot;?
- Oh, definitely.

207
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,000
- So this brings us to... [LAUGHS]

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,700
the pain part of the treatment, which is what they call &quot;the waterfall&quot;.

209
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,500
- Do you have these &quot;waterfalls&quot;?
- Oh, definitely.

210
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,900
- It gives you diarrhea.
(JILLY) It's not diarrhea!    (JEFF) Violent diarrhea.

211
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,000
- It's called &quot;waterfalls&quot; because it's different context, different intention and different outcomes.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,500
- It's not diarrhea, it's &quot;waterfalls&quot;.
&quot;WATERFALLS&quot;!

213
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,000
- It's called &quot;waterfalls&quot; because it's different context, different intention and different outcomes.

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
- Ok, explosive diarrhea...
[CROWD &amp; FELIX LAUGH AGREEING]

215
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,300
- But it's not diarrhea.
[CROWD CHEERS]

216
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,500
- YAAAS!

217
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,300
- How exactly is violently peeing out your butt supposed to help your immune system?

218
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,700
- Because your immune system is working because of that.

219
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,500
- I have a question, have you tried it?
 - Haha, NOOO. [CROWD AGREES LAUGHING] NOOO.

220
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,800
- That's the answer, you're no-
- Yeah, you can look like this:

221
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,300
&quot;Huh, you haven't tried it. Why are you hating on it? Look at me.

222
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,000
Look at me, alright, perfectly healthy.
You haven't tried it, how dare you criticize me?

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,100
- Let me ask you something, do you believe that if you if you had an arm cut off you could drink this

224
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,500
and it would just grow back?
- I do but we haven't seen that
happen.

225
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,400
- &quot;I do but we haven't seen it happen&quot;. So you haven't proved it!

226
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,000
- We're different, we're different.
(PHIL) - No, we're not different.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
- We are!
- No, we're not different.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
[INCOMPREHENSIBLE]
- We're not different: I'm right and you're wrong.

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
[CROWD &amp; FELIX REACT LIKE THE TURNDOWNFORWHAT MEME]

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,800
As you can see here from reviews, people love Jilly Juice, it's the best,

231
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,300
everyone trusts Jilly Juice.
The only positive review is from Anne,

232
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,880
who says &quot;she feels alive&quot;.
- The juice caused her to suffer 2 strokes

233
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,750
but when she complain-
- So here's the bit that's just really annoying

234
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,680
because you see these people, these poor people, who tried the jelly juice and suffered

235
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,600
actual health issues, severe health issues, because of it, because it's so much salt,

236
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,000
which can cause strokes.
- Experience with Jilly Juice was horrible,

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,300
it tasted like swamp water.
- I've always called it &quot;sewer water&quot;.

238
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,510
The more I took of it, the longer I would be in the bathroom.

239
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,200
- I had nothing but trouble: my kidneys
hurt, my pancreas hurt, I had a headache

240
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,700
that I could not get rid of.
- Pain cramps... I felt like there was a spike in my head.

241
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,200
- My blood pressure was so high my face was drooping, I was slurring my words,

242
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,800
I wasn't going to have a stroke for Jillian.
- My hand was numb, it was tingling,

243
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,600
the fingers, I couldn't pry them apart, they were stuck together. I talked to the doctor and he says

244
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,200
&quot;I think we need an MRI&quot;. They were able to definitively see the fact that there were 2 strokes.

245
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,700
- Jesus Christ...
- Her reaction was &quot;well you don't have to worry

246
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,800
about that but I've got plenty of lawyers&quot; and she says &quot;you were supposed to keep drinking the juice,

247
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,300
that was just a symptom, you didn't die&quot;.

248
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,600
I said &quot;no, I didn't die, am I supposed to die to prove your theory?&quot;

249
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,830
- I mean... yeah, obviously.
She doesn't have to prove anything.

250
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,760
Alright let's hear from a doctor,
what a real doctor has to say about Jilly Juice.

251
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,800
- Doctor, indeed thank you for being here. This is the stuff, would you like to take a drink?

252
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,300
[JILLIAN LAUGHS] - Thank you, I'll pass.
- No thanks? Ok.

253
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,000
- Wha- What do you think about these claims?
- That amount of sodium in 1 cup,

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
as you mentioned earlier, is 2 to 3 times what the daily allotment is for a normal individual.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,600
If an individual has risk factors like hypertension or kidney disease,

256
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,200
then it's even 4 to 5 times the recommended amount.
The 2nd point is that these &quot;waterfalls&quot; or diarrhea,

257
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,700
the point that you don't lose electrolytes in diarrhea is completely false.

258
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,000
- It'snotdiarrhea.
[FELIX LOSES IT SILENTLY]

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,800
- &quot;It's not diarrhea, get it right, it's not diarrhea. It's not what diarrhea, it's &quot;waterfalls&quot;&quot;.

260
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,500
- It'snotdiarrhea.
- &quot;It's not diarrhea, you idiot.

261
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,800
- It'snotdiarrhea.
- &quot;Get it right&quot;. The way she says that, she's so pissed.

262
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,600
&quot;It's not diarrhea! I've been telling you guys so long!
It's not diarrhea but you don't unders-&quot;

263
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,400
- I think t's clear that, unfortunately, our our level and body of information has limitations

264
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,200
We don't have all the answers
- No no, SHE doesn't have all the answers.

265
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,900
Jilly from Jilly Juice has all the answers, everybody.

266
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:32,000
I think what we need to do here is dismember Jilly Juice. I'm not saying we should, ok, by any means,

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,700
but it would be interesting to see, would everything grow back? Now, I'm not a medical expert, okay,

268
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,700
but it seems to me that everyone just wants a free pass to everything. Everyone wants the next miracle thing.

269
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,600
This is what's gonna get you to lose weight or this one is gonna get you to lose weight.

270
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,100
Oh, no no, you got it all wrong, this is the magic stuff that is gonna do it for you.

271
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,600
Exercise and eat healthier has never failed anyone. Stop taking shortcuts and stop listening

272
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,500
to insane people, including me

273
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,640
Thank you everyone for watching this video. Leave a like if you enjoyed, would really very much appreciate it.

Thank you, subscribe if you are not
subscribed yet, I upload videos every day, son.

275
