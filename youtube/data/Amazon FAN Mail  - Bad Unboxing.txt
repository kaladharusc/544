actual speakers on the device itself the

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,290
volume is purely for plugging in

47
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,060
headphones and listening to it all right

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,770

right is that these are 58 millimeter

57
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,400

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,850
lens

59
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,060
