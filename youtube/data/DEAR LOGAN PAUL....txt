2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,059
whole righteous SJW facade it just seems

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,490
a bit forced it doesn't seem that

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,770
genuine at all thank you said Logan

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,810
you're a dog can they be back to dog off

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,240
into a corner eventually it's gonna by

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,439
and that's what you're doing right now

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,349
Logan so this video will be me putting

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,390
the muzzle on your mouth and shutting

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,460
down every single point that you've made

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,920
and then after that destroying you some

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,440
more so let's begin I just don't think

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,480
the moderator of the press conference

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,250
the person who should be neutral the

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,230
person who should be the one driving the

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,930
conversation should be a Logan and Jake

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,530
ball hater skinned its bro whose

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,079
decision was that it was yours your team

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,690
and my team agreed that true Jordy was

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,969
okay to be the host also the host at the

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,890
LA press conference Shannon Briggs

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,420
wasn't new to at all

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,180
as well as Shannon Briggs came to the UK

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,519
press conference as part of your team

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,549
how is that neutral also true Jordy made

26
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,770
a video straight after the UK press

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,080
conference explaining how he went into

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,600
it trying to be neutral so I would go

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,369
what's that video to be educated about

30
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,680
that situation yes I I did not want to

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,689
take the low blows I did not want to get

32
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,580
personal but you bring it on my

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,939
girlfriend you got a new girlfriend now

34
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,220
Chloe Bennet

35
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,100
what's up babes

36
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,100
[Music]

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,530
okay let's address this clearly I didn't

38
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,390
tell the audience to change you can

39
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,610
clearly see me signaling that it's not

40
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,530
me doing this so you can't hold me

41
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,270
accountable for this because the

42
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,580
audience did it on their own accord now

43
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,500
I'm not saying what they said is right

44
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,230
by any means but if you felt so strongly

45
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,540
about it why didn't you say or do

46
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,640
anything there and then you sat there

47
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,770
and did nothing you had a mic everyone

48
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,720
could hear you and you still did nothing

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,820
if you truly care then you either said

50
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,830
something after I sense this becoming an

51
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,410
issue after you said this about Chloe in

52
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,179
your last video how's he gonna go down

53
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,900
on you a busted lip I'm sorry Chloe but

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,330
after the turn a clip of August loads

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,190
gonna have to see like your prostitute

56
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,990
if you know what I mean

57
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:26,460
before the London press conference in my

58
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,680
if you literally play the clip a second

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,060
longer you understand why I said a

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,450
busted lip I'm sorry fuck you like your

61
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,100
prostitute if you know what I mean no no

62
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,700
no kissing today okay so just to clarify

63
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,270
I am not calling Chloe a prostitute I'm

64
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,760
just comparing to the fact that usually

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,550
you can't kiss prostitutes and after I

66
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,950
bust up your lip Logan you won't be able

67
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,040
to kiss her either ah manipulation on

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,110
its finest I'm not gonna sit there and

69
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,090
talk about your disgusting sexual

70
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,890
harassment issues in the past I will

71
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,200
address this in several videos and I'll

72
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,880
put them in the description even though

73
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
I know you're not gonna watch them

74
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,730
anyway sorry I don't need to address it

75
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:27,280
here again I think that us girls need to

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,550
kind of stand up for ourselves

77
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,320
okay first of all this video Theodora

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,150
has nothing to do with me

79
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,880
you're literally lying and manipulating

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,220
your audience when I made that video of

81
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,440
Casper he and I knew that the comment I

82
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,810
was making were joke I spoke with her

83
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,910
and apologized and it was all sorted

84
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,220
back then so I find it interesting why

85
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,290
you're bringing out things from so long

86
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,960
ago when they were already sorted back

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,850
then no that's gonna have to you like

88
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,530
your prostitute if you know what I mean

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,790
huh

90
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,480
let me show so real bad again why don't

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,760
you just play the full clip Logan I know

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,560
what you're trying to do and it's a

93
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,810
shame because you're young personable

94
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,150
fans are going to fall for it you know

95
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,010
women have a choice right you know

96
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,210
sometimes they don't like those comments

97
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,770
and I feel like you should have learned

98
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,810
that from what happened six years ago my

99
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,260
girl is not an object she is a real-life

100
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,110
human being not a girl who gets passed

101
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,610
around to the dude with more ball

102
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,870
percentage Logan you are blowing this

103
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,800
way out of proportion

104
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,960
I didn't make any derogatory comments

105
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,540
towards Chloe I was simply making a joke

106
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,480
about your lack of testicle when it

107
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,640
comes to the objectification of women

108
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm not even sure I have room to talk as

109
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,470
I have been guilty of this in the past

110
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,570
specifically with my music video no

111
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,700
handlebars this is no handlebars I'm

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,220
going over and I am deleting it from

113
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,440
YouTube okay fair enough if you want to

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,570
delete that video but if that's the case

115
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,870
then you might want to probably delete

116
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,980
this video as well

117
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,920
[Music]

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,410
on this video this idea where I would

119
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,370
ride them but like but like a bicycle

120
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,510
not in the sexual way so we're gonna

121
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,160
make this thing as formation out of

122
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,780
people it's called the human but we're

123
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,640
gonna put the girls and me on this

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,100
platform and then roll down this issue

125
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,580
is it looks kind of ridiculous like this

126
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,320
so yeah except it's gonna be four girls

127
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,190
than me on the issue is that we haven't

128
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,810
told them we're doing this yet so that

129
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,600
should be on this video other side of

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,450
the head of course yes all right

131
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,790

what no I don't know camera zoom oh just

134
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,960
do everyone a favor and delete your

135
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,220
whole channel I actually did a

136
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,600
face-to-face with ksi

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
but this kid literally looked me in the

138
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,840
eye and told me he was God g.od God

139
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,310
that's where his head is that right now

140
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,980
I wouldn't get in the ring I'm I'm an

me on the gold you're you're a god this

143
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,280
is what God looks like Jesus Christ we

144
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,020
got some work to do why talk about my

145
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,270
soul this ladies and gentlemen is an

146
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,730
example of Americans now understanding

147
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,370
sarcasm Logan honestly I don't believe

148
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,710
that I am a god I'm not omniscient

149
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,460
I'm not omnipotent and I'm definitely

150
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,500
normally benevolent Wow

151
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,480
I do recognize this type of behavior

before a JJ you are me moments before I

153
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,750
flew to Japan oh my god Logan you're so

154
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,730
right making a comment about your

155
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,190
testicles and what you did in January or

156
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,660
exactly the same thing by the way that

157
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,750
was sarcasm

playing chess Logan let me tell you how

161
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,140
it is okay in that UK press conference

162
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,730
you couldn't think of a good comeback on

163
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,900
that stage you couldn't handle the

164
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,410
pressure that's why you left that's why

165
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,480
you made this video and now it's your PR
