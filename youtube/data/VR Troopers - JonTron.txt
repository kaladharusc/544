00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,860
mind of dying and then you just kill

so that new Power Rangers movie came out

36
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,819
recently which got me thinking about

37
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,250
Power Rangers it's got me thinking about

38
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,150
Saban's

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,390
other more underrated classic and no I'm

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,190
not talking about the one with Joker Jay

41
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,290
Leno I tried I just tried to pretend

42
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,940
that one doesn't exist what I'm talking

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,280
about is vr troopers also known as this

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,110
is not Power Rangers definitely 100%

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,000
this is its own show for real this show

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,040
came out during the resurgence of VR in

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,810
the 90s and even though it died out then

48
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,209
as many trending waves of VR did it's

49
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,890
pretty crazy to think we finally have

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,870
the VR we always dreamed of having back

51
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,000
then so in honor of all this amazing new

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,950
technology we're actually getting let's

53
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,349
take a dive in the VR sordid past and

54
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,910
relive our view of the future that was

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,069
never to be by the way I don't think vr

56
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,750
troopers is compatible with my modern

57
00:02:48,750 --> 00:03:03,570
headset that'll dig up some old hardware

buying the desk so our story follows

76
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,540
kung-fu teenagers Ryan Caitlyn and JB

mr. Miyagi and a feral dog totally

unrelated to that our heroes are also

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,660
environmental activists aided by a

81
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,370

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,530
making eye contact with him as you make

91
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,030

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,469
reach professor Hart this story I'm not

169
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,449
saying it's bad you just saying all of a

170
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:07,949
sudden you know got a little more

171
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,630
complicated got a couple more characters

172
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,620
to follow here now

173
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,539
so apparently Ryan and Friends have been

174
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,580
targeted by the evil Grimm lore he then

175
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,240
sends his virtual henchman to the real

176
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,979
world or are they in the virtual world

177
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,330
that who cares

178
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,710
Saban sure doesn't what was that I think

179
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,270

180
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,350

181

182
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,979

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,030

184
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,070

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:57,690

00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,350
[Music]

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,150
familiar faces

188
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,400
so one commercial break later and our

189
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,170
heroes somehow escape the two attack

190
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,210
drones off screen when they stumble upon

191
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,070
a rejected art house project in the

192
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,310
middle of nowhere what is this looks

193
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,010
like some kind of portal or a gateway oh

194

228
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
and that by using the spirit stones from

229
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,670
ocarina of time

230
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,500
these young teenagers can transform into

231
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,930

232

they are

234
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,149
meanwhile Ryan tries to connect with his

235
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,980
pops but things get a little awkward any

236
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,720

237

all right all of a sudden he just that

249
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,519
just it just came to him he remembered

250
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,360
his instincts

251

when we were kids we didn't we didn't

252

256
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,470
there he goes he's got a busted shoulder

257
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,209

258
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,040
a cliff for that shot so Ryan gets

259
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,930
knocked out so hard the episode ends

260
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,300
meanwhile in part two Caitlin and JV

261
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,160
returned home only to realize they left

262
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,699
Ryan for dead in the middle of nowhere

263
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,769
whoops

264
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,730
I just can't do it dad my god poor guy

266
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:45,499
baby I tried my best but I'm not

267

you gotta fear your son use the regular

269
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,170
run-of-the-mill failure don't be so easy

270
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,949
on yourself JB is there any sign of Ryan

271
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,839
yet it doesn't make sense

272
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,209
these were his last coordinates wait a

273
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:08,149
minute I see him fuck his dog I wish

274
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,889
there was way we could get to him faster

275
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,009
he's gonna be okay right I hope so

276
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,529
there's something wrong I can't control

277
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,700

280
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
liberty of making a few adjustments on

281
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,810

286
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,519
preemptively hit their head in a rock

287
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,040

full-scale offensive very soon this is

297

332
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,690
like he's got a more plausible job than

333
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,260
you woody

334
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,880
after catching woody in an act of

335
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,130
workplace incompetence Caitlin takes the

336
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,810
day off to get the next big scoop on

337
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,430
grim Lords advancing army of toy

338
00:15:47,430 --> 00:16:06,480
miniatures I said this will let us

339
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,080
communicate with him from any computer

340
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,940
yes troopers is there a problem oh shit

341
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,230
I remember when Horatio Hart used to

342
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,490
come on floppy disk

343
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,590
those were the days although this looks

344
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,390
a bit different than I remember which

345
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:26,010
one that I have I saw me Jose Jose Kong

346
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,220
Sally like I said are you a robot stop

347
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,300
damn he bade Chinese knockoff

348
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,800
after finding irrefutable evidence that

349
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,900
grim Lord is a big meanie who smells our

350
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,760
hero's suit up and set out to beat him

351
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,420
for good

352
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,210

354
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,990

355
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,090

356

357
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,630

360
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,870
this is like another show I don't think

361
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,400
I've ever seen a show like this this is

362
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,560
completely unique show I can handle this

363
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,220
it's like a video game

364
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,320
whoa killed those dudes just like a

365
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,290
video game this explosive otter blowing

366
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,450
leaves are - yeah this bomb ought to do

367
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,390
the trick of blowing everything up not

368
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,190
satisfied with the obliteration of grim

369
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,290
Lords aerial troops Ryan takes to the

370
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,940
ground to finish off the remaining weak

371
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:50,100
and wounded

372
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:58,050
take that sick tour

373
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,060
following the deaths of dozens to

374
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,800
hundreds Grimm Lord finally admits

375
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,570
defeat and the gang celebrates with an

376
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,000
awesome slow-mo high-five I called you

377
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,830

378
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,520
done so what now professor yeah I mean

379
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,020
oh we've done with this Grimm Lord God

380
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,180
for good well unfortunately there are at

381
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,370
least 90 more episodes of this show so

382
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,040
probably not enjoy your moment of

383
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,710
triumph ah okay you may have won the

384
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:29,370
battle damn dog always double taken

385
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,080
making goofs in front of the supreme

386
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,000
lord of the universe with the day saved

387
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,430
ryan returns to trespassing private

388
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,530
property so we can think about his rogue

389
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,050
parents once again and a long fight

390
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,390
it'll be but if there's one thing you

391
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,330
taught me it's to never give up no

392
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,870
matter how hard it gets I won't quit

393
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,010
until you and I are together again I

394
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,430
love you Ted you know after all this it

395
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,320
makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna see my

396
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,450
dad again he said he was gonna go out

397
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,190
and buy me a parakeet but he never came

398
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,530
back so either he was lying or he was

399
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,020
hit by something large and fast but it's

400
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,300
just like dad always told me never give

401
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,000
up unless it's looking for me but I'll

402
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,860
never give up the search for my old man

403
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,900
and I'll find you even if you are a

404
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,550
skeleton in a shallow grave on the

405
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,060
