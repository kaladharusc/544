1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,820
I cannot wait that's why I came to Vegas

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,890
I fly home tomorrow morning after I get

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,509
my plate I'm out of here

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,059
not even hitting the craps tables we

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,429
gotta hit the craps table one it was

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,490
like an hour an hour at the craps table

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:30,240
after swish our flights back its 6:52

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,510
a.m. on a Thursday in New York City at

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,399
John F Kennedy Airport and I'm currently

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:44,610
on their way to Las Vegas this is not

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,129
like a bachelor party trip or like a

12
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,070
party trip or a gambling trip this is

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,030
more about science so yes science I'll

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,620
explain when I get there I got a I got a

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,100
go to bed now ladies and gentlemen get

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,899
low intellect with me Las Vegas local

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,830
time is 5 10 22 and

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,479
[Music]

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,189
they have slot machines in the airport

20
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:47,310
here I'm in that hotel room now and I

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,670
and I am going to explain to you exactly

22
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,979
what I'm doing here in Las Vegas but

23
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,569
first I need to show you this hotel room

24
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,429
Justin the last thing I've talked to you

25
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,049
about yesterday was that I would be

26
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,670
happy to sleep on the couch if you

27
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,259
wanted to just get one small room for us

28
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,459
to share yeah

29
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,560
what is this absurdity Elaine wouldn't

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,269
haven't allow me to show you this hotel

31
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:13,730
remain a brief tour of the hotel room

32
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,680
this is the coffee maker breakfast table

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,049
living room number one living room

34
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,920
number two guess this is like a bar

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,870
place a kitchen but we made it our

36
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,130
office foosball room bathroom number one

37
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,609
stairwell hallway master bedroom

38
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,970
awesome bathroom number two bathroom

39
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,599
number three bathtub number one

40
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,599
bedroom number two this is a steam

41
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,099
shower number two I think that concludes

42
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:00,340
the tour of the justin hotel room

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,790
today's place justin Larry Tate is a

44
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,060
single-seat flying machine it's a 250

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,389
pound vehicle called flyer think pontoon

46
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,579
plane mixed with drone you fly it over

47
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,049
the water the company behind it called

48
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,060
Kitty Hawk is funded by the Google

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,250
co-founder run by self-driving car

50
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:27,169
pioneer Sebastian turn oh my god yep

51
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,450
so that's what we're doing here Larry

52
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,849
Page the co-founder of Google has this

53
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,000
side project that's like to build a fly

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,700
it's not a drone no it's like a tiny

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,980
flying car ultralight aircraft I think

56
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,090
that's how they got approval to actually

57
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,969
fly it okay but no one has flown it they

58
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,680
just announced that this thing exists

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,069
this morning they invited me out here

60
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,930
and because Justin built the human

61
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,729
flying drone I'm like this is the best

62
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,949
aeronautics expert I know he has to be

63
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:55,750
there

64
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,519
today we're going for training yeah

65
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,840
they're gonna show us how it works we're

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,609
not here right I don't think so I think

67
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,629
that's the first thing tomorrow morning

68
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,780
today we're gonna train and then

69
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,930
tomorrow morning at 3 a.m. we're gonna

70
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,500
fly it and that's we're doing here

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,560
science

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,400
[Music]

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,229
you sure you know how to handle this

74
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,240
thing me not know you can worst driver

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,990
on planet Earth

76
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:40,550
[Music]

77
00:04:40,550 --> 00:05:11,169
[Music]

78
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,060
within like a couple of hours you are

79
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,340
going to be 100% capable of flying this

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,229
vehicle this feels like a total like

81
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:19,430
mission impossible

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,740
area 51 approach and we're in this

83
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,020
Lagoon outside of Las Vegas

84
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,479
well done a little ways here little

85
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
oasis yeah just we need to reveal yeah

86
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:42,550
that's the big reveal okay ready

87
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,530
it's like a PlayStation controller can I

88
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,780
say that it's like a PlayStation

89
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,170
controller

90
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,360
[Music]

91
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,789
the goal is to make flying absolutely

92
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,199
easy something that you can learn to do

93
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,370
in a couple hours

94
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,100
[Music]

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,140
this is the simulator right I'm gonna

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,600
now go in the simulator and learn how to

97
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,360
virtually fly the flier is that that

98
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,660
factor okay I'm now getting in the

99
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:34,999
simulator right here all right I'm ready

100
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,419
fathers start to ramp down will start to

101
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,599
slow down

102
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,610
and then you can purchase it out so

103
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,460
those are the basic functions for flying

104
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,949
you and it

105
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,800
I was really paying attention yeah yes

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,069
it felt extremely intuitive this might

107
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,110
be a reach but it seems easier to fly

108
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,869
them like a Mavic drone there's less

109
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:05,759
axes I'm also trying their controller I

110
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,339
can yeah you don't yeah and like you

111
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,209
don't have to think about once you've

112
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,889
set your altitude you don't have to I

113
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,029
mean the consequences they're just

114
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,219
slightly higher than flying a 600 are

115
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:20,180
drones but it felt as intuitive

116
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,999
jacked this is the part where I sit in

117
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,330
that flyer right there we're not going

118
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,559
up at all right it's anchored but it's

119
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:41,680
gonna spin

120
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:56,240
[Music]

121
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,010
alright this is it this is the last bit

122
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,570
of emergency training what what exactly

123
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,270
is going on here this looks like Chuckie

124
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,930
Cheese

125
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,090
so this is the last part of emergency

126
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,170
procedures training this is our dry lake

127
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,930
it is full of colorful balls we're gonna

128
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,900
put you in and we're going to spit it

129
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,730
upside down and have you release the

130
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,810
seatbelt and get out done all right

131
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,430
again just wait so we're done flipping

132
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,090
then release and swim out of the

133
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,860
driveway all right we'll go that way it

134
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:53,269
will count to three one two three

135
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,670
down and knowing what it feels like okay

136
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,340
that's it for me

137
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:07,910

that's all the training tomorrow morning

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,290
I'll be flying you tune in tomorrow to

143
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,709
see me fly that flying plot in the

144
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,750
flying what do you call a Cheston flying

145
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,480
car flier define taxi I think is what

146
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,700
they're calling it - I'll post that's a

147
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,990
separate video I'll post that tomorrow
