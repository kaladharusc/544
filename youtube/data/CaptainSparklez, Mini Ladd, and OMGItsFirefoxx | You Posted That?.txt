13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,280
Ian: Beautiful music now, let's meet our three lovely contestants first

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,360
Ian: He's the weird halfway point between Bruce Banner and the Hulk. He's buff, nerd, and minecraft wizard

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,740
CaptainSparklez Jordan Maron!

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,900
Mini: Hello, hello. hello hello

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,500
Ian: Let's jump right into Round 1.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Ian: What's that called?

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,100
Ian &amp; Shayne: You posted THAAAT?!

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,760
Mini: Wow, nicely done
Sonja: It's good

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,940
Shayne: I know we practiced all night.
Ian: We did a lot of practice, yeah

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,060
Unkown: It's okay

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,760
Ian: Well, we did some deep diving in each of your Twitter accounts and pulled out some

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
tasty little morsels

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,620
Ian: However we have removed some of the key words, your goal is to fill in those blanks

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,660
with the correct words

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,680
Ian: If you get it correct, you get 5 points

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,700
[Keith Howl]

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,720
Ian: If you don't get it correct, well you get no points

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,700
[Keith Howl]

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,200
Sonja: All right

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
Ian: All right!
Shayne: All right!

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,980
Ian: Sounds fair!

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
Sonja: I guess. That's a fair- you have a fair system

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,580
Ian: Craig
Mini: Mhm

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,680
Ian: You're first
Mini: Oh god

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,940
Ian: On October 27, 2016 you tweeted

44
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,380
&quot;Blank at 1:40 AM? Screw it, we're in for an all nighter.&quot;

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,400
Ian: Sideways smiley face

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
Ian: Hmm
Shayne: It got a lot of likes

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,620
Mini: It was a solid tweet

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,260
Ian: People definitely agreed with your 1:40 AM choice whatever it was

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,080
Mini: Hmm

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,620
Shayne: Breakfast at 1:40 AM Would call for an all-nighter 'cause you're starting there. I mean you know

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,720
it makes sense

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,740
Mini: Let me go... I'm gonna go gym

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,840
Shayne: Gym?

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,220
Mini: Yeah, 'cause I always in the morning and go to the gym everyday. So that could be it

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,200
Ian: Is it gym?!

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Ian: It was ramen

57
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,440
Jordan: Craig, that black bar was too long for 3 letters.

58
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,520
Mini: I didn't know, it caught me off guard

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Jordan: How is gym gonna fit in that?

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,740
Mini: Well I mean at 1:40

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,860
Shayne: Ramen is arguably the opposite of the gym

62
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,700
Mini: It is!

63
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,600
Mini: Ramen used to be a religion for me, oh no

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,260
Ian: Way back a year ago!

65
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,760
Mini: I know

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,840
Shayne: Different times

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,560
Ian: All right. Sonja?

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,100
Ian: You're up next
Sonja: Great

69
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,420
Ian: On the 14th of November 2011
Sonja: 2012?!

70
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,200
Ian: Or 12?

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,880
Sonja: What?!

72
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Ian: Oh I was reading it wrong... great

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,840
Sonja: I didn't even know I have Twitter back then

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,340
Ian: You said, &quot;Pretty bum day. Ugh, I could use a blank.&quot;

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,560
Jordan: Can I just say? I think you have the world record for how many tweets

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,940
I've seen some tweet about being sick before

77
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Mini: Yeah, I'll give you that

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,000
Sonja: I travel all the time

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,160
Ian: Yeah actually we looked through her timeline quite a ways we're like &quot;there's a lot of tweets about her being sick.&quot;

80
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,660
Jordan: Exactly!

81
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,860
Ian: Are you okay?

82
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,440
Sonja: Okay, so if I'm having a bum day
Ian: Uh-uh

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,300
Sonja: What do I need?

84
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,200
Mini: A drink

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,540
Sonja: Ramen?

86
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,260
Shayne: I could use a ramen

87
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,280
Mini: One of the finest ramen!

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,620
Shayne: One strand of ramen, will be all I need

89
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,560
Sonja: That's all I need

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,600
Ian: Are you gonna say, a Ramen?
Sonja: No

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Sonja: I'm gonna go drink

92
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Ian: All right. Is it, I could use a drink?

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,620
Ian: How adorable

94
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,660
Mini: I'm sorry

95
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,660
Shayne: Something funny is, it got 1 re-tweet but no likes.

96
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:24,920
Shayne: Which means, someone saw and said &quot;I don't like this, but the world needs to know.&quot;

97
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,020
Ian: All right

98
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,740
Ian: Jordan?
Jordan: Oh boy

99
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,960
Ian: You're up now

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,180
Jordan: Oh 2016?

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,060
Ian: Yeah on 2016 August 11th you said, &quot;If anybody has any links to legit blank

102
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,120
that're totally legal and not illegal, I'd be forever grateful.&quot;

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,980
Sonja: Jordan what're you doing?

104
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,480
Ian: What the hell are you doing?

105
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Jordan: No it's something it's some-

106
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,280
Ian: Three words

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,940
Shayne: Three words

108
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,220
Jordan It's something vs something, probably like a boxing fight but I'm trying to think like what would

109
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,800
Ian: Box-ing fight?

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,440
Jordan: Yes, that

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,920
Ian: Yeah that makes sense right?

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,220
Jordan: It's not Game of Thrones, 'cause I have an HBO account

113
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,620
Jordan: But it's a small, like it's a vs or an of or something in the middle of there I know that

114
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,660
Ian: You're going to deep into it

115
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,160
Mini: Mhm

116
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,400
Sonja: Maybe you put Game of Thrones?
Jordan: I'm analyzing-

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,060
Jordan: If Craig had analyzed the length of his black bars, he wouldn't have guessed gym

118
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,760
Ian: This is the problem, when we invite gamers on they get way too competetive

119
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,740
Shayne: I know

120
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,480
Shayne: They're in it

121
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,900
Mini: Hmm
Sonja: Hmm

122
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,680
Shayne: What? What was that?!

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,500
Mini: I didn't mean that

124
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,620
Jordan: Mayweather and Pacquiao that was like, that was 2015

125
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,760
Jordan: Oh shoot, what other boxing matches or something like-

126
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,060
Ian: Do you only watch boxing?

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,260
Mini: Yeah

128
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,860
Jordan: No but I'm trying to think that would be, that feels like the only thing that I would not have pai-

129
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,260
Ian: Maybe it's- legit boxing TV Show

130
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,300
Mini: Boxi's Boxi Box

131
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,140
Mini: 'Cause I like boxes

132
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,100
Sonja: Jordan! Just pick one

133
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,540
Jordan: I don't know

134
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,260
Mini: We'll be back after these messages

135
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,900
Jordan: I know I'm not gonna get it

136
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,860
Sonja: Ramen vs Gym

137
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,100
Ian: We're about to give you a count down, so

138
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,120
Mini: Oooh
Sonja: Oooh
Jordan: Oh boy, oh boy

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,060
Jordan: This is really dramatic

140
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,300
[Clapping] + [Keith Howl]

141
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,460
Jordan: Game of Thrones

142
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,760
Jordan: I don't know what it is

143
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,060
Ian: Is it-

144
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,400
Ian: Links to legit Game of Thrones that're totally legal and not illegal?

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,260
Jordan: It's the Olympics!

146
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,140
Jordan: It was the Olympics

147
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,380
Jordan: Dang it!

148
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,320
Mini: We literally talked about this before coming out here

149
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,500
Ian: It's gotta be boxing, it's gotta be something manly

150
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
Ian: Nope, gymnastics
Mini: Nope, Gymnastics

151
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,020
Shayne: You missed the biggest sporting event

152
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,900
Jordan: God!

153
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,760
Jordan: How did- yeah the Olympics oh that one, right

154
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,660
Shayne: Yeah there's that

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,740
Ian: All right Craig
Mini: Mhm

156
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,100
Ian: You're up next
Mini: Oh god

157
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Ian: On the 22nd August 2017 so it's close

158
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,600
Mini: Mhm

159
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,380
Ian: You said &quot;Welp I just found out what blank are for. Now I feel like an ass for complaining about it.&quot;

160
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,960
Mini: Oh I know this no!

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,220
Ian: Upside-down smiley

162
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,920
Mini: Wait no! I know this 'cause people were talking [bleep] about me for it

163
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,660
Sonja: I remember this too

164
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,440
Mini: Yeah!

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,460
Jordan: Did you make a really big mistake?

166
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,840
Mini: Yeah!
Sonja: Yeah, he did

167
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,380
Ian: What do you think it is?

168
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,600
Mini: Amber Alerts!

169
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Ian: Is it amber alerts?

170
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,020
Ian: For the audience at home that doesn't know what an amber alert is

171
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,000
that is the alert when the child is abducted

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
Ian: And you get it on your phone

173
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
Mini: I'm not from here

174
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,600
Ian: And he was complaining about getting that

175
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,020
Shayne: Wait. So when it was showing cars, were you thinking it was a car deal or something?

176
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,880
Mini: I'm British, we don't get it in the UK

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm a d-ck I'm sorry

178
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,380
Ian: All right. Sonja?

179
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,480
Ian: On to you

180
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,660
Ian: On December 10th, 2011

181
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,160
Sonja: Why did you-

182

184
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,780
Shayne: That's a very 2011 tweet

185

Ian: It is the most 2011 tweet

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,580
Sonja: Yas pleease

187
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,580
Ian: What do you think it could be?

188
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,760
Sonja: Friends

189
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,600
Ian: Is it friends?

190
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,820
Ian: No it's Minecraft

191
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,020

Ian: You're just like, &quot;Yo! Tonight is gonna be LIT!!&quot;

194
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
Sonja: Wanna play some Mincecraft?

195
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,980
Mini: That needs to be in the time capsule

196
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,780
Sonja: Can I- Oh man

197
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,300
Ian: Last one to the round

198
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,320
Ian: Jordan are you ready?

199
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,380
Jordan: I don't know

200
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,240
Ian: Too bad

201
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,020
Ian: On August 4th 2017 you tweeted, &quot;Everytime I touch a blank in Las Vegas I feel the need to take a shower.&quot;

202
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,580
Ian: And that's 2 words

203

Jordan: Door knob

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,260
Sonja: That sounds correct

205
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,920
Ian: Wait what is, it doorknob or door handle?

206

210
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,280
Ian: Good job

211
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,900
Sonja: This is bs, I'm getting tweets from like 6 years ago

212
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,520
Sonja: And he's like &quot;what did I talked about last month?&quot;

213
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,660
Ian: I'm sorry, I'm sorry

214
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,760
Jordan: I very much stand by that statement also its recent

215
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,360
Ian: All right! Well, the points so far

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,700
Ian: Craig you have 5 points, Sonja 0, and Jordan you have 5 points! Good job

217
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,000
Ian: Now, let me take a quick break

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:17,280
Ian: Keith?

219
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,000
[ROASTED]

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,920
Ian: All right! On to round 2

221
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,900
Ian &amp; Shayne: Is this FUUNNNYY?!

222
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,600
Ian: In this round,

223
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,740
Whether you think they're funny

224
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,470
or not

225
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,380
funny if the majority teams are tweet funny that person will be revealed and they will get 5 points if your

226
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,470
Majority teams that tweet not funny

227
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:59,240
Then will you'll just be revealed for the unfunny person that you are

228
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,339
Alright, let's see the first funny joke sandy

229
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:09,680
They should have named it Snooki cuz it's gonna blow the whole Jersey Shore

230
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Hurricane jokes actually

231
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,990
Someone here, did this yeah, I wonder who's someone

232
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,500
Who's funny thumbs down if it's not done, but what year like now, don't worry this here. Don't worry about it

233
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,930
I know I mean without context. I appreciate how bad it is okay?

234
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,760
Alright we get one thumb up

235
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:46,680
Jordan you are the deciding factor. That's a lot of pressure doing what I think she's doing right now, No

236
00:10:46,680 --> 00:11:08,070
Either Craig is voting for himself or Sonya is self-deprecating because I didn't do this

237
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,640
Hey that has a lot of retweets proportionally

238
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:23,940
Retweeting it, but not liking it deal with that was 2012 that was very soon that was quick

239
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,510
Alright, let's see the next one this one said oh

240
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,870
I have a really good joke so you know how Twitter is implementing 280 characters

241
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,230
What if I type a tweet out and make it cut off before hahaha?

242
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,330
buddy

243
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:47,730
It's not

244
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,140
Alright, let's see the next one forgot to say I had a dream last night

245
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:59,160
And I kind of cyndaquil a Pokemon go and I was hunted down by the FBI for finding an extra in Pokemon whoa

246
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:11,880
So is that funny or not funny hmmm

247
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,390
Thank you

248
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:21,560
Sorry, I don't remember that tree. I'm sorry we searched long and hard for a joke on your timeline good work

249
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,780
It was tough, I know

250
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:37,940
All right, let's see the next joke someone should make a dating app called eBay

251
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,670
Chuckle, what's it gonna be?

252
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,970
Get some points sir all right, let's see the next one. I just need so hard. I somehow bit my tongue

253
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,620
I feel betrayed by myself wow

254
00:12:51,620 --> 00:13:00,710
That's just unfortunate. I don't think that's a joke though. That's unfortunate. Yeah. It's just some we tried hard to find jokes

255
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:22,730
Funny or not funny I feel bad

256
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,870
All right this was accompanied by a picture hashtag national girlfriend day time. That's Joey time

257
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,900
This person pumps iron how many times I've seen that yeah a little girlfriend day

258
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:42,650
Yeah, wow your girlfriend's been around dude

259
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:53,870
Your girlfriend's the same hand phone you're like what what are you doing?

260
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:03,140
It's at the door, that's like I'm sorry

261
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:14,180
You know I'm gonna what's gonna be?

262
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,860
a lot of people found that entertaining

263
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,930
Also I have to point out that at the time that you posted this I had a question

264
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,699
For you right there. I said, I don't get it. There's no girlfriend. Can you explain I?

265
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:35,329
Don't get the joke. Can you please explain it? Well you see what thank you?

266
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,829
You see what happens is that if you don't have someone else to help you with

267
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:40,970
things

268
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,949
like your movies

269
00:14:42,949 --> 00:15:01,759
You do it yourself

270
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,389
Your real-life humor on the Twitter yeah, I was gonna say Craig if only you could tell a joke like that on Twitter

271
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,860
Well

272
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,250
That's the end of round two Craig. You're still sitting at five points Sonya good job

274
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:52,529
Good job. No. Thanks to Craig well done Keith come on Scottie Pete

275
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:59,790
Okay, this is the final round all

276
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,360

Yeah

281

It's great right you can work on it in this round each

282
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:32,399
Of you will be presented with an amazing caption from an Instagram, and you'll be given three photos that it may belong to

283
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,790
Mm-hmm your job is the guess which photo that caption belongs to if you get it, right?

284
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,230
You get?

285
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,370
30 points

286
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:54,340
What these last two runs been pointless exactly if you get it wrong you lose 20

287
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,950
Craig oh I'm gonna start with you sounds good alright your caption is

288
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:06,520
New year new me oh god. This is and here are your photos

289
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Got me in a mullet mm-hmm. Got me looking like everyone's favorite Tommy Bahama dad

290
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,900
Mm-hmm and he got me just looking like a hot sexy man mm-hmm

291
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:22,150
Oh new year new me new year new you

292
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:34,210
They're all equally as arousing. I don't know right I can respect the double trim the first one that was that wasn't intentional

293
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:43,690
First one is it the first one with the moly that

294
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,850
Puts you at negative 15 points

295
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,560
The winner is gonna be whoever is at least negative now, yeah

296
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,840
Sonia all right you're next

297
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,670
Your caption is when you try to wear your hip friends accessories

298
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:06,250
Then remember you're just an awkward white guy those me and some awesome rectangle sunglasses me and Keith

299
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,960
Sunglasses and me with some just fastly sexy man. Not not really men's glasses

300
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,810
Do you ever wonder why you have so many pictures that can fit the same caption?

301
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,640
All right, so I think I mean I wouldn't enjoy the full zip up I

302
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,630
Respect the double chin again. I do I do. I'm kind of leaning towards that but I don't know what this situation is

303
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,160
Like no, it's all about these acessories Chin's anonymous. You know all right?

304
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:48,670
You know what you look like it like a sassy biker, man. I'm meeting with the first one is it the first one

305
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:54,060
