1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,790
all right here we go good night for near nice because you think they're he said

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,790
this guy a little babies in their internet

3
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,450
heavy on the loser board

4
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,340
I was going to write it in the pouring rain and then it's tap pulled up so

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,580
probably better than breaking the boosted board and safer

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,070
I'm not one to complain about the rain because nobody cares

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,670
but it has been raining in New York City for six straight days

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,540
don't get excited they're not mine

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,650
it's always the foreigners that can't figure out how to get this building can

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,729

11

12
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,630
but the best commercial next door it's so good and what that might be

13
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,009
that's totally fair Althea of two presents for you right here

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,020
