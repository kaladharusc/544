4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,799
look at the best of one of the most

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,599
requested actors we've ever covered on

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,550
the show and as tradition goes this week

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:20,270
we take a deep dive into his worst

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,430
Michael Keaton is absolutely an icon an

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,439
American treasure he's played Batman

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,300
Beetlejuice the vulture that guy from

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,830
mr. mop the list goes on

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,510
but as with any actor who's been around

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,669
for as long as Keaton some films and

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,500
performances just missed the mark but

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
which of these performances are the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,940
worst well in Keaton's case least best

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,700
let's find out these are the top five

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,629
worst Michael Keaton performances number

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,460

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,850
love this movie Jack Frost is on the

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,980
list Walter it's terrible you only like

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,870
it because you're too sentimental that's

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,680
not true

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,250

great on that show remember the

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:25,229
beginning of this episode Jack Frost is

30
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,479
the leader of his own upcoming band has

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,729
a beautiful wife a loving son and good

32
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,979
friends achieving his lifelong dream of

33
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,170
landing a record deal finally seems and

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,420
reach but it comes at the cost of

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,700
spending time with his family before

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,829
Jack can return home for Christmas he

37
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,200
dies in a tragic car accident a year

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
later his son Charlie builds a snowman

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,490
out of his father's old clothes and

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,610
please the harmonica he gave him before

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,369
he died through Christmas magic Jack's

42
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,380
soul is brought back in the form of the

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,780
Snowman Charlie just built Jack and

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,640
Charlie now have a second chance to

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,770
finally spend much-needed time together

46
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,460
where do I start with this movie it's

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,220
creepy and this is Keaton during that

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,289
point in the 90s when he was almost a

49
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,020
parody of himself

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,240
everyone knew his dick by 1998 and

51
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,040
nothing was unique about most of the

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,390
characters he was playing around this

53
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,090
time he's still charming and mostly

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,790
likeable as always but he needed a fresh

55
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:34,670
challenge Jack Frost wasn't it did you

56
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,440
just call me what bitch

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,030
well he does have a few decent scenes

58
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,190
with his son and the music is betta Blee

59
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,560
tolerable the concept of Jack Frost is

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,930
what portrays Keaton the snowman stuff

61
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,000
is too ridiculous and poorly done to be

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,440
effective in the way the filmmakers

63
00:02:48,440 --> 00:03:00,020
wanted it to be even at the end when his

64
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,540
body manifests himself again and we see

65
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,650
Keaton in the flesh it's just weird

66
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:13,410
[Music]

67
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,849
King Robert from Game of Thrones plays

68
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,640
his best friend - man that guy's friends

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,269
die a lot in any case Jack Frost is too

70
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,980
schmaltzy for its own good with an

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,050
inconsistent tone that fails to utilize

72
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,630
its immensely talented lead the correct

73
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,630
way well I still like it go for you

74
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,720
Walter good for you number four Raymond

75
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,989
Sellars in Robocop I'm sure we'd all

76
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,760
just rather forget this movie ever

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,459
existed but it existed and Michael

78
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,380
Keaton was in it in the near future

79
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,390
robotics technology has advanced to the

80
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,610
point of military use overseas

81
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,530
however the creators of this technology

82
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,599
Omnicorp and their leader Raymond

83
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,579
Sellars are trying to bring the robots

84
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,590
home as in use them for law enforcement

85
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,560
in the United States this is heavily

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,180
fought by Congress until a police

87
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,400
officer named Alex Murphy is critically

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,620
injured in an attempt on his life with

89
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,760
the permission of his wife

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,709
Omnicorp makes him a cyborg with the

91
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,660
intent of using him in the field the

92
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,400
results don't go as planned when Alec

93
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,260
shows that his human side is still

94
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,600
intact and his emotions continue to play

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,760
a big role in his job as the first human

96
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,600
flash robot cop Keaton is largely wasted

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,610
as the film's villain we've seen him

98
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,950
play some really complex bad guys in the

99
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,560
past but Sellars doesn't have much to

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
him his motivations aren't anything we

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
haven't seen a million times before in

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,639
these types of characters he's a greedy

103
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,650
businessman who wants to make more money

104
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,450
by selling his robots to police

105
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,000
departments all over the country nothing

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,090
and no one will get in his way blah blah

107
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,850
blah blah blah he's mostly reserved in

108
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,010
this role with only a few Keaton isms to

109
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,380
brighten up a dreary boring remake that

110
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:02,070
seemed to miss the point of the original

111
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:09,210
make a more tactical

112
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,279
let's go with black there are some big

113
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,379
names in this cast in addition to keaton

114
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,809
samuel l.jackson and gary oldman have

115
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,389
sizable roles also Chucky Errol Haley

116
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,150
and Jay Baruchel make appearances Joel

117
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,770
Kinnaman playing the titular character

118
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,559
didn't have much to work with looked

119
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,569
like he could have used some backup

120
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,080
this is katana she's got my back I would

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,509
advise not getting killed by her her

122
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,650
sword traps the souls of its victims

123
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,569
number three

124
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,419
Doug Kinney and his clones in

125
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,830
multiplicity now we have our own

126
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,779
experiences with duplicates on this show

127
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,039
but for Michael Keaton's sounds great

128
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,319
right a Los Angeles construction worker

129
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,849
named Doug Kinney has a tough time

130
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,099
juggling his demanding job with family

131
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,439
life while on the job site a scientist

132
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,389
offers to clone Doug to make his life

133
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:01,990
easier

134
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,580
Doug goes through with the procedure and

135
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,949
a clone is created the clone handles

136
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,689
work while Doug spends more time with

137
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,479
his family a little too much time Doug

138
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,219
quickly feels overwhelmed by his new

139
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,959
house husband responsibilities and

140
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,689
creates another clone this clone takes

141
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,459
care of the household duties while Doug

142
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,680
looks to try and relax but the original

143
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,899
clone eventually clones himself and a

144
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,749
third damaged clone is made with for

145
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,099
Doug Kenny's out in the world

146
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,169
the original must balance them and his

147
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,180
family while keeping the secret from his

148
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,099
wife maybe that sounds a little

149
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,020
confusing but as a comedy the movie

150
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,149
definitely embraces the absurdity of its

151
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:39,249
premise Harold Ramis directed this and

152
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:41,259
there's actually a lot I like about the

153
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,419
film and Keaton's performances it's not

154
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,550
easy to create four distinct characters

155
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,319
all bouncing off each other in different

156
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,629
ways as the film goes on each clone

157
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,520
develops his own persona separative Doug

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
too becomes the macho one three becomes

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,550
the effeminate one and for well for like

160
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,399
people like it

161
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,649
I started out kind of hating this movie

162
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,539
and Keaton seemed to be on autopilot but

163
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,339
as we progress through the story there

164
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,129
are some legitimately funny bits look at

165
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,410
me okay

166
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,400
look ah that's a lot of ribs was that

167
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,730
like a slab or something brushing that

168
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,560
general read you but I did my mom bowed

169
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,050
out of there unfortunately it's not

170
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,880
quite enough to keep these performances

171
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,860
off the list a lot of the interactions

172
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,720
are clunky and the effects stick out as

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,330
very dated while his clones are humorous

174
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,520
they only rely on one personality trait

175
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,020
toward the beginning of the movie the

176
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,790
first clone thinks he is Doug when he

177
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,650
first wakes up this still could have

178
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,750
been a comedy if we explore that angle a

179
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,340
little more that would have been more

180
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,410
interesting and less reliant on gags

181
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,570
while these performances are definitely

182
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,370
on the worst list I would recommend

183
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,780
checking out the movie it's a funny

184
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,610
comedy with more Keaton's than you can

185
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,790
hit Ted we're in destroy Ted let's bring

186
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:06,660
Ted down yes number two

187
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,420
Johnny dangerously in Johnny dangerously

188
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,610
did you guys know 30s gangsters wear

189
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,510
eyeliner Johnny Kelly is a good

190
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,550
upstanding kid but when his mother gets

191
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,290
sick and needs money for an operation

192
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,390
Johnny decides to help out a local crime

193
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,370
boss to come up with the cash he takes

194
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,320
on the name Johnny dangerously and it

195
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,790
sticks with him into adulthood

196
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,340
now Johnny lives two lives one looking

197
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,110
after his mother and brother and the

198
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,180
other as an infamous criminal when

199
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,580
Johnny's brother Tommy becomes DEA he

200
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,410
starts cracking down on crime which

201
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,300
means the mysterious Johnny dangerously

202
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,250
is on the top of his list to take down

203
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,229
Johnny has to find a way to protect his

204
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,580
brother from other criminals while not

205
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,140
letting Tommy know that his big brother

206
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,960
is more than just a nice guy this is one

207
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,640
of those parody movies from the 80s that

208
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,620
was hit or miss the director of giant

209
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,780
dangerously Amy Heckerling was also at

210
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,310
the helm for hits like Fast Times at

211
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,530
Ridgemont High and clueless keith was a

212
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,480
younger man when this came out in 1984

213
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
and I just don't think he had his

214
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,670
trademark persona 100% down yet see you

215
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,740
breaking your mother's hot Tom white I

216
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,160
mean why my name is dangerously Johnny

217
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,290
dangerously the movie is weird and the

218
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,120
jokes don't work well nowadays in my

219
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,040
opinion but for all the wacky stuff

220
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,690
happening throughout this film I thought

221
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,280
Keaton would have been more off-the-wall

222
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,950
nuts his delivery is flat compared to

223
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,760
what would come later

224
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,379
and

225
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,569
we as a whole was a bit of a slug to get

226
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:29,639
through definitely one of Keaton's

227
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,269
subpar performances and the number one

228
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,139
worst Michael Keaton performance is

229
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:39,509
monarch in need for speed have you guys

230
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,059
ever played the need for speed kicks

231
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,429
well the movie is pretty bad after

232
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,409
street racer Tobey Marshall is framed by

233
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,939
another driver for unintentionally

234
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,069
killing his friend he spends two years

235
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,349
in jail when he's released the only way

236
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:53,970
to prove his innocence and get back at

237
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,409
the other driver is to beat him in a

238
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,029
high-stakes underground race called the

239
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,459
de Leon to get to the de Leon Toby has

240
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,139
to make it through bounty hunters and

241
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,389
cops looking to stop or kill him

242
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,209
Keaton's character monarch is some sort

243
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,889
of mysterious underground radio

244
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,899
personality who runs the de Leon and

245
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,729
announces it to people streaming it live

246
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:14,369
I'm not sure what he was going for with

247
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:18,989
this but it's not good Daryl no it's my

248
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:21,720
show I get shut up listen to me Michael

249
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,239
Keaton is an inherently cool guy he just

250
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,669
is he's one of those actors that people

251
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,889
like the personality of no matter what

252
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,679
role he's in in Need for Speed I don't

253
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,209
know if he was just trying too hard or

254
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,069
the direction was to blame but the

255
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,439
monarch character gets worse the more

256
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,539
times he shows up the thing you can

257
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,639
understand is great things in art dude

258
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,379
that's high art I have no idea where

259
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,369
this is going I just know what I like

260
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,289
y'all can walk home we all know most of

261
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,299
these are nitpicks Michael Keaton is one

262
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,159
of the most iconic Hollywood actors who

263
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,959
was still going strong to this day I

264
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,819
think we can all appreciate the talent

265
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,350
he's brought to any film he's been in

266
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,139
good or bad if you missed it last week

267
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,879
over on my personal channel I have a

268
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,439
discussion about something I've been

269
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,839
thinking about for years we all know

270
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,489
Keaton was a great Batman but what his

271
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,199
natural personality have been a better

272
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,449
fit for the joke join me over at
