1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,590
this movie exists ah just what we need a

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,960
gritty neorealistic reboot of the King

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,269
Disney logo once upon a time in the

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,430
hidden heart of France narration also

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,560
France has a hidden heart no country is

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,180
not even the size of Texas and Texas as

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,619
hard is where the stars at night are big

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,180
and bright so that's definitely ain't

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,359
hidden oh how divine that's right kids

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,980
there's some extra singing in this book

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,779
so that we can pad the runtime and sell

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,790
more tracks on iTunes clean this is 100

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,809
games I'm starting to worry about

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,790
stanley tucci becoming typecast as that

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,280
dude that wears the wigs or that dude

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,160
will do anything for a paycheck well has

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,899
a door right behind the throne in the

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,820
throne room and why is it a lot also we

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,260
know that there's a big-ass front door

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,789
on this castle but the enchantress takes

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,350
the side door to properly buzz kill the

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,300
entire shindig repulsed by her Haggard

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,449
appearance the prince and the woman away

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,039
yeah he's a dickhead but he's also

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,570
probably pretty pissed this old lady

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,219
crashed his party demanded a room and

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,049
waved a flower in his face when he

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,150
dismissed her again the old woman's

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,790
outward appearance melted away to reveal

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,350
a beautiful enchantress entrapment also

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,880
it's already maddening that I'm watching

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,560
the exact same thing story is the

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,210
animated movie that came out 26 years

34
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,040
ago it's exactly the shopper shop remake

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,409
of psycho in 1998 only if a movie that

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,759
featured Vince Vaughn jerking off had

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,560
made over a billion dollars and placed a

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,060
powerful spell on the castle and all The

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,470
Enchantress gave the Prince to putting

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,030
chances in five minutes to not be an

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,740
asshole and because the asshole every

42
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,240
motherfucker in the vicinity was screwed

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
The Enchantress had erased all memory of

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,259
them from the minds of the people they

45
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,060
loved that's an excellent attempt achill

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,500
as a plot hole opened by the animated

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,149
movie but it leaves me with a whole new

48
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,619
set of questions did The Enchantress

49
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,240
also erase all physical evidence of

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,619
their existence including portraits

51
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,659
letters or things they made and I'm sure

52
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,009
some mothers and fathers worked in the

53
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,540
castle that their spouses suddenly think

54
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,770
storks brought them their children or

55
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,079
they were miraculously conceived if not

56
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,540
he would be doomed to remain a beast for

57
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,880
or at least until the next reboot sequel

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,470
which should be coming out in roughly 14

59
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,920
months everyday like the one before

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,950
harmonious Hermione everyone in this

61
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,420
town opens up their window and doors at

62
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,920
the exact same time even though there

63
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,330
are occupations like bakers and

64
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,130
policemen like that which should be

65
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,920
working at a much earlier hour Oh JA

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
background public intoxication

67
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,470
incarceration is background how do you

68
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,410
know something again I believe I have do

69
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,640
I really need to point out that everyone

70
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,930
in this movie that sit deep in France

71
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,790
has English accents except for Lefou and

72
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,620
Lumiere I guess so the director said

73
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,820
here let's have you eat an apple in the

74
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,230
scene we'll make it look like even more

75
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,240
of an S hey that's an actual ass eating

76
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,360
an apple holy just gonna be trolling us

77
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,650
this lyric made sense when adults were

78
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,820
singing it in the original movie but

79
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,200
having a bunch of kids mark shame Bell

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,910
makes me think Bill Condon promised all

81
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,200
his nieces and nephews they could

82
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,450
totally be in his movie I can't tell

83
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,980
who's a bigger dick in the situation the

84
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,540
girls for singing about how weird Bell

85
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,250
is right in front of her or Bell for

86
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,510
almost stepping all over their clean

87
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,190
clothes Jesus movie I know you probably

88
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,840
had a large floral budget but this is

89
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,290
all the flowers look at challah through

90
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,510
my future wax we interrupt this musical

91
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,590
number to bring you some good

92
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
old-fashioned Disney sanctions talking

93
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,100
ever since the war I felt like I've been

94
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,690
missing something you know what the

95
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,130
first movie was missing more unnecessary

96
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:29,690
guests on backstory even for this movie

97
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,590
simple

98
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,940
[Music]

99
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,610
King millenials another easy

100
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,550
buckwheat Ron Jesus Christ Murray's even

101
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,990
gets a cool song in this version that's

102
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,610
next an aria from that chick that's it

103
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,350
Bonjour a few minutes ago police not

104
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,700
only sketches his daughter obsessively

105
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,440
he also has a miniature model of himself

106
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,700
painting the painting that's hanging

107
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,110
right beside it I think I prefer the

108
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,970
crazy inventor that adorably everything

109
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,560
up Maurice from the last movie Joe

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,130
Maddon's was fearless I dan this movie

111
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,090
about a girl that's captured by a

112
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,710
magical beast takes forever to actually

113
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,620
beast so what can I bring you from the

114
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,570
market they'll spent all morning at the

115
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,160
market at which every conceivable item

116
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,170
was available edible or otherwise but

117
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,760
Maurice is hitting up yet another one in

118
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,440
order to finally kick this plot he asked

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,560
teaching another girl to read isn't one

120
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,220
enough

121
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,780
that's books just have to taste am I

122
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,130
looking what the punishment for teaching

123
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,750
a young girl to read is to empty out all

124
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,790
bells laundry on the street these tell

125
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,990
silk have gone from singing about how

126
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,430
curious Bell is the outright public

127
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,410
humiliation well I wanted to teach a

128
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,300
child to read beauty in the dangerous

129
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,250
mines on the Beast the only children you

130
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,950
should concern yourself whether your own

131
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,450
Ruby can't decide if it wants to pad its

132
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,250
runtime with a ton of extra songs or a

133
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,720
pad its runtime with a ton of village

134
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,700
centric tomfoolery but by god it will

135
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,380
tad its runtime

136
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,580
Boldin by the success of another emma in

137
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,930
a recent musical emma watson is

138
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,790
perfectly fine with being just ok at

139
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,440
singing yeah if that's the village way

140
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,940
back there bill just covered at least a

141
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,440
mile on foot within two measures of the

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,940
song if the opening credits are an

143
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,260
indication bill should have an excellent

144
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,610
view of the magical kingdom from up here

145
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,650
you know where we awful Eve was I doubt

146
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,390
for ease goes to the same market every

147
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,190
year you ask about every year

148
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,810
every year you bring it but this time

149
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,610
not only gets lost he seems completely

150
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,970
unconcerned about it

151
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,919
Sulli pecks not gonna also come the gone

152
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,330
these old we're standing there ready for

153
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,800
a tasty dave to fall off the clip

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,810
there's a much bigger and meteor target

155
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,800
that's apparently standing right in

156
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,400
front of them

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,960
since this movie suffers from the exact

158
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,669
issue about the castle being in plain

159
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,169
sight I'll just repeat the same sin I

160
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,729
gave the last movie the Beast has only

161
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,319
been secretly feasting for ten years but

162
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,880
my race is somehow unaware of this very

163
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,979
nearby castle also it's super weird that

164
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:36,910
the villagers wouldn't be at all

165
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,259
disturbed that the Prince of the very

166
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,699
nearby castle hasn't been seen or heard

167
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,590
from in years and even if this princess

168
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,000
a peculiar cluesive you'd think that

169
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,590
someone would know one of the 300

170
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,970
live-in servants and wonder where they

171
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,310
are right right also in the last movie

172
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,930
this event occurs almost eight minutes

173
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,460
earlier so you see what I mean what the

174
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,050
whole pad the runtime thingy okay I know

175
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm being hard on this movie mostly

176
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,539
because it sucks and was completely

177
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,250
unnecessary but I will give it credit

178
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,810
for looking freaking beautiful set

179
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,120
design and the castle is unbelievable oh

180
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,740
thank you

181
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,319
I know Maurice is supposed to be kind of

182
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,789
an idiot and movie does half the movie

183
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:08,169
but why the hell would Maurice think

184
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,630
this meal is for him good night wait

185
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,669
roses promise Bela Rose Marie stops to

186
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,110
get Bela souvenir from his horrific

187
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,639
ordeal at the castle so they can both

188
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,139
look at it and cry together in terror

189
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,810
hey pan this works but what if she is

190
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,969
the one the one who break this bad

191
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,530
Lumiere has all three of his candles lit

192
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,820
when it's broad daylight but was

193
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,289
flameless last night when Marie's came

194
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,159
back maurices cough could have come from

195
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,870
anywhere in the castle but bill goes

196
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,280
directly to the tower where he's held

197
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,599
this is the best father-daughter

198
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,180
echolocation trick since taken to now go

199
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,710
before she finds you Oh Maurice plays

200
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,120
the burndown game so that we can get a

201
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,409
properly dramatic introduction to the

202
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:47,680
beast

203
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,400
punish me not him no he means forever

204
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,349
apparently that's what happens around

205
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,930
here when you pick a flower damn all the

206
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,099
sudden it's apparent that Maurice would

207
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,880
be excellent at sin offense now I won't

208
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,159
let you do this yeah I'll totally be

209
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,690
fine just got a terrible disease that

210
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,580
will disappear the minute I leave this

211
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,470
castle

212
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,670
me everything I am is because of you

213
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,200
bill rubs it in maurices face that he

214
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
single-handedly made her into a moody

215
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,490
wander listing social pariah alo beauty

216
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,870
and the beast' franchise continues its

217
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,340
curious tradition of giving the voice of

218
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,260
Lumiere to anyone but a French dude it's

219
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,120
man of yours it's dangerous

220
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,470
ignoring the fact that Belle is well

221
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,180
within earshot what about Linear's plan

222
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,770
seems dangerous trying to set the beast

223
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,240
up with the one woman that's come by to

224
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
the castle right before the last petal

225
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,480
of the flower drops sure you may be

226
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,950
pissed at the beginning what else is

227
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,750
Lumiere supposed to fucking do wait for

228
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,960
the next one to come by good one I feel

229
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,160
I need be thought this opera singer

230
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,510
turned wardrobe thing wasn't weird

231
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,250
enough so it gave her narcolepsy are all

232
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,140
these flying fabrics also sentient if so

233
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,670
why do they have less individuality than

234
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,320
the fucking dog footrest what are the

235
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,610
rules

236
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,030
[Applause]

237
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,620
Tom Josh GAD choose the route of the

238
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,330
scene and in this instance it is not a

239
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,210
good thing I eat five dozen eggs so I'm

240
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,550
roughly the size of a ball

241
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,780
this song is a great example of why a

242
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,220
movie is so stupid

243
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,480
the use of animation to make these

244
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,100
preposterous claims as a million times

245
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,750
more fun than watching Josh GAD and his

246
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,840
invisible wires fell she's locked in a

247
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
dungeon who's gotta even in desperate

248
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,530
situations Maurice simply cannot stop

249
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,320
playing the pronoun game Al Murray what

250
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
indication is the movie given us that

251
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,200
Maurice is crazy he's a widower that

252
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,090
makes pretty amazing trotsky's and cares

253
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,590
for his daughter even though the movie

254
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,909
is over two hours it ain't got time to

255
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,820
explain that he's don't all the come see

256
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,349
I didn't think it was possible but they

257
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,030
actually made the Beast less likable in

258
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,380
the beginning of the first movie also

259
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,849
I'm going to go ahead and give the BCG a

260
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,350
perspective soon for how cheesy and

261
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,460
dated it's going to look in ten years

262
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,560
also why did they have to CG the Beast

263
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,360
there are a million ways to dress Dan

264
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,950
Stevens up to look realistic via

265
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,870
costumes and practical effects but this

266
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,520
will fuck it was mostly done windows 98

267
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,830
paint program and when she opens the dog

268
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,070
give her a dashing debonair smile come

269
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,510
come show me the smile show me the girl

270
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,730
mirror isn't also thank God the Beast

271
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,870
looked in on bail when she wasn't

272
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,040
continuing to try and climb out the

273
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,570
window which for some reason she stopped

274
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,000
doing i gue to be more feathers and I

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,850
just like yesterday I know darling I'm

276
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,820
getting more metallic every day oh it's

277
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,310
perfectly good got a feel for the castle

278
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,720
staff but this was the worst day

279
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,670
Enchantress could do I mean I guess I

280
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,080
understand changing the Prince into a

281
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,730
beast for being a dick but why did she

282
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,839
turn the staff into furniture and

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,430
appliances even if you were trying to

284
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,080
punish them for some bizarre reason why

285
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,240
aren't they also animals how lovely

286
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,760
tonight your acquaintance Nanny McPhee

287
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
isn't Jessica Fletcher at the scene

288
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,370
aah gasps Bianca Jota sell this to the

289
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,200
test hearing an inferior version of a

290
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,520
classic Disney song you've heard a

291
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,720
million times it's like listening to

292
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,310
Justin Bieber try and sing like Kurt

293
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,810
Cobain um believe me

294
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,180
I the D shed so all the dishes also

295
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,010
servants in the house and if so would be

296
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,330
difficult to ask them anything because

297
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,920
they're almost just normal dishes

298
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,120
the only discernible difference these

299
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,830
dishes have two standard dishes is that

300
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,060
they can fly in coordination to a

301
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,560
musical number and if these dishes

302
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,180
actually have human souls trapped inside

303
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,890
of them then what happens when the spell

304
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,839
is broken is the entire castle suddenly

305
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
devoid a flatware and fine china on hold

306
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,610
yeah man damn it if only Bell spoke

307
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,770
French also loop this menu there a

308
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,180
character here that would be able to not

309
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,560
only will depend but perfectly print

310
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,250
Lumiere

311
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,200
cloth napkin dance is a PSA on how not

312
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,840
to do fire safety ah those good old days

313
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,230
when while you swung a Cogswell they'll

314
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,120
smile is saying I appreciate the effort

315
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,380
of the musical number but I haven't

316
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,060
eaten in days and would prefer to just

317
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,500
have a nice hot meal in peace and this

318
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,970
ornate fanfare is keeping me from it

319
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,350
literally strangely doubles down on the

320
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,030
psychedelic teapot scene that was so out

321
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,980
of place in the animated version Lenina

322
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,140
truly Lumiere offers a tiny amount of

323
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,790
food to the woman he's been openly

324
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,200
tempting for the entire length of a

325
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,360
Disney World ad holy beast feels the

326
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,190
need to candle got some candles just

327
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,840
nobody trying to tell me by showing me

328
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,760
this is this a bed now has he been

329
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,410
eating a deer right here and leaving the

330
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,180
antlers this is a failed arts and crafts

331
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,390
project man what are you doing getting

332
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,820
out there which is shockingly easy to do

333
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,160
Elle is easily disarmed by CGI fakery

334
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,990
seriously I guess these wolves aren't as

335
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,610
bad as a Scorpion King or anything but

336
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,840
it's clear the movie blew its effects

337
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,070
budget on that be our guest showpiece I

338
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,090
just beat so good at fighting other

339
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,830
beasts when The Enchantress enchanted

340
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,270
him it was really all just about

341
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,650
appearances right so it's not like he

342
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,000
should have Wolverine like abilities

343
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,560
against these wolves shot looks less

344
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,060
like beasts about to faint and more like

345
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,430
there's a glitch in the computer yes

346
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,710
beasts just save Belle's life and yes we

347
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,760
got to get this creepy love story

348
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,770
started but for reals why the hell would

349
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,480
she not run here he's literally said one

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,470
nice thing to her during her

351
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,089
imprisonment and that was under duress

352
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,070
from a servants let's say this did just

353
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,660
get up walk over and hop on top of a

354
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,280
leap how is Philippe able to walk after

355
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,720
his experience with the wolves plus

356
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,790
carrying a 400-pound beast on his back

357
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,400
it was downed by lightning at the time

358
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,089
but now it's resumed an upright position

359
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,800
I guess the forest also has something to

360
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,240
gain from the curse being broken since

361
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,770
it's currently in with Maurice and

362
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,930
making him look insane to Gaston and all

363
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,480
the other townspeople that way

364
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,360
definitely that way I'm done playing

365
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,260
this game

366
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,300
Bill's Gaston wrote all this way with

367
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,070
maurice but gets fed up right before the

368
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,870
entrance of the magical forest you'll

369
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,940
soon have been in a West Wing well you

370
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,400
should learn to control your temper fell

371
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,990
sick burn is much more painful with a

372
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,610
beast than the wolf bites when the

373
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,130
master lost his mother and his cruel

374
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,790
father

375
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,400
twisted him up to be just like him we

376
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,709
did nothing and that is why we were all

377
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,720
including my young son just asking to be

378
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,910
cursed forever also does anyone expose

379
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:40,010
out of earshot in this movie this number

380
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,820
is for all the people that were

381
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,470
clamoring for a lost childhood song to

382
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,660
be added to the original soundtrack from

383
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,700
the last back-and-forth the master

384
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,500
remains a beast forever

385
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,560
and we become antiques what kind of bold

386
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,660
enchanting is this bull after the flower

387
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,610
petals fall the Beast keeps beasting for

388
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,709
all time but the staff die god damn lets

389
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,150
us do price to pay for not intervening

390
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,690
and a kid's abusive upbringing

391
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,350
[Music]

392
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,339
who've you forgot about the last time a

393
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:05,390
petal fell when there was a minor

394
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,770
earthquake in the castle that the staff

395
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,030
all recognized thank thank you I guess I

396
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,320
guess that makes a rare appearance here

397
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,180
too ex machina Marisa situation that

398
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,530
remind us that she's a character that

399
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,910
will likely do the same to the whole

400
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,470
movie by the end of it are you making

401
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,990
jokes now so has Belle just put away all

402
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,280
thoughts of escape even though if she

403
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,230
was easily able to do it before even if

404
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,370
she wants to help and get the staff back

405
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,900
to normal she's still digging around in

406
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,580
the librarian starting up beast eale

407
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,990
romance instead of doing anything that

408
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,530
would be helpful

409
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,290
he was mean he would coerce non-risk

410
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,300
fine but that was way back yesterday so

411
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm sure he's worked all who stopped

412
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,830
waiting small yeah who knows with this

413
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,390
pace bill may be pregnant by then a

414
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,060
little gift

415

The Enchantress book Trudy Nagi to

416
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,540
escape but I think in Contra stop by

417
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,740
after cursing the fuck out of these

418
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,690
folks and dropped off a gift some

419
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,120
clueless printable yeah except for

420
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,890
cursing the hundreds of innocent people

421
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,060
agile a book that allows you to go

422
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,710
directly to certain places is totally

423
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,510
different than a boot or Triwizard cup

424
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,070
or a statue head or anything else that

425
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,500
rhymes with short Pete this is the Paris

426
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,710
of my childhood movie throws yet another

427
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,390
unnecessary song at us that you probably

428
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,830
won't remember within five seconds of

429
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,700
watching this movie what's the one story

430
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm talking have a bring himself to tell

431
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,500
I need better than talk what even know

432
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,550
what happened to your mother because

433
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,050
your dad appeared ooh joked up about it

434
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,580
to tell the story and for that reason

435
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,050
you never were compelled to ask or

436
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,130
demand to hear it works for the

437
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,400
screenplay but it makes no fucking sense

438
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,870
you must leave now

439
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,600
Disney says give kids childhoods we're

440
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,430
gonna go all plague on their asses I'm

441
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,640
sorry culture fathers see so bygones

442
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,320
then they'll can go back to Marines and

443
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,340
not be a prisoner for the rest of

444
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,230
eternity yes some if you try to kill

Maurice last night everyone was calling

446
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,890
more he's crazy but now he comes in and

447
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,420
impugns the most famous person in the

448
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,010
town and everyone believes him even a

449
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,440
little cheese the one main character is

450
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,690
the one cliche instead of a date beast

451
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,280
and Belle agree to get dressed up and

452
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,630
have a good old-fashioned staring

453
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,380
contest

[Music]

455
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,860
the animated version has much more

456
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,480
amazing camerawork and movie magic than

457
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,029
this retread but this does have 97% more

458
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,829
move busting like at the coat rack talk

459
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,269
some of the staff members were turned

460
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,130
into mute versions and some work so does

461
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,240
that mean The Enchantress went through

462
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,990
them one by one

463
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,190
oh girl time so much pause I was the one

464
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,990
who had it all

465
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,370
beast spends what he thinks are his

466
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,930
final moments ratcheting up yet another

467
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,310
forgettable addition to the soundtrack

468
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,079
damn they still have Maurice at the bar

469
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,209
he was accosted by Gaston Scoones way

470
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,529
back before the Beast even took a bath

471
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,209
then he and Belle got all dressed up

472
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:35,949
danced the discount Peabo Bryson had

473
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,930
their talk mirrored broke up and beast

474
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,750
had time to sing an unnecessary song

475
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,130
from the breed close-up look of Maurice

476
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,420
in the mirror that showed him struggling

477
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,069
Belle was not only able to glean his

478
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,690
exact location but timed her entrance to

479
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,730
perfectly intercept the asylum wagon the

480
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,180
monster has under his spell if I didn't

481
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,459
know better I'd say she even cared for

482
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,350
him this is a ridiculous assumption to

483
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,209
make on Gaston spark I know he's a sandy

484
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,800
puddle but he's still trying to get with

485
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,360
Belle right so why throw her under the

486
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
bus in front of a whole town everyone's

487
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,190
all bloodlust Dion but no one has a clue

488
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,720
about where the castle is even if the

489
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,980
mirror shows the castle itself it

490
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,750
doesn't show the route also is it

491
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,370
Maurice vindicated now no one's saying

492
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,199
he's under the Beast spell so why does

493
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,250
he have to stay locked up in the cart

494
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,540
there's one thing this town does

495
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,100
exceptionally well it's mobilized an

496
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,449
angry mob they got ready for this beat

497
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,339
on like a NASCAR pit crew as the movie

498
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:22,990
progresses the time to get between the

499
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,579
village and the castle is shrinking took

500
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,019
more than half a day for Maurice to get

501
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,399
out there in the first place but by this

502
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,870
point the villagers can make it back to

503
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,180
that in less than a song on foot I know

504
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,190
what happened to mammal even though the

505
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,600
castle is under attack we've still got

506
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,160
time for some backstory both about

507
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,399
Belle's mom sorry old friend it's hero

508
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,410
time instead of continuing to attack

509
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,480
Gaston the castle staff lets him whittle

510
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,360
equip all over the floor yeah it's

511
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,380
shocking how Pirates of the Caribbean

512
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,269
this thing ends up feeling Castle begins

513
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,769
crumbling like the boss level of some

514
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,149
Super Mario game for no other reason

515
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,100
besides adding suspense movie was

516
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,660
definitely going for the record of most

517
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,339
edits within a rooftop jumping sequence

518
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,720
but unfortunately still came up short

519
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,959
too Captain America Civil War Strega are

520
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,329
coming this gets a little presumptuous

521
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,250
about how this night is gonna end it was

522
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,900
an honor to serve with you

523
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,260
the owner was mine

524
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,480
main characters are fully objectified in

525
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,829
the order of their caste billing because

526
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,569
we need to see the first of many curtain

527
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,380
calls in the school movie I love you

528
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,670

529
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,380
chantry's was within earshot to express

530
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,790
her love for the Beast I mean if you're

531
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,230

532
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,970
plot in motion then showed up right at

533
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,320
the last minute to right all the wrongs

534
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,850

535
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,390

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:03,570
