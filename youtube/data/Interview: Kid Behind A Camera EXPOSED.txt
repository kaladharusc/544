00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,740
talk about the clickbait I want to talk

38
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,820
about the grain because I want to talk

39
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,440
about all are you sure you're okay with

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,830
that

41
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,950
yeah dude all right well what are you

42
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,840
talking about again well let's start

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,160
with some of the white okay let's start

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,500
with something like let's talk about the

45
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
clickbait nature of your videos because

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,320
this is the thing I solve most

47
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,270
frequently and it's the lightest

48
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,160
accusation why do you click because I

49
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,570
will tell you I'm a fan of your video as

50
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,790
I watched every Engler grandpa video I

51
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,430
watch the vlogs from time to time and

52
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,840
even I don't know what to expect when I

53
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,800
look at a video the video you I made

54
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,870
said I cheated on a bridge which is

55
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,490
technically true cuz you and I kids it's

56
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,470
just what I'm having sex bridge it's not

57
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,170
mad well still kissing somebody is

58
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,040
cheating is it not

59
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,380
I get that bothers but my question is

60
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,720
why why do you do that what's the point

61
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,330
well most basic answer I can give right

62
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,519
now just to that one point is what else

63
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,050
mine I am I gonna call the video I

64
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,239
kissed boogie2988 you know if I make

65
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,300
sure that's not as interesting mode

66
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,310
later we have a problem

67
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,819
when

68
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,799
YouTube and I'm there's no way you don't

69
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:23,499
know it okay there's a major problem on

70
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,120
YouTube where I know it they don't know

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
it there's a major problem on YouTube

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,010
where you have to click me and if you

73
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,019
don't click pay viewership is gonna drop

74
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,959
an interruption drops and everything - I

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,180
don't want to have to look babe I wish

76
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,090
YouTube wasn't the platform that it is

77
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,680
that where I have to click bit every

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
video I don't want to do that man but

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,159
you told me at one point like you were

80
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,010
each ride not click baby just like

81
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,569
titling it what it was is something

82
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,879
about like going on a tour dying or

83
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,519
getting Chinese food and if you said

84
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,810
with the views are down what percentage

85
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,599
it dude when I went to New York City a

86
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,459
couple of years ago so number one a lot

87
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,989
of people that say that like I'm only

88
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,909
click baiting now I've always done it

89
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,889
it's always been a thing that I've had

90
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,109
to do to survive on YouTube and back

91
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,400
when I went to New York City I was like

92
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,409
you know what I'm gonna not click play

93
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,750
this blog and see how it performs and I

94
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,639
call it a tourist crap and bomb-ass

95
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,639
Chinese food and then to this day is the

96
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,930
least performing video I've ever

97
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,780
uploaded but this is how bad it was okay

98
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,819
usually when I upload a video I'll wake

99
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,000
up and it's at like 180,000 I woke up

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,939
and this one was at 22 Jesus you know

101
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,120
that's a dramatic drop and how you doing

102
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,069
that again you know that you missed it

103
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,569
and that's the thing I think I feel like

104
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,759
my audience hates the clickbait because

105
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,079
I don't click base so they're not used

106
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,489
to it but I think your audience is used

107
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,959
to it at this point because I've read

108
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,909
your comments you said you you read your

109
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,030
comments rarely right yeah it's most

110
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,620
people's like common feel is just like

111
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,449
talks total tucks it right and ours are

112
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,370
not the same on that level I I get a lot

113
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,930
of positivity in the right videos when

114
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,340
most of the time it's very negative

115
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,290
stuff which is reasonable I get that but

116
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,579
sometimes I consider to be fair

117
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,949
criticism I don't know sometimes I don't

118
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,449
feel like the criticism you're getting

119
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,579
is fair but but your audience it's used

120
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,930
at this point clearly they're watching

121
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,370
you're getting three times the views I

122
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,519
get you know I'm very fortunate and the

123
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,560
fact that like I've had a steady

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,829
view number always on my channel when

125
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,599
Dad was alive I would average between

126
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,030
180 and 250,000 views

127
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,540
and I'm still averaging between 180

128
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,950
250,000 views of log and I think the

129
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,750
reason that you know that is is because

130
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,120
the ones that do support me the ones

131
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,070
that I do love and and I love the haters

132
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,380
too but the ones that that I ride or die

133
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,930
with us they don't care about the titles

134
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,820
because are they gonna get annoyed yeah

135
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,980
it's a crappy title that sucks but the

136
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,260
video is good I try to make only good

137
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,230
content that I like vlogs that make me

138
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,910
laugh if I don't laugh there's some

139
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,440
times I don't upload a vlog because I

140
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,450
didn't laugh right like you know what no

141
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,640
upload today and that hurts me to do so

142
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,930
the nature of your vlogs okay that's

143
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,460
another thing that I've seen is that

144
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,580
beyond the clickbait um nobody ever

145
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,230
knows like what's real and what's not

146
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,090
real are you really sick do you really

147
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,860
have diabetes are you actually trying to

148
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,090
lose weight this times and you end up

149
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,220
not losing weight

150
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,010
what are you walk it away for this do I

151
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,280
gotta do it right I got diabetes

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,800
Mike yeah right we just had to stand by

153
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,970
blood sugar by the way Michael's blood

154
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,250
sugar was lower than mine I was clocking

155
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,410
at 120 Michael's talking at an 83 this

156
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,550
morning so he's doing better than me

157
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,620
he's less diabetic than me right now I

158
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,150
mean like there's some stuff and I've

159
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,250
said this some keemstar I've said this

160
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,020
on every Avenue that's been asked to be

161
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,540
there's stuff on our blogs that you have

162
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,140
to notice staged you have to know that

163
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,000

out about losing his bad I mean this is

188
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,140

192
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,580
and see it hurts to talk about it I get

193
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,140
it you know like he's but some of the

194
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,480
accusations Michael like 48 hours after

195
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,610
he dies you have a t-shirt that says

196
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,190
rest of the piece grandpa is that a real

197
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,450
thing is that a real t-shirt you had

198
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,550
yeah it's a real that's not me I don't

199
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,430
design the t-shirts that was BroadbandTV

200
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,590
now here's what happened when Dad was

201
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,320
dying you know before he went to the

202
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,300
hospital he really wanted to do

203
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,130
merchandise and I did not want to do it

204
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,510
I never want to do because I don't think

205
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,640
people would buy it I always thought

206
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,250
like for instance when VidCon asked me

207
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,780
to come do like an autograph signing I

208
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,820
said no because I don't want to be there

209
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,160
and there's three people there to see me

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,350
and it's embarrassing so I didn't want

211
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,760
to put out merchandise because nobody

212
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,350
would buy it it would be humiliating and

213
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,480
so a month before I dad went to the

214
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,520
hospital he's like Mike let me run the

215
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,200
merchandise I'll take care of it

216
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,030
whatever so I got him in touch with

217
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,070
broadband TV they sign these contracts

218
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,320
and we were under contract to sell

219
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,450
merchandise for broadband TV and dad's

220
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,720
sick in the hospital a month later and I

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,540
thought it was gonna die what she did

222
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,150
but not as soon as I thought so at

223
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,580
Thanksgiving I'm talking to him and he's

224
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,690
like Mike I don't know if it's long ago

225
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,670
a guy and I've never told this story he

226
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,080
said Mike I don't know how much longer I

227
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,020
got so talk to the people and see if

228
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,940
they can work with a tribute Church

229
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,600
really I didn't know that there told it

230
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,570
I don't want to do it he's always

231
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,930
telling me like film this video and save

232
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,760
it because one day I'm gonna be gone

233
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,970
like no I want to talk about my dad all

234
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,350
the time I can't help it

235
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,560
he was my advice you know he was my rock

236
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,900
and like if I'm vlogging and I start

237
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,720
crying what I'm gonna not vlog that day

238
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,190
you know what I mean that's just what

239
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,020
happens to me but the shirt

240
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,539
dad said hey maybe you should make a you

241
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,160
know tribute shirt and I did I was so

242
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,900
against that he's like Michael you have

243
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,280
to look at the fact that I'm not going

244
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,870
to be here much longer and I did not

245
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,900
like to the end that was fighting that

246
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,630
because he had such a horrible bed sword

247
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,980
he was in misery he was screaming in bed

248
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,390
but this is this is one of the ways that

249
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,100
your dad tried to take care of you you

250
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
wanted to make sure that you know you

251
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,720
had money if if your dad was here today

252
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,320
you could call him wherever he is would

253
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,900
you know him better than me would he be

254
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,610
okay with the videos you've made it

255
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,260
would he be okay with the merchandise he

256
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,670
was sold would he'd be okay with it

257
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,990
because that's what it really comes out

258
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,700
it doesn't matter the audience cares if

259
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,590
they are okay with what would your dad

260
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,810
think let me tell you dads quote this is

261
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,900
a 100% quote anytime something would

262
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,910
happen that would say anything for a

263
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,360
video really he was a youtuber he knew

264
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,090
clickbait like when YouTube trying to

265
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,380
kick him off with a platform first

266
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,750
cussing what was his first video since

267
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,810
'red video to YouTube talking about them

268
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,580
cutting him off of the platform

269
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,270
he was a youtuber he you know he would

270
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,830
talk when I grew up with a video he

271
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,600
would say hey hide that video do I did

272
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,040
too good oh God

273
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,910
you know I'm over Mike he was he was

274
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,850
anal about the views he was anal about

275
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,100
everything eat like one of the things

276
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,870
I'm sure you're gonna ask where they

277
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,350
fake right I'm right

278
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,820
cuz that ties into so much that ties

279
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,850
into so much for one sec so let's say

280
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,780

00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,529
never excessive like they try to say it

325
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,540
was never like you know he wouldn't use

326
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,480
weapons wouldn't physically abuse us he

327
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,779
was very angry right he did a lot of

328
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,740
messed-up crap I've told people on video

329
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,569
Christmas morning one time somebody ate

330
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:11,180
his cheese and he swung butter against

331
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,370
the wall took the tree down threw it in

332
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,779
the front yard and went into his room

333
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,220
for the rest of the day and this is like

334
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,449
one of the trailer parks oblivion do

335
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:18,889
this wasn't like a nice house like with

336
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:20,449
Christmas presents fill in the house and

337
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,120
we never lived in to be nice houses we

338
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,730
were if you can imagine how poor family

339
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,639
could be we were poorer than that like

340
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,189
mom wasn't working dad was living on

341
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:33,649
Social Security benefits and that went

342
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,809
to the bills and left nothing for food

343
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,850
for we lived on government assistance

344
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,850
our entire lives man we had absolutely

345
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,160
nothing and you're right it is an excuse

346
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,959
you know dad being poor and nine hundred

347
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,589
pounds and angry about it he took it out

348
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:52,699
on those kids all the time he was a

349
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:56,110
raging alcoholic now there was a day

350
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,510
when all that stopped

351
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,100
94/95 he took his last about alcohol

352
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,060
quit cold turkey

353
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,980
he was like I'm never taking another sip

354
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,780
again and it didn't and he got better

355
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,860
right

356
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,920
they tremendously better man you know

357
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
like night and day here's the way you've

358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,640
portrayed him on YouTube and I think

359
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,290
this is the source of the obligation of

360
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,140
the way you portrayed him on YouTube he

361
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,730
was such a nice guy destitute good guy

362
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,230
who's capable to do such nice things

363
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,820
like least even he wasn't giving money

364
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,220
to charity we see given given money the

365
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,830
fans abused spoiling those grandkids to

366
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,040
some extent so is that all fake if

367
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,450
that's what I one of those fake I don't

368
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,830
care if the rage is hurt I think I don't

369
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,720
care if he's genuinely smashed in your

370
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,610
play stage where I care about is he

371
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,500
hiding some secret is he beating the

372
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,760
hell out of you is he beating the hell

373
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,290
out of the kids and then trying to make

374
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,150
up for it what's the situation with all

375
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,430
of this like it's that stuff fake the

376
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,730
charity stuff the like not only is the

377
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,560
charity stuff not fake I didn't know

378
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,700
people weren't even saying that by the

379
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,860
way like not only is the charity stuff

380
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,170
not fake but there was so much extra

381
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,520
charity stuff that nobody knew about

382
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,030
like dad was against filming a lot of

383
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,370
the charity stuff we did he did he

384
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,200
thought that by doing that and I'm

385
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,790
guessing that's what's happening now he

386
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,500
thought by showing anything we did

387
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,090
nights we would be doing infernal

388
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,410
terremoto right so there was one time

389
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,150
one of our fans wrote us and they sent

390
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,100
us a GoFundMe link and they said hey my

391
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,600
house burned down can you share this

392
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,090
link they need a $5,000 dad sent him all

393
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,730
the money they paid off the GoFundMe

394
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,990
account and we've never talked about

395
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,790
that on video we keep in touch with that

396
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,560
person they came to wonder grandpa's

397
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,960
BBQs that's crazy

398
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,700
their house burned down there were kids

399
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,650
lost everything and dad paid it off like

400
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,070
that because I think this is one what

401
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,630
kindled our friendship is that my mom

402
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,950
was very similar in a lot of ways that

403
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,950
behind closed doors with me she was a

404
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,770
really rough person I choose here's

405
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,150
something else I want to say my mom was

406
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,250
a angel to her grandkids we'll talk

407
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,520
about that but to me she was a monster

408
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,710
but then she taught preschool and she

409
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,300
was an angel to this kid she would go

410
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,730
out of her way to spend her money to buy

411
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,410
Christmas presents to spend money to

412
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,000
make sure their families had

413
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,980
Thanksgiving she would intervene and get

414
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,620
these kids to get off welfare the

415
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,460
parents get off welfare

416
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,649
the real jobs they would get the parents

417
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,420
who are not have an income on the

418
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,060
welfare they would cultural services to

419
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,950
get people out of home if they needed to

420
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,230
and so everything I've ever learned

421
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,180
about your dad he had that same

422
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,520
dichotomy he was very very good to

423
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,170
everybody else but when he came home to

424
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,459
you guys he was pretty rough I mean that

425
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,700
goes for like mostly just the two oldest

426
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,250
siblings right you know me and Dad I was

427
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,060
a shadow

428
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,600
he was net he was only great to me I was

429
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,790
the one that didn't smoke I was the one

430
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,380
that didn't drink I was I was the one

431
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,720
that was good in school listened so I

432
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,370
would go with him to flea markets and

433
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,500
sell in the weekends and we would do

434
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,390
anything we had to do to make a buck we

435
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,980
were ride or die together and that's how

436
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,690
it was till the end me and dad had a

437
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,550
great relationship till the end my

438
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,230
sister Kim he and you know he and Kim

439
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,790
had a better relationship than the other

440
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,070
two it's it's sort of like as he got

441
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,740
older it got better so with my first son

442
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,120
he was in the you know one of this

443
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,980
worked with my brother Charlie he was in

444
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,830
the pit he pitted me of his alcoholism

445
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,930
he was at the height of it and he was

446
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,150
angry all the time and then my sister

447
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,100
came and that's a second mouth to feed

448
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,959
and there's no money to feed it with and

449
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,029
then Kim comes and he's starting to get

450
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,650
a little better and then I'm here and

451
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,110
all of a sudden things are changing and

452
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,350
in his whole like demeanor is changing

453
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,310
as he gets older

454
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,650
like he's softening as he gets older

455
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,800
basically you know so at some point he

456
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,930
had full custody of the grandkids yeah

457
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,330
oh there's five grandkids somebody have

458
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,490
custody of all five was it just for me

459
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,730
yeah he even had custody till he died

460
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,250
and so my question is Michael they see

461
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,950
that side of your dad other than on the

462
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,270
vlogs other than on the grain your

463
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,160
grandfather is when he was along with

464
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,930
those kids was he throwing stuff was he

465
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,130
yelling at those kids

466
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,310
yeah so I've only shown like one clip

467
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,220
ever of this it was in a video when we

468
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,470
were talking about some problems we were

469
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,329
having with Tina Dandridge a chick a

470
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,420
lady that wasn't one of our

471
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,929
and in that video I showed a clip of dad

472
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,480
at one of Jacob's graduation ceremonies

473
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,939
he's was graduating the first grade yeah

474
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,530
and Jacob's walking across the stage

475
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,720
period thinking about it he's walking

476
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,069
across the stage and he's a caller ID

477
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,400
Jacob what they didn't know is dad would

478
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,100
every PTA meeting that went to every

479
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,429
award ceremony every event at the school

480
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,100
every parent-teacher meeting every call

481
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,950
he shoved those grandkids were his life

482
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,669
and do you think there's a chance people

483
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,820
more calling the SS on us I can imagine

484
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,320
they probably got called least a couple

485
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,429
times I wish it was a couple of times we

486
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,169
had a standing appointment with the SS

487
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,320
really the Department of Social Services

488
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,040
how many of your friends have they

489
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,179
called thousands per month thousands per

490
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,890
month we're calling he's angry grandpa

491
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,230
he did this today he broke plates and

492
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,910
the SS would show up they have to

493
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,520
respond to those calls so every time

494
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,250
they would come to our house and they

495
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,900
would investigate they would talk to the

496
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,120
kids they would talk to dad they did

497
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
their due diligence they never closed

498
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,940
the case because there were so many

499
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,820
calls coming in and they never took the

500
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,040
kids once I know you have custody who

501
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,020
gets full custody yeah I have custody

502
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,150
and I branched that off to my sister I

503
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,860
had permission from DSS for them to live

504
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,870
with her but I've retained full custody

505
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,419
until she can like get it back herself

506
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,880
yeah so that leads me to the million

507
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,470
dollar question Michael this is

508
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,150
something I get accused of all the time

509
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,090
look you people are abused or abusive

510
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,559
and I've certainly thought a perfect

511
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,990
person and I have PTSD I have anxiety

512
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,880
issues I I could definitely disassociate

513
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,380
I could be not a great person so mostly

514
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,660
Michael are you abusive man are you

515
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,540
using me kids well first I wasn't abused

516
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,030
as a kid oh that's right I was yeah

517
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,530
you're saying I was the golden child

518
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,150
right so everything that dad did for

519
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,140
those grand

520
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,960
he wanted to give them what he couldn't

521
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,740
give us we had nothing bro no and he

522
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,490
wouldn't like we had nothing and when we

523
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,010
finally were able to have something he

524
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,740
one of those kids to not like live

525
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,409
without because we lived without so much

526
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,140
right and I continued that now you know

527
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,779
because you got custody kids I asked you

528
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,429
once like how much of your money you'd

529
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:34,470
save and you said you had hardly

530
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,360
anything safe that's still because we

531
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,529
were talking you had a video saying

532
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:39,330
you're like born broke yeah I called you

533
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,559
up I don't like Michael is this real and

534
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,690
you're like yeah dude I have barely

535
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,750
anything safe tell them why that is tell

536
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,630
them what I mean I take care of

537
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,000
everybody in my family when Dad was

538
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,980
alive I was paying all of his bills not

539
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,750
to mention he gets half of the YouTube

540
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,480
money right he gets half of that like a

541
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,590
lot of people don't know that Michael

542
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,600
stealing from his dad dad got half of

543
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,429
the YouTube money part of it had to go

544
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,919
for taxes and then a lot of what I had I

545
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,019
was paying for my mom's life I'll paint

546
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,630
dad's bills my sister in New York needed

547
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,399
help sometimes I'll give her money right

548
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:13,350
I take care of everybody in my family

549
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,580
that needs help and friends there were

550
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,929
friends who say hey can you help me out

551
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,860
I I don't like seeing people like

552
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,049
without because I had so little growing

553
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,630
up so if I can afford it I'll give it

554
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,980
you know anything so obviously the bare

555
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,090
necessities for these great kids

556
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,440
obviously the clothes and the school

557
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,210
clothes and the school supplies and the

558
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,610
food and so values for these kids - I

559
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,220
see yeah they get the the gaming systems

560
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,870
they get the iPads they get everything

561
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,529
that they genuinely want right yeah but

562
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,090
that's nothing like cover up something

563
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,519
awful going on like you need so okay so

564
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,470
those people are saying like I don't

565
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,880
know I don't know what I did to be

566
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,130
honest it's a question I'm asking mostly

567
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,960
because that's something I'm accused of

568
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,460
all the time that boogie must have been

569
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,200
abusive to his ex-wife because he was

570
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,490
abused so well obviously is abusive

571
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,279
right and so that's my question like

572
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,470
there's no secrets you're not covering

573
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,360
up anything no idea jess is involved

574
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,830
they would are they still involved just

575
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,779
dude people are calling now more than

576
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:07,289
ever

577
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,570
why you do anything for those kids i

578
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,240
watch your video of course not but we

579
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,779
have we live in this like world

580
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,909
where these like trolls on the internet

581
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,710
just want to try to make your life as

582
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,299
miserable as I and there are those

583
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,769
people but I will be honest with you my

584
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,809
audience especially I think a large

585
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,099
personal audience they're genuinely

586
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,599
concerned about me they're generally

587
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,399
concerned about whether I'm hurting

588
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:28,809
people in my life taking advantage of

589
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,399
people in my life I'm sure there's

590
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:31,869
people out there generally conservative

591
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,729
yeah here's the thing a lot of people

592
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:35,679
accuse me of accusing everybody of being

593
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,840
a troll and that's not true when I

594
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,279
respond to somebody on Twitter and I

595
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,379
call them a troll I do my homework I'll

596
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,179
go to their profile I'll go down there

597
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,639
tweet timeline you know and I'll see Oh

649
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,850
lot of people will say if that's what he

650
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,529
thinks is appropriate to show for the

651
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,710
video what is he not showing I mean do

652
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,110
you guys fight off-camera is it worse

653
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,980
when you have you ever never how dad

654
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,830
raised me a man puts his hands on a

655
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,139
woman is it a man at all and I believe

656
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,649
that I would never lay a hand on Bridget

657
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,889
have you know I have a thing and bridges

658
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,659
probably when we're arguing is she don't

659
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,700
want to let it go she wants to keep

660
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,169
doing this when I'm ready to walk away

661
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:14,879
I'm like you know what i'ma go to the

662
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,409
room I'm gonna listen to music she

663
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,659
follows me into the room you know but in

664
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,759
terms of like as bad as it gets

665
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,480
the vlogs are one whether the real or

666
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,690
not is you know up in the air right

667
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,299
right it's up in the air that's for you

668
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,889
to decide but number two I'm just gonna

669
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,389
say I'm just going to say clearly

670
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,919
sometimes when you guys are having a

671
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,379
slow day I see you pick a fight with her

672
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,119
for no other reason than just to have

673
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,490
content I knew just going to say that

674
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,379
you're not my personality off videos

675
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:45,570
okay right the things that like our uber

676
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,190
driver writes okay alright you just like

677
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,990
the place like that exactly I like to

678
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,850
mess with people and sometimes I get

679
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,529
enjoyment out of mess more Bridget a

680
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:53,909
little bit I don't I mean like over like

681
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,340
a you know I saw that look you gave me

682
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,789
right what what look that look in the

683
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,220
rock didn't exist I'm having fun but at

684
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,309
some point in my having fun she's so mad

685
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,929
that now I'm mad

686
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:10,379
even though I created this dynamic I

687
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,539
created it now we're fighting but in

688
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,860
terms of like real fights not that many

689
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,940
because you guys have been together for

690
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,299
10 years

691
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,519
I only made it seven with my ex-wife you

692
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,139
guys been together a decade there's been

693
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,759
times where I wanted to head out I'm

694
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,190
done you know but it's never gotten to

695
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,600
the point where I want to lay a hand on

696
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,809
her like I've never like I've broken

697
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:34,730
stuff definitely it's like if I'm pissed

698
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,220
I'll break something and that's not okay

699
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,770
you know I'm a university but I a lot of

700
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,809
that was probably 2013-2014 and I've

701
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,370
gotten a lot better at coping with that

702
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,540
but I would never lay a hand on

703
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,700
Bridgette I would never like sometimes I

704
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,200
do have anger problems in the worst

705
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,700
thing that I do is I say stuff that I

706
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,299
shouldn't say I I do that to you I get

707
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,240
that for sure I'd have a firefly complex

708
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,510
right right and I don't flight I have a

709
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,700
fighter but I will say anything that I

710
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,960
have to say yeah

711
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,760
anything that's rust we have to save it

712
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,710
any time that we that we get into an

713
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,020
argument my brain is telling me oh we're

714
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,520
breaking up this time I'm just gonna let

715
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,290
it all out and I say stuff that I don't

716
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,260
mean I say 12 stuff to her I'll say some

717
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,250
of the stuff that people are saying

718
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,440
about her and she doesn't deserve it and

719
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,309
I've kind of hurt her like self-esteem

720
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,410
some in some ways with that but I've

721
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,290
apologized and I don't do it anymore you

722
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,250
know it's it's the old me and I'm it's

723
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,630
one of the things that I do have to work

724
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,040
them because I did grow up in a house

725
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,410
where dad did do that to my mom he he

726
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,570
was verbally abusive absolutely I mean

727
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,790
I've never hid that from anybody you

728
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,450
know anybody like that's just the

729
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,250
dynamic I grew up and and part of me

730
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,390
sort of thought that was okay and dad of

731
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,740
all people as one who told me to stop

732
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,340
doing it

733
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,440
first because and that's the thing and I

734
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,360
barely knew your dad I never got to meet

735
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,280
the guy but that's something that we

736
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,320
talked about he softened up so much once

737
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,419
he was out of that trailer park once

738
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:06,980
they weren't desperate to make ends meet

739
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,179
once they weren't desperate to provide

740
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:10,250
for the kids and the grandkids I mean

741
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,450
that man became a completely different

742
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,830
person yeah I make no uh no attempt to

743
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,450
hide the fact that YouTube changed his

744
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,350
life yeah I said it in his eulogy that

745
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,370
the last ten years of his life I am so

746
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,320
happy that I was like because of the

747
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,970
youngins and because of the fans and the

748
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,520
trolls to a regard I was able to give

749
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,080
him a life that I never dreamed I would

750
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,960
be able to go you know I thought that

751
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,150
when Dad died we would be in a trailer

752
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,880
and it would be really sad and we'd be

753
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,090
struggling to like find a way to bury

754
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,890
him yeah and with those last 10 years

755
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,140
that's not what happened man something

756
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,160
flipped and like we found purpose and we

757
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,340
found this audience that loves us and

758
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,010
they loved him I didn't know I didn't

759
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,500
know how many people loved him it was so

760
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,640
unbelievable

761
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,030
like I guess thinking about it man

762
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,460
people loved him because I'll tell you

763
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,340
what I loved about your dad is as I said

764
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,860
very much saw my mom as much as I hated

765
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,929
the things my mom did I loved that woman

766
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,740
and I could see that your dad was torn

767
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,890
between his abusive nature the the

768
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,600
verbal abuse of the the Tantrums and

769
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,210
everything else and genuinely loving you

770
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,040
kids and genuinely caring about you and

771
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,780
genuinely want to provide for you and

772
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,520
provide for the young uns the fans and

773
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,500
the kids and and interact with these

774
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,570
people and it's so amazing than the last

775
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,400
ten years of his life he got to enjoy

776
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,559
that I talked you so much off-camera and

777
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,110
heard so many stories about him just

778
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,870
becoming a much better person like the

779
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,820
person he was always trying to be he got

780
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,290
to be that before he died and that's

781
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,280
because of you too

782
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,260
so one of the things that I see you

783
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,460
accused of all the time I can accuse of

784
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,910
this stuff as well is racism and

785
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,130
homophobia and and and and your dad I

786
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,860
mean obviously is a 67 year old man so

787
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,600
there's gonna be some innate racism

788
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,679
there I mean that guy lived through

789
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,260
segregation for God's sakes but but

790
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,610
beyond that he was he a racist person

791
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,010
net weight Oh gives some of your videos

792
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,840
I've seen clips of videos that make it

793
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,240
look like he's these railing harassing

794
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,770
Mexicans do you know entire kind of

795
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,690
image talking about that's the border

796
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,770
patrol videos those were skins Wow okay

797
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,150
that I mean like in the early days of

798
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,280
YouTube you would do real stuff makes us

799
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,130
kids right I mean obviously I did too we

800
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,809
all did that you know and one of the

801
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,460
skits dad wanted to do back in the time

802
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,799

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,750
actually an illegal immigrant and dad

810
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,220

811
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,559
wash the house and try to help his

812
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,720

813
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,490

nephew's got like a kitchen set or

843

something for Christmas or something and

844
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,860
I think he did make the comment it go

845
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,190
big a know dad was in support of gays

846
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,620
he was LGBT you know I don't know

847
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,990
probably a few yet he was totally in

848
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,610
support of Wallace up you know name a

849
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,289
but at the time because there is also

850
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,789
videos where he's being supportive of

851
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:25,830
oppressed groups these are other people

852
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,139

857
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,019
many examples it's just he wasn't like

858
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,940

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,029
you ever marched the petition be well

862
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,070
there is the thing that happened during

863
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,320
the civil rights and civil rights era

864
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,350
there was this March in Charleston and I

865
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,509
don't I don't know who was marching but

866
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:59,730
they were walking down West Ashley and

867
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,009
dad let them get into his car yeah just

868
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:03,929
like open backed car and they were able

869
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:05,490
to get on the back of the car and he

870
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,590
drove them down the street and he ended

871
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,780
up with a newspaper

872
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,409
your dad kicked out of his house his mom

873
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:13,549
would have nothing to do with them she

874
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,830
was racist his mom was totally racist

875
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,900
right she kicked him out of the house

876
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,940
said she never wanted to speak to him

877
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,190
again and he took off and he went to

878
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,100
Woodstock for like he was young like a

879
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,289
young man he runs off to Woodstock and

880
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:29,270
he doesn't come home for another two

881
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,760
years so I think a lot of people yeah

882
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,530
I'm being a 44 year old guy the world

883
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,419
has changed a lot right yeah and so

884
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:36,950
sometimes I think when people accuse me

885
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,809
of like being racist or homophobia scuzz

886
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:41,059
I don't understand it sometimes but I

887
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,559
always have the best of intentions and I

888
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,630
thought I think your dad had the best of

889
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,520
intentions of course even with the

890
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,870
border trooper troma do obviously we

891
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,970
would make that video 2018 there's a lot

892
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,340
of David in 2009 there's a lot of videos

893
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,990
that you would make then that you

894
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,159
wouldn't make now the landscape has

895
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:56,929
changed so much right back then we

896
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,640
didn't ask ourselves hey it's just gonna

897
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,890
offend people we never asked that cuz we

898
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,750
didn't care you know we wanted to do

899
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,760
something that was funny right now it's

900
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,929
like wait a minute is this gonna offend

901
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,580
people you have to ask these question I

902
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,780
don't even worry about offending people

903
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,799
because people are gonna be offended

904
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,210
that I anything you do what I worry

905
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,340
about I don't to cause actual harm right

906
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,320
well one of the reasons I toned down the

907
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,890
phrase this bit is because I don't want

908
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,850
people thinking that's how I actually

909
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,500
act right I don't want I don't want to

910
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,330
think it's okay to act that way and so

911
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,740
that's why I wouldn't make a Border

912
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,090
Patrol video today because I don't want

913
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,770
to I don't want to incentivize those

914
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,539
guys or make them normalize that I make

915
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:31,669
those guys think it's okay right to be

916
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:33,470
that way it's like in the same vein as

917
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,830
you have this Jessie character right oh

918
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,299
yeah I love it I mean I can't do many

919
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:40,580
more right so like you know does that

920
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,539
make you racist or white supremacists or

921
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,700
any of that stuff of course not there's

922
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,960
a character that was the whole thing

923
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,220
about the Jessie characters he was

924
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,809
progressive he was a progressive redneck

925
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,580
right they have a gay kid and he loves

926
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,470
his gay child and you know even though

927
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,330
the church tells a lot to the brothers

928
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,679
you can even bring up the topic of

929
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,880
racing where you can't bring up the top

930
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,110
of snow anymore

931
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,510
especially as you know someone who's

932
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,070
straight and white and male like you

933
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,750
have to be really careful that stuff and

934
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,240
so I that's well that's why I think it

935
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,500
really comes down to is we wouldn't make

936
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,270
those videos anymore because we don't

937
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,740
want to cause any problems gonna hurt

938
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,879
anybody and we certainly don't started

939
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,559
that's the thing like everybody accuses

940
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,089
you loving contours you start a

941
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:20,499
controversy that could be the most

942
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:21,759
controversial thing you can do in the

943
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,879
world right yeah and and obviously you

944
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,079
would never really fun I hate

945
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,289
controversy man like it like I get so

946
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:31,240
tired like they're always being a fight

947
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,909
in a battle and a fire to put out you

948
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,579
know I mean like that's YouTube in 2018

949
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:39,240
yeah man it's like great it's like

950
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,259
sometimes you just want a way out

951
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,089
sometimes you know it's like because

952
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:45,069
there's so much to deal with and they

953
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:47,379
accuse you so much somebody lies and

954
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,419
it's like that's I might come off a

955
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:51,309
little jaded in this video and I don't

956
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:53,289
want to I don't mean to be aggressive

957
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,269
you're defensive but I mean I get why

958
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:56,859
you're defensive I'm throwing it all at

959
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:58,299
you right now I get when it comes to

960
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:59,799
like being defensive about me I don't

961
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,299
care you know you can accuse me of

962
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,579
anything I'm defensive for dad because I

963
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,109
know how good of a person eat well

964
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:07,749
that's his legacy exactly and then

965
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:09,339
they're trying to change his legacy you

966
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,420
know here's a story I don't know if

967
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,519
we've ever told Dad was the bus driver

968
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,089
for our church and West Ashley and he

969
00:35:16,089 --> 00:35:17,499
goes to pick up the kids for Sunday

970
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,809
school and there was this little black

971
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,200
girl she wanted to get on the bus and

972
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,599
dad wasn't gonna tell her no come on in

973
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,450
honey right on the bus and he took her

974
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,140
to church and they fired you're kidding

975
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,849
he was no longer the bus driving here

976
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:36,279
was that I don't I never asked I have

977
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,839
heard the story a couple of times but

978
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,579
they kicked him out of the church they

979
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:43,809
ostracized the entire family and they

980
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,279
told the little girl she had to go home

981
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,589
I mean I'm not surprised I grew up close

982
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:48,759
to where you are I've heard this stuff

983
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,700
all the time you know I got I got

984
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,499
tortured for dating a woman to call her

985
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,660
in my team so I get it but there's stuff

986
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,210
like that that I saw the side of dad

987
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,609
there's stuff like when like Trayvon

988
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:01,480
Martin

989
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,910
when George Zimmerman was found not

990
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,920
guilty and I saw dad actually cry

991
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,180
off-camera he cried because this kid's

992
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,980
dead

993
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,319
this guy's clearly racist this is

994
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:17,200
clearly racially motivated and it broke

995
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,849
that's hard there's been police

996
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:22,150
shootings dad's always been off camera

997
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,980
and on

998
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,579
on that side when Barilla pasta was

999
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:27,869
saying they don't want gay people buying

1000
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,550
their pasta he never bought another

1001
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,960
Barilla noodle again

1002
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,540
really he stopped buying them we did a

1003
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,040
video where he took them all out it and

1004
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,300
this is 100% real

1005
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,130
sometimes our videos sometimes I hate my

1006
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,660
kids what I want to do and he wants to

1007
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,690
rant a little bit this one film and he

1008
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,300
took marilla pasta he threw it broke it

1009
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,280
and he screamed and he was a hundred

1010
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,890
percent serious good was he you know did

1011
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,690
he do stupid stuff on camera of course

1012
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,450
we all have or we all had videos we're

1013
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,720
not proud of but there's tons of videos

1014
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,470
I regret making so many oh my god I look

1015
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,570
back on it I was a stupid person

1016
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,150
sometimes you can't you can't control

1017
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,800
who you were then you know what I mean

1018
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,460
right

1019
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,980
we've said super stuff there's a video

1020
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,290
that I to this day regret making where I

1021
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,960
look at a picture of Jesus I took

1022
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,030
silly-string he was like you Jesus and I

1023
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,670
spray whoa I was trying to be edgy and I

1024
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,810
used to have like an upside down

1025
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,820
American flag in my room I thought I was

1026
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,430
so is here James gun woman right right I

1027
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,160
thought I was so cool and different and

1028
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,079
I look back now like I heard a lot of

1029
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,880
people doing that you know I should have

1030
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,450
done that

1031
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,119
the upside-down Americans like you know

1032
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,680
people died for them you know what I

1033
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,270
mean but I wasn't looking at it like

1034
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,650
that I used to say all the countries of

1035
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,470
distress man that's why it's up I don't

1036
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,760
know what I was talking about of course

1037
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,440
you know and that's and that's that's

1038
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,000
the reason I'm always in a position you

1039
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,369
use sometimes you say I back down too

1040
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,990
easy I'm always in a position where I

1041
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,240
want to learn if I if I'm doing

1042
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,980
something wrong genuinely wrong I want

1043
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,569
to learn what I'm doing wrong I want to

1044
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,819
get better right cuz I haven't far from

1045
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,890
perfect guy I've been but as I was

1046
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,420
growing up I was as far from perfect did

1047
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,520
you get I was a monster in my 20s man I

1048
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
was a terrible terrible person doing

1049
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,300
some of the same stuff I would argue

1050
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,920
with my friends who are Christian trying

1051
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,240
to destroy the Christianity because I

1052
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,440
couldn't have that comfort why do they

1053
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,510
deserve it you know right but now as an

1054
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,819
adult I've learned from and I'm eager to

1055
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:19,619
learn too but I think you've learned so

1056
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,990
much and to know where you've come from

1057
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,060
with your dad and in that home and in

1058
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,710
that trailer part to see you as the

1059
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,630
person you are today you're far from

1060
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,700
perfect Mike but I think you're so much

1061
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,280
better than where you came from

1062
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,410
it's not just how far how close you are

1063
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,240
to the finish line

1064
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,220
it's how far you had to travel some

1065
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,420
people started on the start line

1066
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,060
with you and I we started out the

1067
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,300
fucking parking lot yeah you know I mean

1068
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,369
I'm a liberal yeah I mean people give me

1069
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:47,960
crap for that all the time you know I

1070
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,619
just couldn't imagine like I don't want

1071
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,000
to do some sort of like political

1072
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,380
division but I guess what I'm gonna say

1073
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,200
I think you and I have a very common

1074
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,070
philosophy we have a live and let live

1075
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,630
philosophy and I don't care what your

1076
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,800
political stance is I don't care what

1077
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,510
your sexual choices I don't care right

1078
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,700
who who or what you want to be right as

1079
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,900
long as you're not harming somebody else

1080
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,740
and I don't think you're harming

1081
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,690
somebody else by voting one way or the

1082
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,500
other I don't think you're harming

1083
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,240
somebody else by choosing a certain

1084
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,190
sexuality or choosing a certain gender I

1085
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,720
don't think you're harming anybody even

1086
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,090
yourself then I just live and let live

1087
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,320
just do whatever you want to do and

1088
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,550
that's something you I have always had

1089
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,460
in common but here's I will say some

1129
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,820
also got a family to take care of

1130
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,130
I've got grand I don't bring kids

1131
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,920
grandpa my nephews I take care of my

1132
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,900
entire family rely on me and I take care

1133
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,060
of them and sometimes to do that I got a

1134
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,660
quick baby and like if that's something

1135
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,730
that you can't support I understand you

1136
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,770
know like I've always said thank you for

1137
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,110
the support to this point and if you're

1138
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,730
popping off at this point then I'm gonna

1139
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,860
miss you and I'm sorry to see you go but

1140
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,940
this is something that I've got to

1141
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,070
continue doing when it comes to the

1142
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,070
racism like a lot of that stuff was

1143
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,230
stupid skits you shouldn't do that kind

1144
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,330
of stuff in the Internet man but at the

1145
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,890
time to the early days we never knew

1146
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,630
what our YouTube was gonna get to so we

1147
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,250
were just throwing caution to the wind

1148
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,050
and just doing everything crazy it was

1149
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,720
like Andy Kaufman right like do whatever

1150
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,870
you have to do and be damned who doesn't

1151
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,820
like and who it offends and we learned

1152
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,040
from doing that that you can't do that

1153
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,590
you can't live your life that way it's

1154
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,370
not healthy for you it's not healthy for

1155
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,480
the people watching it you're gonna

1156
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,430
offend people unrightfully and I learned

1157
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,830
that about midway into our YouTube and I

1158
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,820
stopped doing it right but his grandkids

1159
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,710
the abuse allegations are the most

1160
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,430
hurtful and harmful because I saw a man

1161
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,080
that you guys didn't see I saw the man

1162
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,790
that went through all those school

1163
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,850
functions the man who cried when he

1164
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,430
watched my nephew JC go to Willow gray

1165
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,100
because he want to change his life the

1166
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,900
man who told me on his deathbed no

1167
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,610
matter what make sure those kids don't

1168
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:21,140
go without the man who loved his young

1169
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,550
uns so much that he wanted them to come

1170
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,250
to his funeral as much as I wanted to

1171
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,900
make that a private affair as much as I

1172
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,430
wanted that to just be family and

1173
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,830
friends he wanted you guys there and

1174
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,210
that's the person that I saw her when up

1175
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,020
dad was my hero

1176
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,180
and I miss him and I wish I wouldn't

1177
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,230
have to use his name for videos but

1178
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,370
sometimes that's just how it happens

1179
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:51,270
sometimes that's just my life and I'm

1180
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,770
sorry if that offends you guys too

1181
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,990
I mean I personally know you're just

1182
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,270
working through it man and I've it's

1183
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,680
still fresh I know

1184
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,020
I mean I'm my mom's my dad since 2009

1185
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,880
and I still miss her and people wonder

1186
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,650
why the boogie you hated her like I

1187
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,410
hated her about loved her right I mean

1188
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,690
she was I saw her every Christmas I saw

1189
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,560
her every birthday I saw her every

1190
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,470
chance I had you know it's tough this is

1191
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,730
something that I played myself before

1192
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,610
bed and no one's ever heard this before

1193
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:24,020
it was my last voicemail from dead

1194
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,120
safety just one embraer you use

1195
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:40,110
according the linear formula just cool

1196
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,870
you call that it was my anniversary

1197
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,970
we called me

1198
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:57,220
oh god where am I don't nothing I missed

1199
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:57,880
him

1200
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,579
I wish I did miss him so bad Jesus can

1201
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:11,510
we get cut and we just thought yeah

1202
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,290
I'm sorry I just might

1203
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,490
I can't hide it you have been an

1204
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,470
emotional wreck you know what I mean and

1205
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:23,360
I'm better now than I was than n so you

1206
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,670
can imagine how bad it was like I was

1207
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,500
crying myself to sleep every night how

1208
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,030
many people don't know this boat we were

1209
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,980
on the phone a couple of times a month

1210
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,320
after that pass and we talked about this

1211
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,640
there were times where I don't know if I

1212
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,080
would have made it a ninety-two team yet

1213
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,010
and get that phone call

1214
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,570
exactly the same thing I mean you were

1215
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,740
helping me through my divorce at the

1216
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,760
same time and so it was it's it's the

1217
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,780
most painful thing I've ever gone

1218
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,760
through it's the most traumatic thing I

1219
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,010
know I'm still learning life without him

1220
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:54,290
and it's so hard and I see these people

1221
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,900
accused in the lake all these abuse

1222
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,240
allegations and I and I just remember

1223
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,890
all the stuff that he did and all the

1224
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,960
love that he had for those grandkids and

1225
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,400
that's what hurts the most to see them

1226
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,710
accuse him of that because this is a man

1227
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,020
and this has never been said before I

1228
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,160
don't believe mom had a big freakout

1229
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,760
back in January of like 2011 and she

1230
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,550
like carved stuff into my dad's car like

1231
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,480
because she was accusing him of cheating

1232
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,580
and he wasn't but like she just wanted

1233
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,700
to leave she wanted out and they made up

1234
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,980
and DSS came to the house and they said

1235
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,520
listen the kids got to come out of the

1236
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,290
house because of her dad divorced there

1237
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,670
was that one that was all about dad

1238
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,680
divorced her because he was going to

1239
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,630
choose them over her because she was

1240
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,830
clearly ready to go

1241
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,470
it was clearly over and I'm not gonna

1242
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,350
lose my grandkids over it

1243
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,940
and he fought for those grandkids till

1244
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,030
the day he died he what Jacob was doing

1245
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,590
bad in school he would go to the school

1246
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,410
he would talk to him and he was they

1247
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,000
loved him at that school you know what I

1248
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,470
mean if he was so abusive they would

1249
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,940
have taken those kids a long time ago

1250
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,830
they would have taken them for me if

1251
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,810
those other accusations were true right

1252
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,810
like none of that's true and they don't

1253
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,250
realize you're hurting real people when

1254
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,300
you do that you're not just hurting me

1255
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,250
you're hurting the kids already exactly

1256
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,600
like they got to be taken out of class

1257
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,560
sometimes to talk

1258
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,250
DSS over made-up allegations and that's

1259
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:24,620
not fair it's that's that's abuse was so

1260
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,390
one last question I have for you and

1261
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,240
this I think is really important when it

1262
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,390
comes to the allegations of stuff that

1263
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,040
are loaded against you sometimes it's

1264
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,890
baseless sometimes it's constructive

1265
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,150
criticism and this is something I

1266
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,040
struggle with all the time it's so hard

1267
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,670
to tell

1268
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,740
especially when you're so defensive I'm

1269
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,420
so defensive and I know I think you are

1270
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,460
too which is the constructive criticism

1271
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,820
and which is the just people trying to

1272
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,300
get at you right but when you hear

1273
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,370
constructive criticism are you ready to

1274
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,140
change in those ways are you ready to

1275
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,450
grow are you ready to say that maybe

1276
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,100
this is the equivalent of me changing

1277
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,660
the hanging the flag upside down maybe

1278
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,610
this is the equivalent of me spraying on

1279
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,400
the wall you know anti-christian stuff

1280
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,920
are you willing to listen and to grow

1281
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,780
and to change to the right people maybe

1282
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,460
not your audience right now because I

1283
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,140
know they're filled with twenty percent

1284
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,880
of your audience he watches I know that

1285
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,800
and most of the people who love you they

1286
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,890
never say anything right yeah um but

1287
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,050
when it comes to my constructive

1288
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,360
criticism or urbanites jessee's or

1289
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,190
already the rest of the day are you

1290
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,420
willing to grow you're willing to change

1291
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,860
around you're going to learn when it

1292
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,770
comes from people that I know love me

1293
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,940
absolutely yours on Twitter you come

1294
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,260
across this like just shutting everybody

1295
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,120
down instantly but see the reason I do

1296
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,680
that is I'll go to their profile and

1297
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,450
I'll see they are not doing constructive

1298
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,670
criticism the claim they are right but

1299
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,230
you can just go down their timeline and

1300
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,120
you can tell who is and isn't causing

1301
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,970
concern like if I sometimes I have gone

1302
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,740
at people that didn't deserve it gone

1303
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,910
back over the roof right and then

1304
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,830
apologized right Ivan literally messes

1305
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,600
it literally when if somebody hits me on

1306
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,940
Twitter now I will look at their replies

1307
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,650
to people exactly if it's just all

1308
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,600
hateful replies like oh I don't need to

1309
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,680
worry about this guy because they don't

1310
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,540
really mean it but like if I go to

1311
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,850
somebody's profile and it's an lbgtq

1312
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:11,120
community member who's is very open and

1313
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,440
honest it actually just wants to engage

1314
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,390
positively and teach me what I'm doing

1315
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,740
wrong obviously that's the person I'm

1316
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,030
gonna talk to and when you see me

1317
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,010
apologize I'm not apologizing

1318
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,230
because someone whose toxic has talked

1319
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,550
me I apologize

1320
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,079
may be someone who's not talks

1321
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,299
has taught me how to grow a person right

1322
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:27,829
you're willing to grow your woman I'm

1323
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:29,239
not willing to grow but one thing I

1324
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,369
won't do is something that I have

1325
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,430
accused you of this sure is eventually

1326
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,950
when you give in so many times they're

1327
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,630
gonna make you give in to everything and

1328
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,579
they try and not everything that I do is

1329
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:42,289
worth giving in to a hotel

1330
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,479
I mean exactly me too I'm young I give

1331
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,849
in to a lot Melissa that's a good person

1332
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:48,829
you know what I mean like I give to

1333
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:51,249
charities I take care of my family I

1334
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:55,579
love I'm not this inhuman monster that

1335
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:56,869
they try to make me out to be and if I

1336
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:59,119
do something stupid I'm not going to

1337
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,579
like like if it's worth apologizing for

1338
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,170
I'm going to like when we parked in the

1339
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,640
handicapped space which we didn't even

1340
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,950
park there we did this picture where I

1341
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,269
said we're savages

1342
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:10,309
I apologize for that because I was wrong

1343
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:12,200
but the other stuff I'm not gonna

1344
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,849
apologize for because they're wrong and

1345
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:15,469
they're just they're trying to pull

1346
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:17,329
skeleton this is a prime example of you

1347
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,249
learning and growing right like even I

1348
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,209
don't want to make that kind of joke

1349
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,589
anymore right I don't operation

1350
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:22,940
accommodator right and I love that about

1351
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,289
you it was stupid

1352
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:25,880
yeah here's something the reason I feel

1353
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,140
a kinship with you and the reason I feel

1354
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,430
a kinship with your dad's not just you

1355
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,839
know the abusive pass of how we share

1356
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,759
that and how we will dole all that

1357
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,829
misery but we're growing up poor but

1358
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:36,019
it'sit's the fact that I genuinely think

1359
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:38,209
that you are a good person who does bad

1360
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,069
things sometimes I know that your dad

1361
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:43,269
was a good person son of a bitch

1362
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:50,400
probably a fan got a polio

1363
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,869
literally fans calling in the middle of

1364
00:49:52,869 --> 00:50:07,830
an interview hello yes it is oh one

1365
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:19,400
know who is this

1366
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,959
no yeah we do uh we do YouTube and so

1367
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:26,640
these are fans that are trying to get

1368
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,170
through to the room I was hoping that I

1369
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,579
could put some do not disturb or

1370
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,690
something

1371
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,920
thank you so much they do it every time

1372
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,449
man when I was staying in Las Vegas

1373
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:42,299
somebody actually tricked me and this is

1374
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:43,949
gonna be some moment that they're gonna

1375
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:47,099
enjoy hearing I did a video our brain

1376
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,599
raised my hand through a swimming pool

1377
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,829
in Vegas and somebody calls me buddy as

1378
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:55,109
the Environmental Protection Agency and

1379
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:58,259
they told me that because I touched it

1380
00:50:58,259 --> 00:50:59,759
they had to drain the pool because it

1381
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:02,069
was freshly like chemicals right and I

1382
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:03,539
was going to have to pay that and they

1383
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:05,009
really really mad at me and I believed

1384
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:05,400
it

1385
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,069
that's it wasn't real as they say it

1386
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:10,440
wasn't real this is what they do that

1387
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,049

1388
