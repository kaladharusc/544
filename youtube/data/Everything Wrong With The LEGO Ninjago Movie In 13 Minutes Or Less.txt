1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,679
old-timey ninja movie style logos are

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,630
hopefully not racist kid wanders into a

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,370
magical shop cliche the giant

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,780
taxidermied bird and this hate mask

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,310
would be enough to send any non movie

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,990
child running immediately this kid is a

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,539

Jesus kid he just answered your goddamn

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,620
question listening might actually help

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,120
in your pursuit of friends sleight of

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
hand this good just after saying

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,629
everything here is real also a nice gift

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,340
assuming the kid wants his figure to be

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,750
a ninja what if he was hoping for a

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,460
fireman or a banker or an instructions

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,780
following construction worker turned

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,610
master builder named Emmett this is his

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,120
teacher

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
how does Jackie Chan have Lloyds teacher

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
he didn't even have Lloyd until the kid

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,100
brought him in a few minutes ago also

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,260
the scene contains no mug wine have you

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,860
ever heard a legend behind a legend of a

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,320
ninja whore no subtitles for this movie

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,180
the fucking subtitles have a registered

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,310
trademark icon after the word Ninjago I

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,810
took a screenshot and everything also

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,310
legend behind the legend

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,689
we haven't even heard the first legend

35
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,159
did we have to do research before we

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,990
watch this this is worse than a Marvel

37
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,400
movie expecting us to have watched half

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,659
a season of agents of shield before

39
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,040
seeing Captain America Winter Soldier

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,500
who is this kid where did you come from

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,630
does he have parents siblings I mean if

42
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,829
you feel the need to give me a human

43
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,390
live action opening to justify our

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,920
animated lego movie at least give me

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,659
something this is literally just kid

46
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,009
wanders into a store two minutes later

47
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,049
creepy guys telling a story also this is

48
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,700
the princess Brian at the pagemaster the

49
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,189
lego movie and somehow there's still 98

50
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,020
minutes to go be news team watching

51
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,659
Garmadon is volcanic lair 24 hours a day

52
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,220
this is

53
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,660
I just had a seizure and I'm not even

54
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,670
epileptic Jesus I need a young priest

55
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,020
and an old priest hey don't you dare

56
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,480
come out at least until our secret ninja

57
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,030
force that's it if they're filmed and in

58
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,470
downtown streets and on the fucking

59
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,880
Morning News do we really need to waste

60
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,180
syllables on the word secret how does

61
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,680
the news have footage from inside the

62
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,570
cockpit of the ninja robot and why is a

63
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,250
ninja piloting a robot instead of being

64
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,110
a ninja exactly how Power Rangers is

65
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,840
this thing anyway ninja and these

66
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,850
freeze-frame / animated character naming

67
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,140
screens are getting really fucking old

68
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,910
not all movies are Deadpool or even

69
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,210
Suicide Squad just stop water ninja sure

70
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,840
why not

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,250
let's throw an avatar the last airbender

72
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,410
into the ripoffs - at this point only

73
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,060
five minutes in mind you the flavors are

74
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,350
already so congealed that new

75
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,340
ingredients won't really make a

76
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,440
noticeable impact you fellas need to

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,230
inform yourselves where we're at

78
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,790
culturally going to go out on a limb and

79
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,320
say this movie will not be anywhere

80
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,700
close to the definition of culturally

81
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,290
sensitive so this seems like the pot

82
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,030
calling the kettle a lot of culturally

83
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,709
insensitive things the shop has at least

84
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,540
five vertically mounted TVs in its

85
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,160
display window this unpopular because

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,660
your dad's a villain why not just

87
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
homeschooling or not school alone I mean

88
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,070
how rewarding can this kid's life in

89
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,750
public school be even the girl with

90
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,100
dental headgear is mocking this dude

91
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,780
that's not real life and I say that as

92
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,310
someone who wore dental headgear like

93
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,320
this to school this wyldstyle 2.0

94
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,670
character introduction takes about five

95
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,260
seconds too long and it only takes about

96
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,760
eight seconds in total she rides a

97
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,350
motorcycle she's crazy got it

98
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,650
karma dork and the dork squad said the

99
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,420
male cheerleader wearing pink pom-poms

100
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:26,840
on his hands but whatever that year the

101
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,070
bully did in the hallway is playing on

102
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,530
the radio just FYI I know I know that's

103
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,330
the joke but come on man movie shows me

104
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,160
three puke then say the villains name

105
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,110
shots in succession and well I have

106
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,760
rules about that movie just earned five

107
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,730
sins at once

108
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,110
[Music]

109
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,600
okay this is pretty funny but also like

110
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,190
again to beat a dead horse

111
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,480
why does Lloyd even keep coming to this

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,340
school how was he this hated and taunted

113
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,720
but not one person who's beat him up yet

114
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,160
I wasn't remotely this hated but even I

115
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,170
got beat up in school so what happens if

116
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,550
they ever get assigned new lockers or

117
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,530
when they eventually graduate ninja T

118
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,350
shout out your callsign for the benefit

119
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,730
of the viewing audience alone as we all

120
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,200
clearly already know each others call

121
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,970
signs as long as we have these max

122
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,410
Lauren stop the ball

123
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,960
I smell foreshadowing and burning also

124
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,370
this hanger appears to be above ground

125
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,260
so why would they have to descend in the

126
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,400
lockers going in just go is that how

127
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,620
they got their name the Ninjago name if

128
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,210
so why did they pronounce it Ninjago

129
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,310
instead of Ninjago these ninjas seem to

130
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,780
be causing as much destruction if not

131
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,720
more than Garmadon screw hi Dana cool

132
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,450
you guys take downtown pretty good

133
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,340
chance no one else can hear loin but if

134
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,540
you're trying to keep your identity as a

135
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,160
secret why wouldn't why just use the

136
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,330
ninja code names when he's barking

137
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,850
orders at them okay you got a laugh out

138
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:50,129
of me movie enjoy your sin reduction

139
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,810
repetition equals live sex Wilhelm just

140
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,300
one day to retire guy has one day till

141
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,979
retirement mentions it and dies cliche

142
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,710
you know it's funny I know how to do all

143
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,650
those things do you yeah oh good to know

144
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,150
Lloyd's lack of a father comments and

145
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,680
Garmadon coming close to admitting to it

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,849
but always referring to something else

147
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,590
happens a lot and tires out very quickly

148
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,150
so I'm just gonna go ahead and tack on

149
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,770
20 cents I'm not certain we did that I

150
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,090
was being sarcastic

151
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,099
Garmadon sure seems like Lorde business

152
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,330
painted all black doesn't it

153
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,490
it's okay Lloyd nobody's parents are

154
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,629
perfect tell Beth the Kim Kardashian

155
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,289
will never truly defeat Garmadon until

156
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,810
you see things from a different point of

157
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,879
view gee thanks Oracle Yoda sensei

158
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,740
Dustin Hoffman rap Morpheus obi-wan and

159
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,139
Gandalf the cosines are not just cool

160
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,750
names they are the elemental powers you

161
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,330
were all born with like the element of

162
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,520
green also doesn't it seem like you

163
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,810
should've told us a long time ago as

164
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,979
opposed to some kind of new point of

165
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:51,729
view did you call his uncle because he

166
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,229
was just with him for some reason while

167
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,610
worrying about her son this woman has

168
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,139
poured two bowls of cereal and stacked

169
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,550
them on top of each other I'm even

170
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,960
overlooking the second clear shot of

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,310
cornflakes in this movie because the

172
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,289
stacked bowls is way weirder this didn't

173
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,789
work the last time when Garmadon wasn't

174
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,319
in this giant Voltron thing so why the

175
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,490
hell does Lloyd think it'll work this

176
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,409
time he throws the pesky green ninja and

177
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,969
its dragon into the bay instead of you

178
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,589
know ripping off heads and that would

179
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,330
prevent a rematch Michael Strahan is

180
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,069
easily the creepiest Lego creation for

181
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,629
any of these movies looks like his scalp

182
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,069
was removed and reattached by Hannibal

183
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,949
Lecter Lego shark projectiles rip off

184
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,599
the seagulls from Finding Nemo how did

185
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,250
the Sharks get in the elevator did

186
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,539
Garmadon shoot some in there before

187
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,650
we're going around to the other side of

188
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,909
the building knowing the people in the

189
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,560
office would take this route seems

190
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,789
pretty over-the-top for some random

191
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,070
opposite of random people

192
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,199
[Music]

193
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,669
his mech controlled movements are way

194
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,379
too fast for how slow the actual mech is

195
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,610
moving are you crossing your fingers

196
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,979
that's physically impossible like how

197
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,150
could I be crossing my fingers I have

198
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,560
these things I'm Garmadon brings up a

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,979
good point

200
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,389
how would Louie even know what fingers

201
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,919
are that shouldn't even be in the Lego

202
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,020
lexicon also Garmadon would be excellent

203
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,650
at cinemasins

204
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,719
okay so the ultimate weapon being a

205
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,159
laser pointer that does nothing then

206
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,050
turning out to be just a lure for a cat

207
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,270
who is the real weapon hilarious once in

208
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,550
removed but also isn't as a Lego acted

209
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,839
out story being told to the kid by

210
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,470
Jackie Chan

211
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,060
this isn't the kids imagination like the

212
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,800
first lego movie where a real world cat

213
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,660
playing a role might make sense I'm just

214
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,430
saying if there were a real world cap on

215
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,900
this Lego set chasing a red laser

216
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,340
pointer he would definitely chase this

217
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,170
tiny parachuting guy to the laser

218
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,580
pointer joke was good but those aren't

219
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,350
the only things that cats chase Garmadon

220
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,790
seems like a pretty sweet target where

221
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,320
he is currently why wouldn't the ninjas

222
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,460
regroup jumping one of the flying

223
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,960
contraptions and blow his ass out of the

224
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,440
sky

225
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,180
I have always tried to get Lloyd to see

226
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,620
that he shouldn't be ashamed of who his

227
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,320
father is why his father is the worst

228
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,910
person alive in this universe why would

229
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,290
you spend years trying to tell Lloyd to

230
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,640
accept his father's identity you're a

231
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,190
terrible mother her reign of terror was

232
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,130
stretched on and on and to all of

233
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,460
Ninjago is her personal litter box

234
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,830
this cat is not going to on the Legos

235
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,750
and turning on the laser pointer should

236
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,580
not have awakened the cat like the cat

237
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,020
supposedly never jumps up here and

238
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,340
record unless there's a laser pointer

239
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,960
involved this movie is never candid

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,300
before one thing it can drive me out

241
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,169
throw away the ultimate ultimate weapon

242
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,090
god damn it not sure when I just saw but

243
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,320
I'm ready to kill the Malaysian Prime

244
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,090
Minister at my next Fashion Show Stu

245
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,010
days are you willing to give Lloyd a

246
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,169
second chance not saying Lloyd didn't

247
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,970
let emotions get to him and whatnot he's

248
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,470
not exactly to blame here the entire

249
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,000
city knows Garmadon is going to attack

250
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,530
frequently no one else has ever come up

251
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,150
with anything better so at least Lloyd's

252
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,800
can trying something okay yes he's

253
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,330
playing welcome to the jungle but still

254
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,190
fluting while traveling and when you

255
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,540
could really make use of a non-polluting

256
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,610
walking stick you are all terrible

257
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,190
ninjas I would take care of Garmadon on

258
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,780
that whole but are they terrible they've

259
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,849
warded Garmadon plans tons of times and

260
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,979
woo was on vacation during the first big

261
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,020
battle where your little ninja ninja

262
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,780
nerd where your little ninja nerds

263
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,979
nailed it now you're stealing Batman's

264
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,300
jokes from your own Lego franchise

265
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:50,050
movies stealthily gone from not as good

266
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,339
as the other two Lego movies to

267
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,110
genuinely boring enlightening QuickTime

268
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,550
I haven't written any sins for the last

269
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,500
three minutes a movie because it's just

270
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,300
bland it's just not fun or interesting

271
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,640
or notable it merely is all I can

272
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,260
remember is we really need a ninja

273
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,900
master and you are not a ninja master

274
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,910
Lloyd's friends are dicta Lloyd and

275
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,530
they're also really stupid I look like

276
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,790
I'm making out with two people don't I

277
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,530
yes one of whom is apparently blowing

278
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,270
you kids movie villain we should be

279
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,670
practicing silence right now this

280
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,390
probably

281
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,620
have happened in the writers room more

282
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,480
often as well this is my least favorite

283
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,500
place I've ever been

284
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,320
well you chose the path taking advice of

285
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,700
a supervillain over that of your friend

286
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,190
so deal against all common sense these

287
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,020
idiot ninja students bring a captured

288
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,880
incapacitated Garmadon with them because

289
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,710
they believe they need a ninja master in

290
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,850
order to complete the quest to the

291
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,590
ultimate ultimate weapon which they want

292
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,510
to use to stop Garmadon the guy they

293
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,860
just made their master and already have

294
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,870
captured do I have that right Jesus on a

295
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,440
cracker

296
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,320
what without our max then why the hell

297
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,790
did you run into the middle of a battle

298
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,550
with undead generals you know the real

299
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,840
problem with this movie versus the other

300
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
two big screen Lego movies is that it

301
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,170
tries so very fucking hard to be funny

302
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,940
and it's not sure the other two were

303
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,410
broad and at times very on the nose but

304
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,600
most of those jokes hit in this one

305
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,760
practically none of them do a 15 million

306
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,800
Kelvin magma will melt your skin before

307
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,510
you can even feel but hey that's

308
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,140
gruesome

309
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,550
especially so for the eight-year-olds in

310
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,710
the audience jesus also Kelvin scale

311
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,510
wait what why did they let the other

312
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,070
ninjas live at the very least they could

313
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,480
have taken them as prisoner right we

314
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,460
just gotta figure out how to be real

315
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,050
ninja sounds easy

316
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,360
wait hey don't you have like 700

317
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,460
gigabytes of martial arts movies on your

318
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,880
harddrive

319
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm not even sure how this would help

320
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,090
them but still convenient thought

321
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,710
process is so inconvenient

322
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,630
I guess this montage of kung-fu movies

323
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,280
is supposed to be funny but the idea is

324
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,870
literally that the robot Ninja has these

325
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,820
movies in his memory and they use them

326
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,740
to learn ninja but is he just showing

327
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,790
them short clips and announcing the

328
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,320
titles like we see or are they watching

329
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,970
the entire films or are they getting it

330
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,860
through osmosis or something like neo in

331
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,210
the matrix I realized this movie is

332
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,620
silly on purpose but it's honestly just

333
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,070
too damn silly make it to the ultimate

334
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,990
ultimate weapon that's like why do you

335
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,580
still need the weapon me I'll throw his

336
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,290
either moved on or destroyed Ninjago by

337
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,880
now and you've got Garmadon trapped on

338
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,710
the precipice up a volcano just push his

339
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,240
ass ever so gently into the night and be

340
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,150
done with it

341
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,650
everyone knew he couldn't throw so

342
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,180
giving Lloyd this job makes zero sense

343
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,980
contention muttering please not Jim

344
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,100
Croce jinxed us whatever this must have

345
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,570
been real exciting for all the five year

346
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,640
old Jim Croce fans I'm gonna teach you

347
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,710
how to throw yep literally pausing in

348
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,970
the middle of a huge battle to go play

349
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,830
catch and father-son bond so they can

350
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,910
come back and throw bricks and be

351
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,590
helpful to the others not sure if this

352
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,060
was the point or not but this entry into

353
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,560
the franchise feels the most like you're

354
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,270
just watching some kid play a lego video

355
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,100
game I've no arm are you

356
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,810
disgusted with this you already did the

357
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,310
foot stuck to the head joke and clearly

358
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,139
understand how Legos work find the arm

359
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,430
plug it back in move on with your life

360
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,230
it's not even any blood but if I ever

361
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,519
see that goat again he and I are gonna

362
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,290
have words and you could bet some of

363
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,339
those words are gonna have four letters

364
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,529
substitute movie four goat and you sum

365
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,620
up my feelings right now it was love at

366
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,389
first don't say fight don't say fight

367
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:51,550
fight god damn it people would never see

368
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,399
me as a hero but it doesn't have to be

369
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,680
this way actually it doesn't Garmadon is

370
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,540
right he's tried to destroy Ninjago how

371
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,319
many times now I'd say more like the

372
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,569
Washington Generals door only locks from

373
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,430
the outside the helicopter that stopped

374
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,019
working in crash now miraculously works

375
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,740
again you're alive he was alive when you

376
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,430
last saw him

377
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,990
Shuri was floating down a river but no

378
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,579
reason to assume that definitely equals

379
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,970
death some powers a once you cannot see

380
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,149
that those are the most important powers

381
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,910
of all but Lloyd still has no powers so

382
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,319
the other ninjas who now have powers

383
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,699
could just leave him behind as they

384
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,589
should and do their own thing all Lloyd

385
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,420
managed to do was save Garmadon everyone

386
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,200
wanted dead and rightfully so

387
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,529
[Music]

388
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,970
nothing says ninjas like a horrible pop

389
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,730
song from the fool

390
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:53,579
I don't know you man I'm not here for

391
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,800
you let's not do this time to Duck and

392
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,740
Cover the bombs coming down a radiation

393
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,709
shower will blow throughout your town

394
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:27,329
hold on we got it now well that's not

395
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,690
even a real finish no that's a goldfish

396
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,410
cracker just one day to retire to office

397
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,980
I have come here to chew bubblegum and

398
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,779
kick ass

399
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,269
it looks like my left arm except it's

400
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,029
the right one oh just a shoe seen it

401
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,800
anyway it's like this one

402
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,000
you know Upstate's this
