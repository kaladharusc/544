[Music]

2
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,020
me no oh shit

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,170
wear something so apparently the movie

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,359
has affected Joe so I'm gonna kick this

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,540
off welcome guys and uh they were good

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,000
we just relish this like it's it's not

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,140
often that we actually get to talk

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,329
without that is true welcome we just got

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,690
back from seeing a quiet place by John

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,879
Quincy

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,829
Jim from the office Jim from the office

12
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:58,620
I was

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,000
well it's his first it's a sorcerer

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,350
movies it directed I think he actually a

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,790
pretty good job

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,440
this was someone movie that we actually

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,979
saw uh previews for a couple months ago

18
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:11,880
and I actually thought it looked really

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,050
really good the first time the preview

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,400
came out we were both really excited

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,030
about it it looked like a really good

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,970
horror film and then two months back or

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,170
month back they released a second

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,729
trailer where there was they showed the

25
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,930
monsters and I was worried he was gonna

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,250
fall into the same problems that a lot

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,660
of like new directors and the horror

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,369
genre do where they show you the bad guy

29
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,380
and you just don't care and it's like

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,940
alright whatever you know it's just like

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,040
some dude in a big rubber suit or some

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,770
bad TGFs and this this kind of wasn't

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,060
the case actually kind of I kind of

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,040
liked this movie it was not what I was

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
expecting

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,100
definitely not was expecting because it

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,869
was sold as you know the the the

38
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,550
commercials were horrible it's like it's

39
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,770
one of the best war movies our time it's

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,190
not you never believed yeah but I mean

41
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,420
this was I don't even think I would call

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,399
this a horror movie no I gave a scene

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,050
said more like a thriller or something

44
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,940
yeah it's like a thrilling suspenseful

45
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,830
monster movie and I in that if you

46
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,140
classified there it did very well this

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,729
is a horrible horror movie so if you're

48
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,679
expecting to be scared I didn't get that

49
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,149
feeling I one of the reason I love

50
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,259
horror movie so much just I get this

51
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,650
feeling it's like this I'm if there was

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,970
a pillow I'd be almost like hiding

53
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,260
behind it I'm looking at the screen I

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,849
don't know what's gonna happen and there

55
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,500
was none of that at all this entire time

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,260
not not for me there was a couple times

57
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,930
where he kind of got me with like

58
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,670
unintentional jump scares they played a

59
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,160
lot with the volume where there's

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,620
everything's very quiet then all of a

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,700
sudden that you know there's there's a

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,860
lot of sounds that come through or you

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,970
know hand that reaches out and grabs

64
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,830
something and so there were some parts

65
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,020
where I mean I guess you could say this

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,880
is scary but I didn't feel that way

67
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,470
yeah I would classify more as a thriller

68
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,230
and I agree with your point for me a

69
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,660
horror would after I finished watching a

70
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,849
horror movie I would be scared to go

71
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,099
turn off lights yeah go down a dark hole

72
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,650
this no I didn't get that sense of

73
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,550
urgency or whatnot but I was in suspense

74
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,650
and I was like I guess who knows it I

75
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,970
had heard it sounds like what are you

76
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,370
doing it really got me involved in

77
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,989
smooth yeah you get it you kind of get

78
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:07,700
invested

79
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,349
especially because they do they they go

80
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,050
to such a high degree to make sure that

81
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,640
there and they I mean an insane amount

82
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,830
to the point where I'm usually the one

83
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,060
that like nitpicks like all that doesn't

84
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,650
make any sense like they go they go to a

85
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,510
crazy level where there's sand

86
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,890
everywhere they walk they're painting

87
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,750
the boards that are you know creaky or

88
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,870
not creaky versus creaky and you know

89
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,950
they were actually really smart about

90
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,140
how he went and so you know hats off to

91
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,330
the person who wrote this with him they

92
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,530
did a really good job kind of fleshing

93
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,019
this world out you see just enough of it

94
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,540
in newspaper clippings that you don't

95
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,040
know what the monsters are cuz one thing

96
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,330
wrong I like don't like with some of

97
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,769
these movies where they tell you exactly

98
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,209
what the monster is and then I don't

99
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,010
care because it doesn't make any sense

100
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,049
and you don't get any of that and I

101
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,220
think that's something that I

102
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,010
appreciated this because it's it's some

103
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,680
things it up to you because I saw some

104
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,590
little articles I don't want to say like

105
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,260
right now I'm doing spoilers later but I

106
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,239
was still haven't read but I go I was

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,700
curious to find out where that came from

108
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,090
what how'd this happen yeah exactly

109
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,430
well I really liked the the performances

110
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,319
from pretty much everybody in this film

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
I think John Krasinski himself was

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,579
really good Emily Blunt was good for the

113
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,109
most part the cachaca the kid actors

114
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,940
were really good there were some times

115
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,709
where I don't think it's the poor acting

116
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,530
on the kids part yes the the young deaf

117
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,780
girl it's not that I she didn't do a

118
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,850
killer job I think that you're supposed

119
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,169
to kind of be frustrated with her the

120
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,360
whole film and I absolutely was so if

121
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,440
that was something that they were

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,970
directing her to do then then she did

123
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,330
she did very very well yeah there she

124
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,210
was like her team very angsty yeah yeah

125
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,190
and then she was she made some decisions

126
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,979
and yeah very very believable in that

127
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,039
sense so I think overall kind of it was

128
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,550
again it's a really great opener for for

129
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,320
John Krasinski I hope he continues to do

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,710
these types of films because we don't

131
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,510
get a lot of good monster movies and I

132
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,650
say this was like a pretty good monster

133
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,320
movie I mean it could have been a little

134
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,000
bit bigger like if he wants to go into

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,410
like bigger monsters I'd be totally up

136
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,490
for it

137
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,250
but yeah I think this is a you tell him

138
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,300
I like the mist I'll be pretty cool

139
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,500
right

140
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,730
it's a home run BAM mm-hmm it's a home

141
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,060
run

142
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,690
I do know that my baby boy baseball

143
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,580
baseball movie knocked out of the park

144
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,840
Sandlot

145
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,700
Sanna oh I did like saying lo so that's

146
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,560
a great finish

147
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,840
so he's pouring he's pouring pouring

148
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,480
that's what this is baseball home run

149
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,930
swing knocked the other Park blinds okay

150
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,150
it's gotta be son swing away swing away

151
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,680
all right so would you want to get into

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,970
the final verdict so we actually talk

153
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,530
this is a movie that I think you want to

154
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,750
talk about once we can kind of tell you

155
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,580
what what's going on will be more free

156
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,650
with how we felt about certain parts so

157
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,360
let's get to the final verdict where'd

158
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,140
you think I really liked the acting it

159
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,900
wasn't a lot of dialogue no oh yeah

160
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,940
you can tell the emotion and the pain

161
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,760
they were going through the kids were

162
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,400
terrified which is great I was a lot of

163
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,010
I was at the edge of my seats at certain

164
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,100
points some things were pretty

165
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,669
far-fetched a little bit it's a monster

166
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,960
movie I mean you have to forgive it a

167
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,440
little bit but I yes oh yeah a baby the

168
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,770
giving baby's so loud

169
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,940
spoilers everyone talk because there's

170
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,930
some there's some things I want to talk

171
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,729
about the spoiler section

172
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm just saying overall I really enjoy

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,349
this movie I'm gonna give this an 8 out

174
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,490
of 10 hey yeah I I like this movie I

175
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,930
think it's definitely above average I

176
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,300
don't know if I would lump it in at an

177
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,279
eight I mean it's hard because you I

178
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,409
want to try to classify a movie so it's

179
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,490
like you know it's a horror movie this

180
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,759
is like why it's very average as a

181
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,589
monster suspenseful film it's definitely

182
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,509
better than that I mean I could I could

183
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,740
maybe see it but I'm gonna give this a

184
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,249
seven

185
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:09,960
it comes from really strong performances

186
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,509
from from the everyone involved they did

187
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,189
really clever things with the sound to

188
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,399
try to build suspense but it didn't feel

189
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,229
artificial like it did in Dunkirk where

190
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,669
there's a girl like a clock ticking in

191
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,080
the background for no reason just trying

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,370
to drive up your suspense so didn't feel

193
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,199
forced him that way and so I'm gonna

194
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,300
give this a seven you are you ready to

195
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,589
okay I could talk now we got the

196
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,979
waterfall going so my final very the the

197
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,039
film was so much tension of the

198
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,729
performances were excellent the the

199
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,699
subplot with you know the little girl

200
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,089
being deaf and the monsters having to

201
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,439
chase people around with sound is

202
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,009
fascinating then everybody puts in some

203
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,449
really good purple I didn't know that he

204
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,399
had this kind of talent he's a director

205
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,610
he's Jim he's a soldier right yeah he'll

206
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,310
ride it so I'm happy that the the film

207
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,439
did well however I think it's going to

208
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,159
be if you can you have to suspend your

209
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,770
disbelief why the hell would you be try

210
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,930
to bring a child and in this world why

211
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,029
the hell you know when the monsters

212
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,949
obviously they get close you've seen it

213
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,289
in the trailers you know if they can

214
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,809
hear things okay all right so eight out

215
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:28,020
of ten if you can suspend your disbelief

216
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,080
if you can't it is a good enough film

217
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,870
that it's still a seven out of ten even

218
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,199
if you're like no no that's no bullshit

219
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,610
you know what I mean it's still that

220
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,889
good where where it's at a seven so I do

221
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,719
think it's it's worth the watch if

222
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,209
you're into these kinds of movies and

223
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:46,670

224
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,459
like a sci-fi thriller monster flick for

225
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,339

226

Oh welcome to the spoilers section so

242
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,980
the first thing I gotta say the first

243
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,360
thing yeah I mean you didn't talk very

244
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,680
much I imagine you're gonna get it all

245
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,089
hour yeah there was

246
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,820
why the fuck would you have a baby in

247
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,149
this world why would you get pregnant

248
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,410
obviously at the beginning of the film

249
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,959
they lose their child you've seen the

250
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,100
trailer what he's doing the little

251
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,160
shuttle well he's not my bug is dead he

252
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,690
puts the batteries back my dough was

253
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,069
real or bitching about their before we

254
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,269
saw this feeling we're like why would

255
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,399
you let him have a thing like that well

256
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,839
it turns out the father did take it away

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,459
from her said no sue loud

258
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,670
pull the batteries out but then you know

259
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,009
the sister gives it back to him and she

260
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,569
walks off and he grabs the batteries and

261
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,420
he puts it on so it's the kids fault

262
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,930
he's dumb but whatever he died and but

263
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,910
so you're you're a couple and you're

264
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,380
trying to protect these children and you

265
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,779
see how seriously intense they are about

266
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,699
protecting their children and they lose

267
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,800
one and now they want to have sex well

268
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,149
they want to have sex and then it's like

269
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:39,980
when we were later after they had sex

270
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,510
away Jim got too excited and when he got

271
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,290
too excited yeah but why would you be

272
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,420
having sex after you're this node

273
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,889
lapping man fine antibiotics but I

274
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,709
design whatever so exactly and so they

275
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,300
wanted trying to bring a child in this

276
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,250
world what babies do when they come out

277
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,610
of a Wyatt baby yeah that was super

278
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,500
quiet baby so you have to suspend your

279
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,240
disbelief there's a moment where she got

280
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,980
the baby and the monsters like literally

281
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,740
right there the babies like even though

282
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,290
the baby can hear the monster going she

283
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,149
was in labor for like seven minutes yeah

284
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,430
maybe seven minutes like she her water

285
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,939
breaks

286
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,439
she walks upstairs and then she's like

287
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,240
hiding for a little bit and then let's

288
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,040
say maybe leave her 30 minutes and then

289
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,870
all of a sudden like she's in the

290
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,610
bathtub and she's given birth and like

291
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,620
she's she's like here I got I've got you

292
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,259
this baby here you go that is the

293
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,649
fastest labor and and who who else in

294
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,339
here thinks is incredibly stupid that

295
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,560
this thing that this film is all about

296
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,980
these monsters are detected by sound

297
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,600
like a detected by sound it's all about

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,740
sound even the newspapers like it's

299
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,250
sound and not a single fucking scientist

300
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,110
or military dude or anybody thought

301
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,270
let's use sound as a weapon to drive

302
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,640
them away not a single person in this

303
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,220
world which is a mask you so dumb as

304
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,180
hell if you the premises dumbest but

305
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,830
once you suspend your disbelief you're

306
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,960
like oh man this is a really great film

307
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,340
but it's stupid as I had a hard time

308
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,990
when they went to the waterfall he takes

309
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,580
his son out fishing to show them how to

310
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,600
like be a man and they're at the

311
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,210
waterfall this they're like bad set like

312
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,160
what big sound covers up little sound so

313
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,930
we can talk here and he in there like

314
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,280
shouting and they're having a great time

315
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,200
it's a fun idea it's a fun idea but they

316
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,550
just show you right then and there that

317
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,080
they get then if you play really loud

318
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,490
sounds I can't hear you he's got

319
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,900
speakers and everything everywhere why

320
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,790
not just like blast music the entire

321
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,260
time oh and they won't be able to they

322
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,060
don't believe you yeah well I think if

323
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,130
there's music created that that was

324
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,690
taken care of the film when the TV comes

325
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,030
on the when music is created the thing

326
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,100
will attack it and go out now if it's a

327
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,960
river I think the things understand that

328
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,490
they're swiping that water eventually

329
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,660
and then I'm fucking I'm leaving because

330
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,730
these things are blind yeah yeah so they

331
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,310
don't they don't see it okay and also

332
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,380
raise your hand again if you were

333
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,510
waiting for the monster to step on the

334
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,700
fucking nail yeah I should there's twice

335
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,880
Danny was the twice he comes down the

336
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,680
stairs and I was like come on that

337
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,200
wasn't looking male because in the film

338
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,960
like she catches some sack on on this

339
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,150
now and it rips it up and she steps on

340
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,480
it

341
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,460
and then she goes into labor she's got

342
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,950
this going on in this going on and the

343
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,050
monster comes down the stairs like two

344
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,450
or three times and never steps on a nail

345
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,800
I know it probably would have been

346
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,030
completely inappropriate would have

347
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,380
turned it into a comedy for half a

348
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,880
second but I think they're probably like

349
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,830
five seconds was kind of comedic right

350
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,720
there was no reason to have that little

351
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,310
thing where she she cocks the shotgun

352
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,680
and they go there one I liked it I liked

353
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,350
it that's those little wings like we've

354
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,930
we've given you a good time every habit

355
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,570
week yeah and I was like alright I I

356
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,980
didn't have a good time because at the

357
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,870
end you know so they think what's the

358
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,870
main Joe what is the main

359
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,550
how do you defeat the aliens or

360
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,589
creatures whatever they are which sound

361
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,860
frequency yeah but more speed back yeah

362
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,870
this frequency you're right maybe they

363
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,450
found a specific frequency truly yeah

364
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,670
yeah through the what do you call those

365
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,180
things

366
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,450
hearing aids and and then she was able

367
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,580
to amplify the hearing aid by putting it

368
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,980
up to her speakers and essentially blow

369
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,230
the head off of the alien I went bent

370
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,360
down got back up she finished it off

371
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,400
with a shotgun since some of its armor

372
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,520
shell had had come off during the sound

373
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,140
wave thing but that's what I was saying

374
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,600
earlier reminded me of signs I was

375
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,060
trying to say swing away and the water

376
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,490
so those aliens are weakness is water

377
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,070
it's so obvious that well that one

378
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,839
wasn't as obvious but it's a dumb

379
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,150
weakness this one was obvious from the

380
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,830
beginning that okay they're probably

381
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,750
weak to sound if nobody ever read a

382
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,410
venom comic this reminded me so much of

383
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,220
tremors tremors yes

384
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,860
no no man yeah it was sign one arms

385
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,620
evolution these are creatures now

386
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,870
they're like on ground and the attack

387
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:04,880
would sound like this is a new form of

388
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,600
tremor its tremors plus signs cuz

389
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,580
they're on a farm you have the corn

390
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,520
stalks and all that stuff but actually I

391
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,860
think he was probably done better better

392
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,740
than not I don't know tremors is is the

393
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,020
triassic so I can't compare it to that

394
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,680
but but signs I think I like it a little

395
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,020
bit better than signs I like signs a lot

396
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,110
more than other people do because is

397
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,120
really cool but I didn't really care

398
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,160
about those characters as much as I

399
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,839
cared about I think these these

400
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,970
characters maybe it's just cuz I really

401
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,430
like the office and it's Jim and he did

402
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,640
a better job building the world

403
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,910
yeah build the world up and then we're

404
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,380
only like three creatures but there were

405
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,550
probably more at the end did you see

406
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,959
more than three there's only three

407
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,130
there's three creatures in that specific

408
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,070
area yeah she she she shotgun one in the

409
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,980
head and it attracted the other two and

410
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,390
then that's when it does this little

411
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,700
action there she winks at the camera and

412
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,490
then she talks you don't wink it is she

413
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,779
we don't like deep down yeah but uh yeah

414
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,959
a really great effort from from Jim and

415
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,300
I think I heard he's gonna work on

416
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,339
something else of like sci-fi or some on

417
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,310
Mars maybe also kind of a horsing so

418
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,930
I'll be down for it

419
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,600
didn't know he had this tell me more

420
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,920
don't you break up no scrapped

421
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,899
Joe edges to his crap alright anyways so

422
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,690
anything else for spoilers let's see the

423
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,300
old man was a jerk yeah so what happened

424
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,740
there there was a lady's dead officer

425
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,589
his white guys it was she bleeding from

426
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,180
did he do something to her she did it

427
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,190
out of her guts were torn open yeah okay

428
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,260
so they previously got attacked they got

429
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,390
attacked and so his old man and his wife

430
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,339
had died and then so it really picked

431
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,930
somebody good who could do the whole

432
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,769
bitter beer face yeah because he was ah

433
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,209
he just wanted to suicide and kill

434
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:59,279
himself but it was like it was it was

435
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,170
almost like murder-suicide type thing he

436
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,029
knew exactly what he was he waited for

437
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,790
them he was he let them stand there took

438
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,370
no he wasn't in his right mind he I

439
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,630
don't think he was purposely trying to

440
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,290
kill them

441
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,299
he's just you just he's just I don't

442
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,250
give shit fucking and but that was

443
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,709
foreshadowing Jim's death which I hated

444
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,140
I wish he didn't have to die I thought

445
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,339
they were gonna do something with the

446
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,380
little gremlin on top of the car and she

447
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,480
was gonna activate her her ear thing

448
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,089
again and save save him at the last

449
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,360
minute but no time Oh Jim Jim took off

450
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,640
and they really pulled at your

451
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,650
heartstrings because after glorious

452
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,110
death you know it's she's the one that

453
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,140
gave the shuttle to her brother her

454
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,419
little brother who died and throughout

455
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,340
the whole film you think that maybe you

456
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,900
know they don't love her and

457
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,510
she feels isolated and very guilty and

458
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,700
he's never never really tells her since

459
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,350
then that he loves her and then he tells

460
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,820
her right then and there he's like you

461
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,110
know through the sign language that

462
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,880
they've come up with I think some of it

463
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,620
was real science some of it was probably

464
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,510
just you know stuff that they created

465
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,270
amongst their family but he says he

466
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,920
loves her and I was like oh that got

467
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,130
good that's the father man ain't gonna

468
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,200
answer I was like all right so when I

469
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,180
move we can get you like that you know

470
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,450
it's it's for me it's above average and

471
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,880
and it was good so yeah all right well

472
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,600
that's it for me well I joined the Peace

473
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,720
of quite well lasted oh yeah man the

474
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,640
only reason I do I talk look real on

475
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,920
purpose to get the reviews going quicker

476
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,560

other Joe and Alex show I saw that

484
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,600
article that said it could be creatures

485
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
from underground in the ocean so from

486
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,770
the Marianas Trench yeah it could be

487
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,940
Dean it could be all sorts of things

488
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,070
yeah I don't like when they go when you

489
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,860
try to explain the monsters or explain

490
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,660
the science and sci-fi it pisses me off

491
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,990
because they never do a good job very

492
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,010
rarely when they do a good job I'm yeah

493
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,110
I'm finally saying that the rule is if

494
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,880
you explain it you're gonna screw it up

495
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,100
and like less than 1% of the time do

496
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:50,640
they do each other okay

497
00:19:50,640 --> 00:20:21,000
