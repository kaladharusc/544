21
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,910

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,240
yeah

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,880
yeah

24
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,880
with the food here

25
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,530
yeah

26
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,620
anyway

27
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,750
they got against was talking to it explainer that he is the

28
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,620
Nana both dito champion

29
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,569
so we ordered a mojito for breakfast

30
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,810
he's also just a very good salesman

31
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,550
we got our award-winning

32
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,850
itÃµs a pretty good right

33
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,980
can you tell me

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,650
it's gonna come out of a can I wouldn't

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,650
difference

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:34,840
obligatory Cuban cigar shopping before and found a three hundred and forty

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,890
dollars per box

38
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,730
most expensive just get those are fine let's go

39
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,120
don't do that you've been here for 35 minutes

40
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,550
are you ready for the buses are gonna leave without us

41
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,930
yeah we know that she has been in there for one hour

42
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,049
I don't think she knows anyone that smokes cigars they have these old cars

43
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,680
here because of the trade embargo i think from nineteen fifty-nine

44
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,790
so they can import us cars after nineteen fifty-nine

45
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,900
so all the cars are from before nineteen fifty-nine but they have to keep these

46
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,269
things running to the last 60 years

47
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,829
and to do that they like completely Frankenstein them together so like it

48
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,139
looks like a funny old ha those taillights are from like a 1998 chevy

49
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,310
lumina

50
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,889
and they just appropriated them in the car culture probably captured my

51
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,889
imagination more so than anything else

52
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:38,329
yeah

53
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,419
we're back on the bus we're not headed to I think Ernest Hemingway's how

54
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,620
something like that

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,250
they're doing one more thing and then we leave

56
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,060
we've arrived it is

57
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,060
monsoon outside

58
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,969

59
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,659
kansas state on the bus because of course he did raining so hard

60
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:17,200
a place where there's cover ok they get a job and that's what that's what

61
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,930
we're going to the it says US Embassy residents now

62
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,620

63

this is the photoshoot situation at the u.s. ambassador's residence here we are

64
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,180
woefully underdressed and when I say we don't just mean innocently I we all are

65
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,180
a little underdressed to be here right now

he escaped Cuba an inflatable raft and inner tube and they rode from Cuba to

134
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,240
the United States of America where they were rescued and now he's a citizen here

135
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,190
and he brought his whole family here then we asked him what he did for a

136
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,620
living when he wasn't driving an uber car and what he does is he dresses up as

137
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:25,010
a clown and goes to a Children's Hospital and entertains kids that are
