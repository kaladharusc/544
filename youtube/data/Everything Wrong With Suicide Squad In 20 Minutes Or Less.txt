2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,740
easy comics boy for a black site they're

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,080
very specific about its location

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,440
[Music]

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,910
gee I wonder if any male character will

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,470
be able to own this female prisoner

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,029
character Harley steals the Juliette

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:21,590
Lewis from Natural Born Killers Garen

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,939
watching monitor was preoccupied with

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:28,250
Chinese food or Pizza cliche playing

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,540
sympathy for the devil during the

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,040
introduction of the main asshole of the

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,720
movie shows that this movie's asshole is

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,980
really the biggest asshole of the movie

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,480
bad news mr. Earp we've blown the entire

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,250
soundtrack budget inside four minutes of

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,720
the movie I've take the rest of what you

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,390
need out of my salary um four more songs

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,040
you heard me goddamn it the world

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,899
changed when Superman flew across the

21
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,760
sky not the main character starts

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,989
narrating four minutes into the picture

23
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,059
who opens a restaurant named after a

24
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,559
recurring bug infestation

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,059
just like naming your restaurant brood x

26
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,749
or even malaria carriers Superman values

27
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:00,949
this sounds like something a person

28
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:02,210
would say who hadn't seen Man of Steel

29
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,160
in Batman V Superman at least if our

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,780
values include not murdering thousands

31
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,520
of innocent civilians no no pictures

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,490
that Task Force X project of yours again

33
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,720
are you you guys didn't discuss this

34
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,190
before you set up this meeting at the

35
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,350
swanky restaurant Floyd Lawton aka

36
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,290
Deadshot so we saw Deadpool and decided

37
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,369
it wanted some of that sweet sweet

38
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,439
graphic credits love only in the process

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,030
it forgot to be funny so we're left with

40
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,619
stylized character introductions without

41
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,390
soul this will be introduced us to both

42
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,979
Deadshot and Harley Quinn in the first

43
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,420
minute but now we're getting second

44
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,770
introductions of them before we've even

45
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,390
gotten to the new characters yet seems

46
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,409
like this movie could have started with

47
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,820
Viola Davis and cut out all the creepy

48
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,590
garbles his Deadshot great with guns

49
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,119
because he naturally has amazing

50
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:39,590
hand-eye coordination or is because he

51
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,119
has this incredible scope that lines

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,829
everything up for I just gave an

53
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:44,360
anonymous chip to the right guy in

54
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,340
Gotham City an anonymous tip about what

55
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,869
if you followed his daughter to get him

56
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,460
why didn't you arrest him on your own

57
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,509
this just seems like a spot where you

58
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,740
wanted to introduce Batman into the

59
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,079
movie would you put him let's just say

60
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,460
put him in the hole and throw away the

61
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,439
hole well no he's in a regular ass

62
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,509
maximum security so that line makes it

63
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,159
sound like you paralax him first off the

64
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,570
murder of Robin is played like some

65
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,890
trifling thing that we get a blip of

66
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,840
text about second off this is the second

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,880
movie in the DCU this year to hint at a

68
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,350
Robin die story that would have been way

69
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,729
better than the two movies we actually

70
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,980
got she thought she was curing him but

71
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,800
she was falling in love but why because

72
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,630
he's so handsome or because she never

73
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,770
should have been certified to treat

74
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,210
Asylum patients in the first place due

75
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,490
to her own insanity and

76
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,720
even though she fell for him it's still

77
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,830
kind of hard to believe she got him a

78
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,720
machine gun I'm just gonna hurt you

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,050
really really badly badly Jesus it's

80
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,430
like playing cards with my sister's kids

81
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,350
Joker has his girlfriend strip dancing

82
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,150
in this club seemingly only to invite

83
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,250
fools to covet her too much or call her

84
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,959
a bad bitch so Joker can kill them at

85
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,640
the risk of sounding doubly sexist if

86
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,170
you're this jealous why let your lady

87
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,090
strip dance in the club yo Wow for a

88
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,010
major metropolitan city Gotham's River

89
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,140
has some clean s water also Joker flat

90
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,610
out abandoned his woman to save his own

91
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,170
skin that may be in character for him

92
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,489
but it's still a dick move worthy of

93
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,470
sinning also somehow Joker managed to

94
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,120
crash this car into the water find a way

95
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,709
out of the car and swim out of the view

96
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,959
of Batman before Batman jumped into the

97
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,580
water which if you recall was right

98
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,110
after they crashed I don't care how

99
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,580
crazy you are there is no way you can

100
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,080
somehow crash into the water then have

101
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,370
the wherewithal to pull out your knife

102
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,840
and fake unconsciousness for future

103
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,430
Batman killing after being threatened by

104
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,930
a tiny knife from a woman that's trapped

105
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,489
in the drowned car Batman decides the

106
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,690
best course of action is to treat her

107
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,130
like the producers of this movie treat

108
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,440
the audience then as the awesome Hugh

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,030
Jackman Mel Gibson Crocodile Dundee

110
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,489
digger Harkness the problem was doing a

111
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,690
comic book movie where the general

112
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,220
public only knows like one of your major

113
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,570
characters is that you end up wasting

114
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,980
the first third of your film doing

115
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,019
stupid introduction montages oh they

116
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,280
dragged Tom Hardy into this didn't they

117
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,470
no wait they hired you I Courtney into

118
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,030
this didn't they the flash shows up to

119
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,739
thwart this one burglar I'm sure there

120
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,269
was a better use of his time and I have

121
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,650
no idea how he knew this place was being

122
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,420
wrong but franchise got a franchisee Oh

123
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,190
movie contains approximately 32

124
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,140
gratuitous shots of steak eating this is

125
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,760
but one of them these constant close-ups

126
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,290
of eating are symptomatic of a fetish at

127
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,530
this point archaeologist dr. June June

128
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,709
moon June moon what a married Larry or

129
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,019
Pam's a more loosey-goosey she opened

130
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,790
something she shouldn't have something

131
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,590
evil that like parallax had been buried

132
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,180
slightly in the earth but not really all

133
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,680
that hidden so as to keep anyone from

134
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,450
ever finding it also is everyone with a

135
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,040
PhD in this movie unprofessional

136
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,450
they've got psychologists Harley Quinn

137
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,650
falling in love with the Joker of all

138
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,420
people and now we have dr. June moon

139
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,070
deciding to crack open a statue she

140
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,419
finds during some sort of solo

141
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,310
archaeological dig also this which

142
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,660
character is almost exactly the same

143
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,430
thing as apocalypse in the x-men movie

144
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,840
that came out this year some say the

145
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,880
witch has a secret buried heart whoever

146
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,130
finds it can control the winch which she

147
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,630
conveniently left behind after being

148
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,610
released from her statue for some reason

149
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,200
also this whole thing brings up more

150
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,150
questions than it answers what how did

151
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,360
you

152
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,069
first run into enchantress what was she

153
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,449
doing that alerted you to her presence

154
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,520
and if so how did she not already take

155
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,870
over the world with her powers yet how

156
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,949
did you know she came from this remote

157
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,900
jungle since dr. moon explored this cave

158
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,400
by herself every character in this movie

159
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,870
has a backstory let's see Ben on what

160
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,830
they were doing at the time they were

161
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,240
caught on this one we have to take it on

162
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,069
blind faith you want to put our national

163
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,580
security in the hands of witches

164
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,409
gangbangers and crocodiles this guy

165
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,900
would be excluded cinemasins rick flagg

166
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,030
almost 20 minutes and still introducing

167
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,280
characters i assigned him to watch dr.

168
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,650
moon and just as I hoped it got personal

169
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,840
I left everything to try it see and it

170
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,469
worked brilliantly

171
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:12,590
I had the witches Hart and dr. moon as

172
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,439
his now he'll follow my orders as Holy

173
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,750
Writ yeah so that's how you got him to

174
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,069
follow you orders but that doesn't mean

175
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,180
you can get all these other people to

176
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,349
follow them are you gonna find a few

177
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:22,789
more loved witches to control Deadshot

178
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,740
Diablo and Jai Courtney flying men and

179
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,990
monsters this is the only way to protect

180
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,400
our country I have heard your proposal

181
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,139
and it still sounds pretty stupid to me

182
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,729
let's get a whole bunch of untrustworthy

183
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,349
people some of which have minor powers

184
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,610
and others who simply have tremendous

185
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,349
human skill to try and fight something

186
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,599
like Colossus sure that'll work also

187
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,819
patently false you've already seen the

188
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,050
Batman bring in like half these

189
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,610
metahuman villains anyway right and

190
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,589
Superman still exists pretend dead as he

191
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,719
may be for now the only way the only way

192
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,729
in case you confused it for the Pentagon

193
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,909
Cleveland what if Superman had decided

194
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,639
to fly down rip off the roof of the

195
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,169
White House who would have stopped him a

196
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,699
bunch of psychotic supervillains turned

197
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,560
government heroes of course I want to

198
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,539
build a team of some very bad people who

199
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,370
I think and do some good nope

200
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,319
the end the next war will be fought with

201
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,270
these metahumans some of these villains

202
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,979
aren't metahumans though right am I

203
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,330
missing something got a guy on this team

204
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,400
who robbed banks two guys who are good

205
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,750
with weapons then there's a guy who can

206
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,310
set fires with his hands but that only

207
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,569
makes him marginally better than a

208
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,400
nine-year-old drew Barrymore you know we

209
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,719
can't control these people

210
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,400
Amanda will now demonstrate how she can

211
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,599
control this one person who was

212
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,069
possessed by a witch and translate that

213
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,050
into controlling everybody as we see dr.

214
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,759
moon turned into enchantress I will once

215
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,289
again ask how she was possessed by this

216
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,819
witch in the first place but was able to

217
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,080
control it enough to get back to the

218
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,060
States blab about it and be compromised

219
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,529
enchantress has the power to instantly

220
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,539
teleport to Iran and steal plans from a

221
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,370
vault but not to steal her heart back so

222
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,990
that Amanda can controller and sure

223
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,520
later they show the case has some sort

224
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,080
of sensor on it that seems to be where

225
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,399
the case is closed and otherwise

226
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,229
unguarded not that this should matter to

227
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,240
a witch you can transport

228
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,160
instantly to wherever she wants I moved

229
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,910
to authorize Manoir to establish task

230
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,740
force act maybe just the which well we

231
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,590
really need is the which I think olam a

232
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,050
go burrito Dania that's triple racist

233
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,910
movie repeats itself down to the stupid

234
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,560
close up up Diablo they showed just

235
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,940
before the wide shot of all his

236
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,560
destruction they say you never missed a

237
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,099
shot

238
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,900
prove it because whoever they are I

239
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,610
definitely don't trust them Deadshot is

240
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,259
definitely awesome at shooting and no

241
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,759
one should doubt he'd be great in a gun

242
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,259
battle but are you telling me there's

243
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,460
nobody on this earth who isn't a

244
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,080
criminal who can get at least close to

245
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,849
what he's doing here psychotic

246
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,699
antisocial freaks it makes no sense Rick

247
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,169
Flagg would also be excellent at cinema

248
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,580
since this movie is full of people who

249
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,199
should be working for us without you

250
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,759
minding her your lady friend stays here

251
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,319
strapped to a board and a drug-induced

252
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,360
coma this movie literally has no good

253
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,460
guys while I do believe Joker is OCD

254
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,810
enough to create this circle of knives

255
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,280
this is clearly a case of someone

256
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,569
thought of a cool looking shot so they

257
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:41,740
put it in the movie even if it didn't

258
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,180
make sense this is worse than V for

259
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,949
Vendetta Domino's in the previous scene

260
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,330
Joker's henchmen only knew that people

261
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,830
were being taken to a black site and

262
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,690
that's only new to finding the main guy

263
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,250
who guards they're in compromising it

264
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,620
Patriot Suites Hotel is totally holy God

265
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,849
lightning over the Washington Monument

266
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,949
is lightning hogging the bed I can hear

267
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,960
the director unset ok walk to the window

268
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,090
look out pensively now nosh on the

269
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,860
chicken leg look at your last meal and

270
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,860
cup perfect Rick Flagg is calling but

271
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,509
her phone is on silent for some reason

272
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,830
even though she's worried enough to keep

273
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,710
her gun nearby Amanda brings

274
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,210
Enchantress's brother statue with her

275
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,800
wherever she goes barely

276
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,110
[Music]

277
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,430
waitwhat since they worship something

278
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,020
that something has to destroy them

279
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,310
couldn't she destroy the world in a

280
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,630
million other ways that aren't nearly as

281
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,330
fallible I still don't know how this

282
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,100
witch possession works these subway cars

283
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,930
are being incinerated yet random people

284
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,400
are running past all this on the subway

285
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,779
platform without being affected by it

286
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,589
whatsoever

287
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,270
the first non-human entity ever attacks

288
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,680
Midway City and instead of calling

289
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,300
Batman who we apparently hate because

290
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,979
he's a vigilante we call The Suicide

291
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,570
Squad entirely made up of law-breaking

292
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,000
dickholes mixed sense also this is

293
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,250
exactly what we created Task Force x4 to

294
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,810
protect us against the which we put on

295
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,029
Task Force X Joker found the facility

296
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,470
where they make the nanite explosives

297
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,880
that are shunned by the suicide squads

298
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
NEX also he can save his girlfriend it

299
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,700
got that information from Griggs the

300
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,839
sleazy security guard at the prison

301
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,610
facility but how the fuck did he know

302
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,990
where they made that that's like asking

303
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,730
an employee McDonald's worth the cattle

304
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,350
for these burgers raised and then them

305
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,700
telling you the exact ranch where

306
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,680
they're capped a few things he sure they

307
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
broke into the lab but why would they be

308
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,650
able to hack into the government stuff

309
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,330
just because they did that and wouldn't

310
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,770
the slab which is a company owned by

311
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,630
Wayne Enterprises report they got robbed

312
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,310
or Batman won't find out they got robbed

313
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,660
and he'd tell the government about the

314
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,350
security breach

315
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,910
so having in Chang chrissa's heart

316
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,380
really doesn't mean when her brother can

317
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,050
just do this right we want to find how

318
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,880
much power that is or if you sharing it

319
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,320
makes you any weaker but just roll with

320
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,270
it and lo the unexplained got us did

321
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,890
Lesley begin her equally unexplained

322
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,020
plan to build an unexplained machine to

323
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
wipe out someone and lo and such I saw

324
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,820
this movie before it was called Man of

325
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,050
Steel and Independence Day two

326
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,180
with a sprinkle of Spider Man 2 I saw it

327
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,510
at the Museum of Modern Bowl so we're

328
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,040
sending in the fire guy the crocodile

329
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,810
guy the crazy chick and a guy who shoots

330
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,220
lots of bullets we're pretty sure this

331
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,220
will work somehow what on earth would

332
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,630
make you think that this event happened

333
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,950
a few minutes ago and everything you've

334
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,510
tried so far has been hilariously inept

335
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:10,130
the voices they really said the voices

336
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,360
really said to a band in the Brooklyn

337
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,860
accent she previously had for a few

338
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,339
scenes

339
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:15,350
military dude uses a knife to cut open

340
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,640
the sack when there's a perfectly good

341
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,890
zipper right there them Slipknot the man

342
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,080
can climb anything it's literally all

343
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,339
the character development this movie

344
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:23,600
will give this asshole before killing

345
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,920
him suddenly but even if that hadn't

346
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,150
been the case I descend the fact that

347
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,350
the great climber guy was named like

348
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,940
he's an uncapable prisoner what -

349
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,080
climbing walls and slipping knots have

350
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,089
to do with one another

351
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,370
so I got a guy who can climb that's his

352
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,649
power Superman eat your heart out you're

353
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:36,160
next

354
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,759
Jackson you got to nanite explosive it

355
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,079
seems to me that Amanda could have

356
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,790
simply told the powers that be that she

357
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,319
would stick a nanite explosive in their

358
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,120
necks to control this task force rather

359
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,199
than going with the I've got

360
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,999
Enchantress's heart so their method of

361
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,050
convincing the government about her

362
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,249
power if they didn't understand the

363
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,600
nanite explosive thing she could have

364
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,889
simply said I'm basically ripping off

365
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,420
Escape from New York and that would have

366
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,749
been the end of it barely John Williams

367
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,399
was unavailable to score this movie so

368
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,870
instead they let a tenth grader that was

369
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,189
high on mushrooms randomly picked the

370
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:03,819
soundtrack

371
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:06,670
well we some kind of Suicide Squad this

372
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,290
is the most roll credits in roll credits

373
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,319
that has ever credits to delay this

374
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,550
last-minute chick gets a rushed

375
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,350
flashback backstory and movie thinks I'm

376
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,670
gonna give a shit about her and movie is

377
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,339
wrong this is good of course that's her

378
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,689
name any relation to the Mortal Kombat

379
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:23,829
katana her sword traps the souls sounds

380
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:24,999
like we should have recruited her for

381
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,379
this task force rather than a bunch of

382
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,120
criminals it's great the Joker is coming

383
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,499
forward but where did she hide this

384
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,449
phone during this and how the hell did

385
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,069
Flag allow these prisoners soldiers to

386
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,600
go on search between the prison and the

387
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,829
start of their mission that's bad

388
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,999
soldiering right there it tells you

389
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,800
relax this is only the third least

390
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,629
believable survivable helicopter crash

391
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,779
in this movie slipknot introduced a mere

392
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,610
eight minutes ago is already did movie

393
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,319
offers a new entry into the most useless

394
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,730
and forgettable villains for the good

395
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,499
guys to mow down contest instantly

396
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,120
challenging the Kree from the Avengers

397
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,649
and the zombies from I am Legend these

398
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,149
faceless creatures are dragging flags

399
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,410
somewhere instead of just killing it

400
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,579
because they know they need to give

401
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,379
Deadshot or somebody time to save him no

402
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,329
doubt Deadshot is badass but I don't see

403
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,709
why a bunch of trained soldiers can't do

404
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,209
this very same thing he's random

405
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,290
monsters that just appeared out of

406
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,639
nowhere and have never been explained in

407
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,350
the movie our proof they need Deadshot

408
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,910
but I'm not buying it she kisses him and

409
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,529
he becomes a black bubbly soldier my

410
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,059
question is did she kiss every one of

411
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,679
the dozens of black bubble heads we just

412
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,059
saw Deadshot kill in the previous scene

413
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,589
cuz that's a lot kissing these

414
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,910
mannequins perfectly represent the

415
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,139
relationship I have with my daughter

416
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,670
Joker Tex without internal punctuation

417
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,439
and it's basically my aunt Tilly

418
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,449
this alien dickhead no Harley was in the

419
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:27,069
elevator then jumped down into the

420
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,839
elevator with her to fight he realized

421
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,160
this thing would have to manually open

422
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,779
an elevator door to access one of the

423
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:32,860
work panels to get into the elevator

424
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,470
shaft right so these were just stored in

425
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,480
the ceiling okay I'm sorry I'm always

426
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,889
thinking of the process by which they

427
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,480
turned these guys evil then pulled out a

428
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,100
bunch of ladders told them to go through

429
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,509
the ceiling tiles and told them the weep

430
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:44,800
of The Suicide Squad to show up

431
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,570
then like always movies aren't concerned

432
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,890
with your perspective of this battle

433
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,300
they all know you like loud noises and

434
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,800
the illusion of something exciting and

435
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,940
that's what they call an action scene

436
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,630
these days

437
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,399
this asshole does nothing for most of

438
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,110
the second battle in a row man yes I

439
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,640
know he eventually saves the day but is

440
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,170
there nothing he can offer between zero

441
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,490
and saves today this guy apparently

442
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,260
needs to be goaded into using his powers

443
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,970
now he realized why Diablo was

444
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,649
conscientiously objecting to using his

445
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,000
powers it didn't have anything to do

446
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,470
with killing his girlfriend it's because

447
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,730
he's one of the most powerful characters

448
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,019
in this movie and he could have made the

449
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,880
last 15 minutes go by and 5 does

450
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,230
chemically altering your appearance

451
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,029
require this mega dye from super high up

452
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,950
in a building I'll take scenes we only

453
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,810
included because we hired an a-lister to

454
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,640
play Joker and felt obligated for 800

455
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,620
Alex seriously everybody is gone after

456
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,420
that flashback except for Deadshot who

457
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,740
has been the leader of this thing for

458
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,370
the entire mission

459
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,959
you take flag or somebody would be

460
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,100
concerned about them not being with the

461
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,870
group but you'd be wrong so the mission

462
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,880
was to save Amanda all along and I guess

463
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,680
enchantress and her army here because

464
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,480
she needs them to get her heart but I

465
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,980
don't really know why it feels like she

466
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,910
could have zipped in and out of this

467
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,470
place herself if she wanted to even if

468
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,399
she was building some sort of machine

469
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,899
and I'm not sure how her army would have

470
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,670
been able to find a secret stairway and

471
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,230
punch the secret code to access this

472
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,640
room anyway and I guess Amanda didn't

473
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,750
tell them they were coming to save her

474
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,070
because of something something proved

475
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,329
their loyalty this movie doesn't lay

476
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,649
clear any of the motivations for the

477
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,029
characters so we have to take stabs or

478
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,470
what the plot is about she takes an

479
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,209
average person and she turns him into a

480
00:13:58,209 --> 00:13:59,620
soldier who can take a headshot and

481
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,520
still fight

482
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,959
not really they're pretty awful army

483
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,339
wise they might do well at one of those

484
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:04,720
haunted houses where the employees can

485
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,630
touchy though what the these people all

486
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,980
knowingly worked for a clandestine

487
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,690
agency and presumably had some level of

488
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,310
clearance or basic trust there is no

489
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,380
reason to shoot them all over the hell

490
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,029
you got permission from your bosses to

491
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,100
run this Suicide Squad right that is

492
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,149
just a mean lady yeah movie this is the

493
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,070
time for one-liner jokes just after the

494
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,660
unnecessary murder of several innocents

495
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,459
murder then one-liner that's the comedy

496
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,959
formula lead forth by Jerry Lewis I

497
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,120
think first inject it's not important

498
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,440
for you to know how the Joker hijacked

499
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
this military helicopter just know that

500
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
he did and be content that he's Joker

501
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
and can do anything not a joke earnest

502
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
men ensure they don't hit any good guys

503
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,170
by firing this way even if Joker did all

504
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,459
these things to save Hurley what a

505
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:47,079
terrible plan this is she could easily

506
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,000
be killed of course that might not be a

507
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
consideration for him but considering

508
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,820
everything he's done so far it's

509
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,199
ridiculous he didn't wait for a better

510
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,149
opportunity the military bombs the out

511
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,709
of this helicopter and they all survived

512
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,360
and god damn it

513
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,860
put up with to make sense videos and

514
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,110
then Harley survives this fall Jesus

515
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,489
Christ up started I think the safest

516
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:04,989
location in this movie is in a crashing

517
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,699
helicopter why even have a helicopter

518
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,110
crash if everybody's gonna survive all

519
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,459
of them this movie is a series of

520
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,899
helicopter crashes and people eating

521
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,879
large pieces of meat also you survive a

522
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,350
helicopter crash and you survive a

523
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,939
helicopter crash and after watching what

524
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:17,559
she thinks his Joker dying in a chopper

525
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,540
crash Harley understandably goes down to

526
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,860
street level and pounced on the roof of

527
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,480
a car in the rain because that's just

528
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,429
what you do in these situations okay

529
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,809
Harley has had her bomb disconnected is

530
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,459
presumed dead and could go wherever the

531
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,149
she wants

532
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:29,619
why is she sticking around to eventually

533
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:31,420
go back to torture prison my heart

534
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,480
returned I can finish my weapon yeah

535
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,009
because before you couldn't get that

536
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,869
done for some reason get the feeling

537
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,759
someone on the set was like isn't she

538
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,410
super powerful why hasn't she finished

539
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,730
her weapon if she clearly has the power

540
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,319
to do it and then somebody said let's

541
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,699
make it seem like she needed her heart

542
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,319
all along to do it and that'll shut him

543
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,269
the fuck up when does this end flak

544
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,040
character inside the movie says out loud

545
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,540
what everyone watching it is thinking

546
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,610
what we almost pulled it off no you

547
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,709
didn't he killed a bunch of bubbly

548
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,999
monsters and briefly rescued a

549
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,379
psychopath that is going to put you

550
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,100
right back in prison

551
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,449
that's not pulling at all that's

552
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,639
participating in a LARP and put that

553
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,470
where you phone I'm taking my kids to

554
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,389
Mom's thought I married a nice man with

555
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:09,100
demon tattoos all over his head faced in

556
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,019
75 percent of his body yes this guy's

557
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,489
backstory is that he got mad at his wife

558
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,110
for scolding him for criminal activity

559
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,119
and then he burned his family that's the

560
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,709
back story and this character deserves

561
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,269
no second chances even though the movie

562
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:25,749
gives him more wasn't she already free

563
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,579
of the nanite explosives anyway your

564
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:27,970
daughter

565
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,799
write to you every day and I hand

566
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,540
selected seven of those daily letters to

567
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,220
include in the small bundle also

568
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,230
emotional moment yes but flag was

569
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,819
traveling and doing combat this whole

570
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:38,259
movie with these letters stuffed in his

571
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:41,110
chest just in case my daughter was gonna

572
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,869
note it hurt daddy it's not a piece of

573
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,699
except for all those people I killed for

574
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,649
money I can't take that back but killing

575
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,179
a wig gets me points though Captain

576
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,589
Boomerang there was a boomerang which

577
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:51,879
apparently it doesn't boomerang at all

578
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,379
but flies like a drone into

579
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,329
Enchantress's lair and has a camera on

580
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,160
it that broadcast through his phone as a

581
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,199
flooded tunnel leads right underneath

582
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,910
that building because Killer Croc has

583
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,410
been worthless up to this point so

584
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,999
there's a flooded tunnel now so his

585
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,940
character could actually do something

586
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,440
and have killed her husband used that

587
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,420
sword yeah but who the fuck cares man

588
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,640
you don't fight with us what a fund was

589
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,320
control are we still debating about this

590
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,090
did Diablo do something good earlier

591
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,190
shouldn't he be over this by now I mean

592
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,930
not the killing his wife gets part but

593
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,000
the using fire for good part so that's

594
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,800
your old lady huh well you need to

595
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,770
handle this I get up there smack on our

596
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,370
ass

597
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,560
tell her knocked it off this movie is so

598
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,390
aggressively misogynistic but it briefly

599
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,220
hosted Access Hollywood I've been

600
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,620
waiting for you all night didn't

601
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,000
interest just now realize the Suicide

602
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,650
Squad was here what exactly are her

603
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,420
detecting powers did this take some time

604
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,710
or was she just letting them think they

605
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,470
were Harding and I know what you want

606
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,540
movie will now waste time showing us

607
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,160
what a few characters really want and

608
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,840
won't pay any attention to what I want

609
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,640
which is for the movie to end this dude

610
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,960
suddenly has horrible aim with his

611
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,820
tentacle things after wiping out most of

612
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,410
the human race he interacted with before

613
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,000
this all so why didn't chain tryst

614
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
bother with all that what everybody

615
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,030
really wants bulls and not just send

616
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,320
this guy in behind them to destroy them

617
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,480
in the first place there is no way

618
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,100
you've bonded to these assholes in a few

619
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,330
days time and have to consider them

620
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,490
family Hugh J Hernandez's character

621
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,080
whose name I forgot to show you what I

622
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,860
really am

623
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh Dom or would it have been nice to

624
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,820
know this character could Voltron into a

625
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,130
super tall fire guy before now yes yes

626
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,210
it would have but that would have

627
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,680
spoiled the X Malcolm I'll be honest

628
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
killer croc is underwater fighting bad

629
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,340
guys I've forgotten why or who or how

630
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,530
but I understand killer croc to be a

631
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,150
water based bad guy and therefore I

632
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,740
accept the existence of this scene even

633
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,530
as I send its forgettable Ness this

634
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,850
fight would really be interesting if we

635
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,320
had any clue about their powers or the

636
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,390
stakes or the rules or anything

637
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,960
resembling a plot my

638
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,160
took you long enough you got your heart

639
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,420
back a couple of hours ago

640
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,800
feels like the stupid machine should be

641
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,380
killing fools by now well there goes HBO

642
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,630
again which even know how to target this

643
00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:01,100
thing it's a secret facility Oh fight

644
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,840
against all-powerful which devolves into

645
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,880
hand-to-hand combat because of course it

646
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,530
does ant I thought we were gonna run out

647
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,970
of time but the movie managed to find

648
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,440
one more way to have a dude punch a

649
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,150
woman in the face oh look Killer Croc

650
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,800
finally made it to the battle after so

651
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,720
many minutes of whatever been doing that

652
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,460
is indeed of a Jenica and I'd be just as

653
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,900
offended as a moviegoer of hardly was a

654
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,160
dude and this was a kick to the balls

655
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,170
actually this movie is basically a kick

656
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,580
in the balls and a Rob Schneider cameo

657
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,050
away from being an Adam Sandler movie

658
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,810
yeah she could have done this like five

659
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,320
minutes ago

660
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,310
right that enchantress can't tell Harley

661

as bulky and doesn't notice the sword

662

663
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,650
after the entire movie of you being

664
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,480
worthless thanks for being nearby this

665
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,130
entire scene is done in slow motion for

666
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,990
a whopping 90 seconds so that the agony

667
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,580
can be greater during watching it oh and

668
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,630

669
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,520

671
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,320

675
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,560
