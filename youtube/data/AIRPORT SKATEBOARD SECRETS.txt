1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
yeah

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:11,160
yeah

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,689
yeah

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:33,770
well that tip for San Francisco I leave in four hours before then I have a

5
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,560
breakfast meeting some other uninteresting things

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,560
this was a quick trip

7
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,309
kk see why do you set up these elaborate shots for your blogs

8
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,309
I don't know it's fun it's like making a movie

9
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,899
Casey I want you to do

10
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:21,189
I'm doing well how are you today I just walked out of a meeting with my friend

11
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:21,700
Sam

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,700
they get inside this truck

13
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,909
who needs a truck that size in this city

14
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,729
I just left a meeting with my friends and the guy was running with yesterday

15
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:32,150
morning

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,090
he's a genius on my way to twitter right now for super quick meeting and then

17
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,990
I've got to get back

18
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,990
I gotta go to the airport flight back to New York City

19
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,570
with her

20
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,540
I can't figure out how to get into the building here

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,300
yeah

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,300
good luck on sunday

23
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,210
thank you

24
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,360
a few moments later is this the way out

25
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,819
we go to the meetings with these places you have to sign a nondisclosure

26
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,050
agreement

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:24,110
so I literally can't film in there the great meeting interesting folks and left

28
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:34,040

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,670

33
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,569
I'm gonna grab my dad's get the airport not a lot of time

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,050
I'm just trying to get a rumor to take me to the airport really running late

35
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,050
for the flight now

36
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,890
I think I found her how are you I'm fine thanks how are you I'm doing okay

39
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,670
key back at the airport

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,260
I wasn't bad dancer

41
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,130
I think he looking at your multi

42
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,920
some sort of issue with my bag securities give another once over

43
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,050
that was the most lovely light kind

44
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,040
tsa agent I've ever interacted with having to have my bags check was a

45
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
borderline pleasure

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,380
yeah

47
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,820
this report has the best food and the most expensive food of any airport

48
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,370
no that's it thank you what do you know

49
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,590
my lunch and two drinks were forty dollars and forty cents

50
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,669
forty dollars and forty-seven

51
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,350
yeah

52
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:18,650
yeah

53
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,129
all right time to catch the flight

54
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,839
it's so much work to do but never to sleep on this flight

55
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,289
pretty exhausted

56
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,449
Casey doesn't it put on the meeting well normally it's like a fist fight for me

57
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,529
to board first

58
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,800
that could call my name don't even behind me

59
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
yeah I'm great are you

60
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,110
sometimes when I met me on this really actually feel guilty like still working

61
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,110
and prepping the plane look

62
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:04,229
there's still not another person on this entire plane

63
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,469
not one other person because me and the crew

64
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,910
it no one no one

65
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,910
all right just checking back in still no one else

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
now i'm sitting down and there's no one else on the frame

67
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,090
like 10 minutes don't know what pick up someone here comes somebody

68
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm no longer alone

69
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:49,780
all right we got my shorts on and we go to sleep and wake up in New York City

70
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,770
- external community airport

71
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,090
your time for fun

72
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,449
a lot of thank you

73
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,580
yours

74
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,729
I woke up this morning at 3am in San Francisco

75
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,009
I was exhausted right on the point I didn't sleep for one second that a

76
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,939
really good movie selection by the way the main reason why i keep a skateboard

77
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,150
with me is to get through JFK Airport

78
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:36,219
it's probably an honest mile of walking to get from the plane to a car escaped

79
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,219
work just makes getting through the airport so much more efficient

80
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,099
it is positively warmer in New York City than it was in San Francisco

81
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,539
it's februari that is scary for a lot of reasons

82
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,320
yeah you Boris

83
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,010
ok hello how are you I'm good thank you very much

84
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,820
this is like my tent <operand> twenty </operand> of the day you see where I'm

85
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
going there

86
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,190
all right the baby's asleep so I have to stop recording before i go inside but I

87
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,290
went to San Francisco and back

88
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,630
that's like 7,000 miles of traveling in 36 hours

89
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,680
that's amazing

90
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:49,649
yeah

91
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:50,189
yeah
