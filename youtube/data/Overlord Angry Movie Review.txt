[Music]

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,010
hey guys we just got back from overlord

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,250
this what would you call this I don't

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,990
know war to grindhouse Sonny's zombie

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,470
movie and that mixes pare trooping in

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,460
World War 2

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,599
with a zombie horror film what did you

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,060
guys think combine both things that I

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,680
love horror and 19 old school yeah okay

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,360
excellent and this is sort of the

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,080
beginning of a bunch of holiday movies

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,610
there's a lot of movies for us to review

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,370
in November in December so this one

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,980
kicks it off is this one going worth

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,950
seeing in theaters I think so like this

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,660
is one that even if you like way maybe

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,790
I'll wait till Netflix the sound alone

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,320
for this film they did such a good job

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,880
and like you could feel I mean we were

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,229
in a really nice theater right where

21
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,400
there's actually speakers in the seats

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
too and it was nice there's a lot of

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,140
like really good war scenes that if you

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,520
can see it on the big screen with like a

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,110
really nice sound system I think you

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,530
should yeah so the film works as a war 2

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,440
paratrooper movie it was really exciting

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,200
the opening sequence of them doing the

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,380
the pair of jump into behind enemy lines

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,360
while under fire from all the flak

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,200
explosions was very immersive realistic

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,180
feeling so what I'm saying is the fur

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,979
the first half feels like a paratrooper

34
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,530
movie and I wanted to see the rest of

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,130
that let's jump in and kill some fucking

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,130
Nazis and I was like ok let's do this

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,130
but then you get that whore it slows

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,830
down considerably after they jump maybe

39
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,229
drags just a tad for me there but then

40
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,960
it works as a self-contained horror film

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,270
and you're mixing it a little bit with

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,110
the Nazi and the occult which is kind of

43
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,400
stuff that inspired Wolfenstein you know

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,930
it's been said that Hitler was

45
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,900
fascinated with the occult so that's so

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,760
this is that kind of film and it's got

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,860
this sort of little b-movie grindhouse

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,590
of flair that the opening

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,870
you know the opening titles they make it

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,120
look like a war film with the Overlord

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,769
and then they ended the film it looks

52
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,420
like a world war two propaganda film

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,280
that you're just seen I thought those

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,950
were nice little touches yeah I liked it

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,810
a lot this is like right up your alley

56
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,700
because you like bad horror films but I

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
think that the production value on this

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,330
was probably a little bit higher than

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,319
what you're produced by bad robot that's

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
JJ Abrams production company the

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,930
director I'm not really familiar with

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,420
this work a lot of the actors in this I

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,430
didn't recognize however there is one

64
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,519
and he looks creepily familiar I

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:09,049
couldn't put my finger on it Joe yeah

66
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:12,860
it's Kurt Russell son who plays the

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,180
explosive expert so the mission is

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,239
basically there's a radio tower

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,280
operations tower with not on a church

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,840
and these paratroopers have to go

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,849
destroy it they only have a few hours to

72
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,590
do it because you have the rest of the

73
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,840
soldiers gonna be performing the d-day

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
landing and this will help out and give

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,620
them them air support so they're on a

76
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,730
clock and he joins a team right there on

77
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,069
the plane the you know Kurt Russell sons

78
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,639
character as they're you know explosives

79
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,130
expert you have I think his name is Boyd

80
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,190
who is the main character of the film

81
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,269
and he is just this paragon of virtue he

82
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,790
is kind of annoying where it's like come

83
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,459
on we get it you're a good guy a little

84
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,549
bit of a cliche this character so and he

85
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:02,220
does a few things in the film and he

86
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,290
sort of acts out where kind of breaks

87
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,769
your immersion okay if he's that you

88
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,019
know of paragon of virtue and then all

89
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,880
of a sudden he's this I don't know

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,970
momentarily so it had a little bit of

91
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,780
those types of cliches in it but overall

92
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,770
I think it overcomes them with a very

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,349
entertaining conclusion

94
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,150
especially what do you think of the gore

95
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,639
in the film there was some really cool I

96
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,409
mean there was a lot of CG stuff but

97
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:32,640
there are some really cool practical

98
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,890
effects that were happening with some of

99
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,060
these mutant zombie

100
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,590
we things and I reluctant yeah I think a

101
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,260
lot for a lot of them Dom B stuff they

102
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,169
stayed away from using pure CGI which is

103
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,700
good you never want your zombies to be

104
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,620
pure CGI so you use a lot of practical

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,630
effects a lot of special effect makeup

106
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,960
that looks fantastic this is more glory

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,280
than say Halloween you know I and and

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,380
there are some sequences where they

109
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,320
discover the the serum in no spoilers

110
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,450
here but you know obviously in the

111
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,130
trailers there's the you see some of

112
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,610
this stuff and the serum is used in

113
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,070
order to make these these these zombies

114
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,290
Asians right and so there's some scenes

115
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,510
that you see in how how they how this

116
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,460
comes to be and how they transform and I

117
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,500
thought it was really well done yeah it

118
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,760
was actually surprising some of the

119
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,979
things they did I mean to not give it

120
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,139
too much away but he pulls the sheets

121
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,880
back on some of the experiments and it's

122
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,760
just wow that is jari yeah that's an

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,820
interesting thing that they did yeah I

124
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,800
don't know what else to say about the

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,950
film it's it's pretty straightforward

126
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,660
it's pretty sane know exactly what's

127
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,770
gonna happen if you've seen that the

128
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,919
preview that's what happens in the movie

129
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,020
yeah I really enjoyed it and uh it did

130
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,150
satisfy me for the horror element but I

131
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,210
still feel like those are some more that

132
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,710
could have been ventured into that

133
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,860
aspect I almost felt incomplete cuz you

134
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,780
had like a start of a really good World

135
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,640
War 2 movie and then you kind of had the

136
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,289
siblings in the end of a horror film

137
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,060
that you like I wanted either you to

138
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,530
finish this one or tell me like the

139
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,560
beginning exactly okay that I totally

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,940
agree with that Joe because like we said

141
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,860
when we were watching the film I was I

142
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,930
turn on jaws like this is really good

143
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,900
yeah and you know the opening of it when

144
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,860
they're doing the whole War two

145
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,169
paratrooper stuff when they land they

146
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,090
get a little bit of the atmosphere what

147
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,889
it's like to land you see some gunfire

148
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,419
in the background and the chaos of the

149
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,120
event and I'm like man this is good so

150
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,490
because the film is it's not really a

151
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,770
long film either it has to split its

152
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,070
time between two you know elements and

153
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,070
both are done well you wanted more you

154
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,080
wanted more of that paratrooper stuff

155
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,380
and fightin the German armed

156
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,960
and you wanted a little bit more zombie

157
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,350
stuff it's very difficult I'm going in

158
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,060
circles now because it's very difficult

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,280
to talk about without spoiling some of

160
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,410
its better moments in the film we're

161
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,240
trying to stay away from that what about

162
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,070
the performances these are a lot of

163
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,720
these people I have really I'm not

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,400
familiar with it you're not gonna get

165
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,280
any you know face actors people that you

166
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,560
recognize how do you think they did to

167
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
me they're like generic actors they did

168
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,490
her job it was fine it's satisfying well

169
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,070
you're on Greyjoy was the the German

170
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,730
officer

171
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,160
the guy from Game of Thrones yeah true

172
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,780
but he's not a big no he's not a big

173
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,970
name but Kurt Russell's son does an

174
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,190
alright job but again doesn't have the

175
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,100
star power so the it's the concept and

176
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,080
the premise of overlord that is gonna

177
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,300
draw people in and I really think it's a

178
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,370
fantastic concept and me and Joe were

179
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,080
saying man we've really hope this is

180
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,570
gonna be good please let this be good

181
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,810
and it wasn't bad and in my opinion it

182
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,000
was good I mean it's not an instant

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,250
called classic no it's not one that I

184
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,050
would probably I might one might see

185
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,630
this again you know when it comes out on

186
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,530
some like easily but would you buy the

187
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:09,260
DVD or anything like that yeah I can't

188
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,260
tell you I'm not buy the DVD because

189
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,890
that would have to be a 10 out of 10 all

190
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,450
right well alright well I don't want to

191
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,010
spoil too much so let's jump it let's go

192
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,620
ahead and and do some final verdicts but

193
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,270
before that I do want to talk about the

194
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,510
subplot so there there's maybe one or

195
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,400
two subplots going on here all the

196
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,500
soldiers get a tiny sprinkling a

197
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,210
backstory you've got it's sort of a a

198
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,599
Jersey guy from New York you've got the

199
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,050
the timid you know nerd type character

200
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,180
the photography it's a little sprinkling

201
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,300
here and there some cliches that do

202
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,280
their job right they don't really annoy

203
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,920
you but what do you think about the so

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,560
they're pair trooping into a French town

205
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,930
so you have this character named Chloe

206
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,170
and her little brother how did you think

207
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,230
that that didn't in I was thinking

208
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,880
they're gonna be off

209
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,070
putting very annoying but they were non

210
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,750
they were fine for the store for a

211
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,050
subplot I was okay I didn't love it

212
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,510
there was a parts where they focused on

213
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,440
the subplot to the point where it kind

214
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
of it was so jarring it kind of pulled

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,290
me out of the whole movie for like a

216
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,390
minute going this is kind of stupid like

217
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,610
you realized that they kept saying over

218
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,900
and over and over it's like well the

219
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,290
DJ's tomorrow at 6 a.m. and 150,000

220
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,460
people are storming the beach he's like

221
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,500
but I won't do the mission until we save

222
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,430
the little boy

223
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,890
it's like mm-hmm but but all those guys

224
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,020
are gonna die on the beach yeah I know

225
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm sorry about the little boy but like

226
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,890
this is this is what we're here for

227
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,500
it's a subplot threatened several times

228
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,810
to become the main plot yeah and and and

229
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,880
it's a little shaky on whether the

230
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,270
believability is there for that but the

231
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,150
boy himself does a good job you know he

232
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,340
doesn't get in the way you feel the

233
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,680
conviction and the strength from Chloe's

234
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,330
character so I think she did a great job

235
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,450
too so just wanted to mention that not

236
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,400
only is the main plot enjoyable

237
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,700
you get a nice climax with it but it

238
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,470
kind of goes pretty much how you think

239
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,880
it's gonna go there's no real spins

240
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,400
reveals nothing like that if you've seen

241
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,920
a lot of these types of you know horror

242
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,660
films and zombie movies this is done

243
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,580
well but they haven't done nazi zombies

244
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,500
a lot I guess they did what what film

245
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,260
was that not snow something that did

246
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,900
snow that's no you know what is this

247
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,540
better than dead snow I think so Wow you

248
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,550
waited on that one a little thinking

249
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,090
about it's like I forgot some parts but

250
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,740
maybe because this is fresh yeah yeah

251
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,900
what what's surprising to me is that the

252
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,990
zombies themselves do very little

253
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,290
killing in a sense it's not like that

254
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,750
World War Z where the zombies are coming

255
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,400
at you and you're having heavy gunfire

256
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,680
and stuff and you're trying to take care

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,110
of them it's more battles between bosses

258
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,900
and it feels very videogame ish at times

259
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,930
I think so yeah so let's go final

260
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,950
verdicts what would you give this Alex

261
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,740
seven I like seven I think this was

262
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,320
this was like threatening to be like a

263
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,480
nine out of ten for the first like 12

264
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,070
and watching this I'm going like I'm

265
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,779
getting into this like if they keep this

266
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,470
the whole way and then it kind of it

267
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,450
wasn't bad I mean it wasn't you know

268
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,880
like a it didn't go down to a five but

269
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,220
it just kind of it slowly went down and

270
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,779
there was the cliches there was that one

271
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,339
jarring moment which I don't buy it like

272
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,839
this is stupid and then it just kind of

273
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,550
got it won me back a little bit so I

274
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,470
think that this is a good movie it's

275
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,990
worth seeing in the theaters but it's

276
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,390
not a great movie yeah I'll give that at

277
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,209
seven in the beginning I really loved

278
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,040
that whole little Brotherhood that they

279
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,110
were going for and I want to see some

280
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,690
more that but there was no breakout star

281
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,490
the whole thing with the zombies so it

282
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,339
was a great concept I would know the

283
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,110
horror element for that I wish they

284
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,660
would explored it a little bit more but

285
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,570
it still satisfied me this is a good

286
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,860
movie for me seven okay yeah it's I was

287
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,600
hoping they wouldn't fuck it up and they

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,050
didn't plug it up now it starts so good

289
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,750
that I suffered a small disappointment

290
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,610
by the end because I was like goddamn

291
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,770
that was really a great opening with all

292
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,410
the paratrooper stuff and by the end it

293
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,839
picks it up a little bit but I was

294
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,850
hoping for a little bit more monster

295
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,440
battle action some of the sort of main

296
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,720
line troops rather than than just the

297
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,190
boss battles cuz you get your boss

298
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,430
battles and and the middle-drag just a

299
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,490
slight slight bit perhaps because none

300
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,940
of these characters have the charisma to

301
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,190
sort of pull you through all the

302
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,660
different scenes with the different

303
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,640
dialogue and stuff like that there's

304
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,190
some torture scenes that you know are

305
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,589
interesting but not quite you know like

306
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,720
you're really involved in them so I

307
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,470
think overall it's potential mmm like I

308
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,020
said it's yeah I'm on the fence I mean

309
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,120
it started out at it's a nine and then

310
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,890
as it went along and went to an eight

311
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,370
and then I think overall it's a seperate

312
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,339
and so seven out of ten for me as well

313
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,959
it's very first I don't know man we've

314
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,209
made years of these I'm sure

315
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,879
we have had you know scores all across

316
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,660
the board so 7 out of 10 for Overlord we

317
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,920
think it's worth checking out in the

318
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,649
theater so this weekend what I mean what

319
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,179
else is there you got Grinch you got

320
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,540
this and something else but it's this is

321
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,589
probably your best bet

322
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,959
all right so stick around we're gonna

323
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,420
have a spoiler section if you want to

324
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,579
take a look at that if not thank you

325
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:53,139

00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,749
cuz there they have their dirigibles

331
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,339
right and they're aiming their cannons

332
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,050
at the holes instead of the fucking

333
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,819
balloon that's hovering them through the

334
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:32,600
sky honorable pirate honorable pirates

335
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,999
horrible boat there's no wood shrapnel

336
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,670
pop in that balloon goddamnit do you

337
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,110
have to ruin everything there's things

338
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,749
that he loves but now you'll never stop

339
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:51,829
thinking oh yeah hey guys welcome to the

340
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,559
spoiler section for Overlord the world

341
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,889
war two zombie action flick so the main

342
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,290
plotline essentially there is I don't

343
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,879
know if I spoiled it should I have

344
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,949
mentioned the serum in the main one it's

345
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,670
in the trailer you get injected with it

346
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,829
so there's a serum and do they ever

347
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,930
really explain where the serum comes

348
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,240
from they mentioned they explained very

349
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,100
little which i think is a benefit right

350
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,439
cuz anytime you get it's important well

351
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,240
if you delve into the science or you try

352
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,769
to like make sense of something it's

353
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,209
like no that's stupid there's like we

354
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,009
found this goo it's under the village

355
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,959
they couldn't figure even mentioned goo

356
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,480
what is this goo I never heard them

357
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,600
mention I said these these French are so

358
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,040
stupid they didn't realize they were

359
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,259
they were standing right on it you know

360
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,209
or they they built right over it and

361
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,309
they never took advantage of it that's

362
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,290
the kind of reference that you get to

363
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,959
what the serum is however they have to

364
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,959
like run the serum through bodies first

365
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,759
yeah it's been refining their bodies we

366
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,920
find weird matrix like scenes where

367
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,019
these people are in these hanging bags

368
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,959
and there's like amniotic fluid or

369
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,309
something in there they could they pump

370
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,540
the stuff into them and then they

371
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,249
extract it out it was kind of graphic

372
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:03,379
that that part was let growl gory and

373
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,540
interesting and I'm surprised that when

374
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,429
he opened that bag and the person pops

375
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,350
out he's got a little mass but he said

376
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,819
you can still hear me help me you know

377
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:14,899
please kill me or something like there's

378
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,910
a severed head with a spine talking like

379
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,720
that was really fucking creepy so those

380
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,649
were some really

381
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,050
shot some really interesting things in

382
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,540
there but yeah they don't really mention

383
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,209
it other than that also unfortunately we

384
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,639
only get one zombie punch so we get like

385
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,309
zombies but you're right Joe descends on

386
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,199
me for the whole shot you get yes

387
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,290
technically get the boss battle but you

388
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,970
only have one zombie you got the soldier

389
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,389
zombie there buddy know what I'm saying

390
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,519
Joe I think is a meaning that you only

391
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,850
get one full-fledged ami that you get to

392
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,119
see and get to interact with as opposed

393
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,850
to bunch show up and then die off-screen

394
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,309
so let's mention all these so first the

395
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,279
aunt I wanted to see more with the on so

396
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,039
when he go when these soldiers go to the

397
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,319
French town they meet up with Chloe her

398
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,390
aunt is sick and she sounds like a

399
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,010
zombie behind that closed door I was

400
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,449
like this is interesting this is when

401
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,140
the movie is still like adenine what's

402
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,589
going and you've looked in there I

403
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,600
wanted to see a bed and some fucked up

404
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,370
shit but they fucked that part up a

405
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,110
little bit and she just uh you know

406
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,700
appears in the thing and then that's it

407
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,940
I told you my mom was sick and I thought

408
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,429
it could get a little a little bit

409
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,669
closed in on it but you never really get

410
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,289
to see the aunt she doesn't play a

411
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,059
factor in I thought maybe she'd attacked

412
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,919
those Nazi Souls they search the house I

413
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,510
thought oh man there's gonna be a nice

414
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,279
little scene with the aunt going fucking

415
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,190
crazy you know but no you just see some

416
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,460
come fire in the in the top upstairs

417
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,380
window and that just implies that they

418
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,529
shot up the don't want with no effort so

419
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,169
that's your first hint at design no the

420
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,880
first hand is you see like this messed

421
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,390
up little dog jackal thing we'll see I

422
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,220
thought those were when they Paris that

423
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,770
host though cuz like they just toss

424
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,740
those bodies aside they're not really

425
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,600
zombies they're just like host cuz he

426
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,510
filter that you see the same kind of

427
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,250
outbreak on those soldiers that they're

428
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,260
burning alive yeah I think the first

429
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,179
time you see is there's they're

430
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,120
torturing the German officer who's in

431
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,399
charge of the whole village and they're

432
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,130
interrogating him and he kind of sort of

433
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,950
he is

434
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,870
gapes there's a little bit of a scuffle

435
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,510
and then the German shoots the

436
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,280
photographer of the group and he dies

437
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,580
and then so he is one of the better

438
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,320
scenes when they inject that

439
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,510
photographer with the serum and he pops

440
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,550
right back up he comes I feel it yeah

441
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,860
freaks out and breaks his own spine it's

442
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,170
real weird yeah he crushes a can he's

443
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,390
got great strengths but then he starts

444
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:03,540
to convert he came back from the dead

445
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:10,800
the fucking zombie Joe my guys I got let

446
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,780
go in that little prison thing they're

447
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,400
looking for little boys I go check that

448
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,900
room they open the room

449
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,030
fucking zombie comes out starts chasing

450
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:26,400
her then in my eyes but yeah there's so

451
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,110
and then there's the boss battle the

452
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,450
main German investigator guy who was

453
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,140
searching the house for you know

454
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,220
American soldiers or deceived

455
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,480
something's up

456
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,870
he gets captured tortured my Kurt

457
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:46,470
Russell sons character and then Boyd is

458
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,770
our main character who was gosh I mean

459
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,470
he didn't want to harm a rat there are a

460
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,900
mouse they said in this story like a

461
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,340
sergeant told him you need to kill this

462
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,900
thing cuz rats shitting all over my

463
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,850
fucking pillow and he doesn't kill it

464
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,470
and he protects it and all this other

465
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,900
bullshit but then and he doesn't want

466
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,880
his friend to die so he injects his

467
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,860
friend with the serum I was thinking

468
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,420
they were gonna inject the Nazi guy

469
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,910
right yeah I was like that they have to

470
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,230
it's like what is this I'm not gonna

471
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,270
tell you well let's find out whoa right

472
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,330
but no their friend died so boy picks it

473
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,970
up and injects his friend cuz earlier he

474
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,310
saw somebody die and then kind of come

475
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,370
back to life with you so that's exactly

476
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,380
what happens here but then who takes out

477
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,030
this this zombie when he gets out of

478
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,840
control

479
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,440
it was Boyd and he does it in the most

480
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,310
gory aggressive way crush yeah and and

481
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,020
he's been so low-key the whole film be

482
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,720
holding back and so yeah there is a

483
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,570
moment where you feel like he's going to

484
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,490
blowed and actually kill something but

485
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,350
right Danny I don't know it just didn't

486
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,220
feel appropriate to his character yeah I

487
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,899
didn't like it I didn't buy it and then

488
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:00,210
I think the the next scene the very next

489
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,110
scene is the the part of the movie where

490
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,519
they're prepping for d-day there's less

491
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,679
than an hour or so until the soldiers

492
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
hit the beach and they're like we have

493
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
to blow up this tower and he's like no

494
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,960
we have to go save the kid and he's a

495
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,330
stupid cube it is like nowhere to save

496
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,860
the tower and he's like this is a direct

497
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,860
order we have to do this no no shoot

498
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,389
this guy in the face for being about one

499
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:28,320
kid 130,000 it's the kid but in our

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,840
opinion is bad writing because it's like

501
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,830
hey she saved us she brought us in she's

502
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,350
in trouble because of us I feel yeah but

503
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,970
there was none of that there was just I

504
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,590
want to save the kid it wasn't we have

505
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,029
to save the kid while we do this he's

506
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,200
like I'm not doing the mission we're

507
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,549
gonna go save the kid it's like why

508
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,590
don't you do both which is exactly what

509
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,940
they did so there was no point for the

510
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,970
whole scene yeah but maybe it could've

511
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,320
written the scene a little bit better

512
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
where Boyd would have went along if it's

513
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,639
let's do both and maybe the Sargent

514
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,679
character is lying to him so he can get

515
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,539
Boyd because there's only four fucking

516
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,120
soldiers to take on this little outpost

517
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,629
which is like 40 50 60 guys but there

518
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,330
they are like stormtrooper quality guys

519
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,519
where they cannot hit any weight

520
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,950
stormtrooper isn't real German yes yes

521
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,870
because if that's true then those are

522
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,600
the elite fucking soldiers are you

523
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,389
talking Star Wars stormtrooper yes okay

524
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:23,340
Star Wars this is an Abrams film or

525
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,259
produce film so they they couldn't hit

526
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,750
anything Germans killed two people in

527
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,870
this film two they murdered some woman

528
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,669
in a sea of throwaway scene to show you

529
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,549
how evil the Germans are and then as

530
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,409
they take villagers to perfect furnace

531
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:39,509
tests on and then when the the German

532
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,850
officer escapes he shoots he shoots

533
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,429
their friend and that's it yeah the one

534
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,379
that they were torturing the

535
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:48,419
photographer guy goes up to untie em

536
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,980
makes it da master so you could see it

537
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,659
coming from a mile away

538
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,909
and get shot in in the chest and then

539
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,070
that's when you get injected and turned

540
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,610
into the zombie so eventually they agree

541
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,240
they go into

542
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,940
the mission to try to get the boy and

543
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,390
the explosives but maybe but but at this

544
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,940
point Boyd is like no we have to do our

545
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,320
mission first she's like now I'm gonna

546
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,810
go get the boy now and boys like no I'm

547
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,210
gonna do division so I don't know a

548
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,220
little inconsistent maybe we missed some

549
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,800
lines or something because that was

550
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,610
explained and he's like see you know

551
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,820
she's not gonna wait she's gonna go now

552
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,470
so they go up to plant the explosive

553
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,530
like where she goes down to find her her

554
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,590
brother which she finds him rescues him

555
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,450
zombie and as they set up the explosives

556
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,820
well first we have to talk about the the

557
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,070
the lieutenant who escaped then not to

558
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,410
lieutenant gets shot in the face as he's

559
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,370
leaving and so he injects himself twice

560
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,390
twice and he's still living done done it

561
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,370
yet on somebody that's living so he

562
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,540
turns into a zombie boss and he looks

563
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,460
fucking coolest shit like his face is

564
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,980
blown off but then later on when I came

565
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,450
back to go to the bathroom and came back

566
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,820
the zombie makeup had changed

567
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,160
he doesn't look exactly the same as he

568
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,020
looked when they first revealed his face

569
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,150
was fucked up cuz I required hardcore

570
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,580
CGI a little bit in addition to

571
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,230
practical effects then when he's

572
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,760
fighting later on in the climactic

573
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,640
battle it's a little less of an effect

574
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,530
so I noticed that just because I left

575
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,720
for half a second but yeah so then it's

576
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Ford Kurt Russell son it has this epic

577
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,490
battle with him right mm-hmm

578
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,620
and he loses you get beat up real band

579
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,870
gets put on a hook and then he pulls

580
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,340
himself off the hook and falls the

581
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,590
ground and grabs a serum and becomes a

582
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,600
monster himself to fight the monster he

583
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,730
does this because he's got to save his

584
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,400
buddy a Boyd who comes in and just as

585
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,020
you know he's messy he's about to kill

586
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,700
for the explosions expert would comes in

587
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,070
and shoots him and he shoots him in the

588
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,700
chest even though he's the one that

589
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,270
destroyed the zombies by you know

590
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,610
smashing that head and that ad was nasty

591
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,010
looking in the camera made a point

592
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,890
oh it so boy knows how these things are

593
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,120
killed but he just shoots them in the

594
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,100
chest of course that doesn't work they

595
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,470
go on the battle and then American

596
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,390
injects himself and then you know they

597
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,280
fight they have this fight and it's cool

598
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,980
and but then he's like okay our side

599
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,500
can't have this power either you go

600
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,680
ahead locks himself inside his blow the

601
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,480
whole place up the other zombies start

602
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,000
to wake up and you're like okay we're

603
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,290
gonna get a fucking bad-ass fucking

604
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,940
fucking punching all these zombies and

605
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,870
shit doesn't happen there's get blown up

606
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:55,720
gets ready for it right but no he

607
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,510
himself uses the lighter from the Nazi

608
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,830
lieutenant and he's like alright I'm

609
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,550
done with it

610
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,150
and you know the lieutenant comes up cuz

611
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,310
he had knocked him down some well and

612
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,470
whole thing explodes that's the end of

613
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,900
the movie right there well you know boy

614
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,150
it's in this nice shop where Ford tells

615
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,280
him he's like hey whatever we saw down

616
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,840
here you can't tell anybody

617
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,550
yeah we don't secretly runs out of the

618
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,350
building and it's nicely done and one

619
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,420
full shot of him coming out of the bill

620
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,690
did you like that scene so the problem I

621
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,310
had with it is he would like run down a

622
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,900
hallway and he looked to the right and

623
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,310
then that way would be exploding so he'd

624
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,870
go to the left - we got to another scene

625
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,340
where he no matter where he looks it

626
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,740
explodes and then it just kind of got

627
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,380
silly like bad old sci-fi shows cuz he'd

628
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,520
run there and all of a sudden a pipe

629
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,140
with steam would burst and he has to go

630
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,820
oh no I have to run this way now a

631
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:53,590
paranoid I think some of that kind of

632
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,440
stuff in the film is done on purpose

633
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,300
it's done with a little bit of b-movie

634
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,310
flare on purpose it's done with a little

635
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,770
bit of grindhouse flare on purpose and

636
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,510
you could tell that by the end credits

637
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,900
and the start credits so I didn't mind

638
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,330
some of that but basically Sargent asked

639
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,010
him is there anything down there whether

640
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,200
we got to you know it might be

641
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,510
interested in nope other than the radar

642
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,250
that was destroyed but I'm surprised

643
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,290
that with only four soldiers they made

644
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,360
it out with almost everybody in fact

645
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,730
they rescued one soldier the the nerdy

646
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,659
guy

647
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,179
it was being experimented on and he as

648
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:33,429
as he was rescuing he had to pull this

649
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:36,269
big fucking tube out of him with a damn

650
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:39,129
needle on it and I thought okay is there

651
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,499
gonna be an after credits is there going

652
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,179
to be a little revealed that yeah he

653
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:45,070
made it out and they're all kind of in

654
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,070
the hospital tent you know just it turns

655
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,440
out the New Yorker jerk has now friends

656
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,739
with the little kid you know that kind

657
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,149
of stuff where it's all wrapping up

658
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:57,009
nicely and you see the solder that they

659
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,019
rescue just I gotta convince people that

660
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,970
ice helped you know and the war and

661
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,759
stuff but I thought that they were gonna

662
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,460
do something with that like you know

663
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,039
there's something like that where but no

664
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,299
they just get all right you know what

665
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,609
and they don't get to go home ladies

666
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,529
like we're gonna fold you into C Company

667
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,080
yeah you gonna fight some more more

668
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,299
people but I do think that that kind of

669
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,700
potentially sets it up and they didn't

670
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,249
and what I hate is when films just

671
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,440
fucking sequel bait you know what I mean

672
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,330
and it's an insulting ending this one

673
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,820
gives you one full complete story and it

674
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,220
wraps it up into this is why there was

675
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,559
never any occult stuff and you never

676
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,029
found out what Hitler was doing because

677
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,769
it was all right here and it got

678
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:40,869
destroyed and then history goes on as

679
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,239
normal or if it does really well at the

680
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,279
theaters they could potentially do an

681
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,950
overlord to because it's still Operation

682
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,570
Overlord a little bit technically as

683
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,659
they fold into Company C go on the guy

684
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,669
turns into a zombie as they're out there

685
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,369
fighting tanks and shit and then it does

686
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,429
it again I actually would like that just

687
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:03,249
because it would force the location out

688
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:05,769
in the open where the film was the best

689
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,749
out in my opinion the paratroopers stuff

690
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:09,970
the war stuff that was really really

691
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,759
cool so if you fold that in into more of

692
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,580
the war and have the zombie outbreak

693
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,859
happening while the war is happening and

694
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,570
just go crazy with it that would be

695
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,700
fuckin but he wasn't used like y'all

696
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,429
grease but he was used as a refinery he

697
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,169
wasn't he wasn't injected with the serum

698
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:28,330
they were just refining it in his system

699
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,649
like those people didn't turn into

700
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:32,859
zombies Callie I mean that's not how it

701
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:34,929
worked and then he's not he's not like

702
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,820
they're not voodoo zombies or raids on

703
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,679
before I bite you he turns into a zombie

704
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,749
it's just like I would love that right

705
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:41,809
where if there's a zombie up

706
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:42,919
in the battlefield and cool stuff

707
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,279
happens but they set it up where we

708
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,779
don't think well we don't know that if

709
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:49,369
you bite something yeah you're

710
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:50,960
absolutely right you pay more attention

711
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,879
and that's probably why they didn't have

712
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,889
the art scene that I wanted you know

713
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:56,330
that on see because she's not a zombie

714
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,389
she's just all fucked up from having

715
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:03,229
been used as a fucking carcass you know

716
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:06,919
as a fucking they probably let her out

717
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,779
of the zipper bag and let her go home

718
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:11,299
you know they're done with her yes and

719
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:13,039
she's all fucked up

720
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,259
so she was mercifully killed by those

721
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,659
people and those Nazis so yeah all right

722
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:20,479
well so that's about as many spoilers as

723
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:23,960
I can think of no after credit scenes so

724
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,619
don't worry about that what else that

725
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,969
guy's head exploding when they put a

726
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:31,460
grenade in his mouth was cool yeah so I

727
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,839
was like how the hell are they gonna get

728
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,539
into the complex with so many soldiers

729
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:38,989
out there and a fucking half track you

730
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,969
know and there's only four of them well

731
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,099
they take the sniper who's really really

732
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:44,749
good shot and then they take the one

733
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:46,219
that they rescued who apparently is I'm

734
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,139
able to operate a heavy machine gun with

735
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,089
just one person a little bit slower

736
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,779
although they capture one guy who's just

737
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,779
saying so no I bought it - I think

738
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,299
they've dropped it in there's arias this

739
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,989
is a two-person weapon so they shoot

740
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:07,639
also supposed to be done and I'm glad

741
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,440
they must have some script doctors to go

742
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,269
in and try to explain some of this stuff

743
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,710
even though that one I probably would

744
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,239
have bought even if nobody said anything

745
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,609
you know what I mean but people who are

746
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:21,649
into World War 2 stuff pop my head

747
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,839
operate that gun that fast with just

748
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,429
what Arnold's walking around with one

749
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:30,169
hit Nara - bro - that guy had was just

750
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,330
injured he was used as a refinery like

751
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,450
he's hurting all right the problem there

752
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,399
was 40 dudes and they couldn't hit one

753
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:41,210
guy yeah Nazis killed nobody F after

754
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,339
after they the first addict seen I mean

755
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,839
I think they nicked his shoulder or

756
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,249
something right because he was all

757
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,960
bandaged up afterwards because always

758
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,210
you ran in the street to go save a

759
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,019
little kid yeah all right well now we're

760
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,580
just beating up on the movie but

761
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,020
what we do here in the spoiler section

762
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,930
cuz these guys just pick things out so

763
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,480
liked it ya know it's it's good but this

764
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,250
is where we would discuss here

765
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,730
good grind house zombie war to film and

766
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,280
in my opinion since I have only seen

767
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,530
sections of dead snow I think it's the

768
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,900
best World War two zombie thing that

769
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,690
we've got outside of video games I would

770
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,080
tell you to play some Wolfenstein

771
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,090
especially some of the newer ones and

772
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,010
and you can get that same kind of movie

773
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,900
like flare but to see it up on the big
