00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:10,669
everyone knows you can't trust sweets

3
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,740
that's overtly sweetest Japan has a

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,749
perfect record we're number two we try

5
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,000
harder guys if we failed wait a minute

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,199
weren't they just on the second floor

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,490
how'd they get down to the first floor

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,320
in the middle of that sentence they even

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,230
listening movie hilariously declares

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,880
itself as a clever send up of the horror

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,650
genre and it's so fucking great I have

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,150
to remove us in look I don't care how

13
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,769
wink wink it's this movie is there's no

14
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,419
way Dana would be prancing around in her

15
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:33,680
panties with in full view of the

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,390
neighborhood and with the window open

17
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,030
professor quad wow this movie went balls

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,620
deep in the cold-cocking got Bechdel

19
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,329
test into smithereens right off the bat

20
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,520
didn't it and if Holden's cute as Kurt

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,260
says he is wow this movie broke the

22
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,210
Bechdel test twice in 30 seconds that's

23
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,859
a failed Bechdel test inside a failed

24
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,140
Bechdel test which is like still like

25
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,000
two Bechdel test was this dude waiting

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,960
for the football to come through the

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,230
window

28
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,359
considering that Thor told the women to

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,699
think fast my guess is no he wasn't also

30
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,260
didn't this guy driving see this dude

31
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,400
out in the street before he slammed on

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,049
the brakes there was an issue before the

33
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,030
ball was thrown right and you have no

34
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,450
pants

35
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,340
yeah but she's been dancing in front of

36
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,900
open windows all day so I highly doubt

37
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
she's all that concerned still even if

38
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,049
he was it's highly doubtful that she

39
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,520
would have forgotten this he blown this

40
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,170
town driving a very counterintuitive

41
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,600
manner the comically large coffee travel

42
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,100
mug bong is brought to you by Cheech

43
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,290
Marin Starbucks collection cops will

44
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,360
never pull over a man with a huge bong

45
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,280
in his car well sure right when he's

46
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,549
white why did these people hang out with

47
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,020
Marty this is a mix of people that

48
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,640
walked out of the J Crew catalog but

49
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,229
they pal around with one super hippie

50
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,820
guy that's high all the time he's good

51
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,290
for a few laughs sure but this is a

52
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,820
four-person trip with five people if you

53
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,390
know what I mean

54
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,670
nest is empty or right on time how long

55
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,259
is this asshole been on the roof what if

56
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,850
they'd left from Kurt's house and why

57
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,020
didn't they leave from Kurt's house

58
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,060
considering it's his van what shit

59
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,040
Daniel Truman said this outfit that's

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,659
highly reliant on security decides to

61
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,100
make an important new hire on their

62
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,899
biggest day of the year this close sign

63
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,130
makes me think maybe this place is

64
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,549
closed

65
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,439
my cousin bought a house up there you go

66
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,939
through like an Mountain tunnellers in

67
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,539
Lake

68
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,490
so is Kurt's cousin complicit in this

69
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,590
crazy conspiratorial crusade and later

70
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,150
Dana says she thinks Kurt doesn't even

71
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,830
have a cousin so what the fuck was a

72
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,300
story behind this can

73
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,440
that they later prance around in

74
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,150
swimsuits it's obviously a beautiful and

75
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,770
temperate day but Marty needs four

76
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,490
layers to keep him nice and snuggled

77
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,050
southern CVI eagle of Sutton instead

78
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,030
only for us the audience a real eagle

79
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,260
would have sniffed out the danger and

80
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,730
flown far away from this bullsh but

81
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,020
whatever also this is one of the few

82
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,730
missteps this movie makes showing us

83
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,990
this electronic and visible security

84
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,940
grid right now is dumb we've got plenty

85
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,290
of evidence something is funky from the

86
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,580
cuts to Bradley Whitford and Richard

87
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,440
Jenkins and this undercuts the potential

88
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,150
shock of the later scene when the elder

89
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,650
Hemsworth motorcycles himself into the

90
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,210
grid and dies a hilarious and shocking

91
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,680
death why did they need a camper to

92
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
drive out to the cabin it's clearly less

93
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,830
than a day's Drive and the cabin is

94
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,120
where they're all sleeping they could

95
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,500
have all fit into Marty's Volvo and

96
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,900
saved on gas let's park super far away

97
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,280
from the cabin so we have to drag all

98
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,600
our gear in just a really long way

99
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
brilliant how we're slowing down

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,490
cognition the hair dye dumb blonde very

101
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,800
artistic works its way into the blood

102
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,290
the scalp or you could spend much less

103
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,880
time and money recruiting Dumber kids

104
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,860
there are literally millions of horny

105
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,510
athletic bookish drunk and virginal

106
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,070
teenagers out there but they had to pick

107
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,540
the ones that are academic all-stars

108
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,150
the Lambs have passed through the gate

109
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,800
they are come to the killing floor so

110
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,209
wait this is a professional setting

111
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,770
where people in lab coats construct

112
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,450
horror scenarios but this guy is an

113
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,250
actual horror movie nutjob how do you

114
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,239
find these guys to work for you

115
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,890
Craigslist this is super impressive

116
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,750
information but now that they keeping

117
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,310
track of the pulse and blood pressure

118
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,510
there aren't any electrodes on their

119
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,040
bodies no they've already been picked

120
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,000
what

121
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,430
No who took him maintenance maintenance

122
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,050
they picked the same thing every year

123
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,610
then why would you have tried to submit

124
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,620
their pic as your own also rounds an

125
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,150
intern so it's odd that he would know

126
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,800
what maintenance picks every year how

127
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,239
long has he been an intern are the

128
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,890
career paths that tough to advance in

129
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,720
the shady secretive religious NSA style

130
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,770
operation no it's gambling casually on

131
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,330
actual human deaths letting off steam

132
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,709
would be playing ping-pong in the break

133
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,150
room or jamming to Bon Jovi in the

134
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,800
locker room yeah we rigged the game as

135
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,290
much as we need to but in the end they

136
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,060
don't transgress they can't be punished

137
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,800
this is still a weird system if they

138
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,660
need the victims to make the wrong

139
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,580
choice or it doesn't count then how

140
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,019
about all the other manipulations that

141
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,549
led them to that wrong choice they

142
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,750
basically changed the people through

143
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,609
chemicals in so how does that not factor

144
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,310
into it

145
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,600
please enjoy the music while the camera

146
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
follows this girl's ass through the

147
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,960
cabin I dare you to make out with that

148
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,880
wall this is the first dare out of the

149
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,770
gate it just started this game and the

150
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,510
stone motherfucker dials up the dares do

151
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,370
11 right off the bat forcible wolf

152
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,430
tonguing also they all clap for her

153
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,260
instead of vomiting the wind must have

154
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,970
blown over because that's the thing that

155
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,880
happens that makes what kind of sense I

156
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,890
spoke too soon but also stoner guy would

157
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,510
be excellent at cinema since what do you

158
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,290
think's down there

159
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,060
I don't know but by god it better not be

160
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,950
another being infinity stone yeah

161
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,700
Tennyson to some weird like collecting

162
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,290
memorabilia from old Tom Hanks movies

163
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,330
okay he opens a music box this chick

164
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,890
takes a necklace off a mannequin this

165
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,750
idiot touches some film and this Thor

166
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,040
motherfuckers tinkering with the sphere

167
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,930
but this movie will choose this girl's

168
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,760
diary opening as the act that decides

169
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,960
which evil creature will assault these

170
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,970
people Jules doesn't put the necklace on

171
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,530
just because Dana said something and

172
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,700
even if this would have stopped her for

173
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,780
a moment she definitely would have put

174
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,100
it on anyway while she waited for Dana

175
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,860
to speak April for father was cross with

176
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,410
me and said I lacked the true faith

177
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,670
Ruby reads part of the script to the

178
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,750
witch several years before it was

179
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,210
written I have found it in the oldest

180
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,730
books the way of saving our family too

181
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,020
bad these people aren't good enough at

182
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,400
cinemasins or else they would have asked

183
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,020
themselves why Ana patience Buckner

184
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,190
didn't just say this Latin phrase

185
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,600
herself while she was still alive to

186
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
write it in a diary

187
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,330
30 straight pink seconds of zombie

188
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,740
rising footage that's too dark to tell

189
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,000
what the hell these things actually look

190
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,860
like hang on you're telling me that out

191
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,360
of all the departments no one took

192
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,220
demons that's bullshit man I'm calling

193
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,990
bullshit on this death sports book also

194
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,060
damn it I have to take one set off for

195
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,380
the movie referencing the Deadites in

196
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,820
the Evil Dead trilogy stop entertaining

197
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,980
me so much movie yes you did yes you had

198
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,290
zombies but this is zombie redneck

199
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,660
torture family see they're entirely

200
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,520
separate species yeah but how do you

201
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,440
distinguish between witches and sexy

202
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,830
witches

203
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,540
isn't that a subjective thing okay I got

204
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,130
a boner for the ugly witch too looking

205
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,300
at this board how the hell were they

206
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,260
supposed to choose half the things

207
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,280
written here while they were in the

208
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,580
cellar

209
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,010
everything in our staple is remnant of

210
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,990
the old world my god we have this newbie

211
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,340
on the team so we can get some proper

212
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,290
expositing you get used to it

213
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,180
should you overly ethical guys in the

214
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,520
wrong job I am never gonna see him on

215
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,830
that ever can't he just go down to the

216
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,850
place where they keep the Merman and

217
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,720
request to see it

218
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,520
we need the Japanese crew to get it done

219
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,020
the shot of the ghosts in Japan is

220
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,460
goddamn hilarious but I'm tempted to

221
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,930
remove a sin but the fact that the

222
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,250
director needs an athlete

223
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,230
and a fool in addition to a scholar and

224
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,090
a virgin for proper sacrifice makes this

225
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,830
grade school setting definitely sinful

226
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,120
they came up from the basement and this

227
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
girl was still so sexed up she did a

228
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
twerk dance in front of the fire and

229
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,590
everyone forgot the basement full of

230
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,450
freaky some of which they touched though

231
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,920
to be fair we're eyewitness to this

232
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,930
particular fireplace dance I also would

233
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,280
have forgotten basically my entire life

234
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,690
up until that moment he's on full

235
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,000
academic scholarship and now he's

236
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,860
calling his friend an egghead

237
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,390
we got the explanation about the dumbing

238
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,250
Jules down from the hair dye but what

239
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,720
skirts excuse for suddenly turning into

240
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,860
a Neanderthal Payne lives the flesh only

241
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,480
they brought that thing back upstairs

242
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,410
with him why wait a minute when Dana

243
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,550
read that Latin thing a minute ago she

244
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,140
said it was nothing like she knew what

245
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,520
it meant before she read it assuming it

246
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,200
was gibberish now we find out she

247
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
doesn't know Latin at all so why the did

248
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,210
she think it was nothing okay baby show

249
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,310
us the goods does it really matter if we

250
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,510
see we're not the only ones watching

251
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,200
Kent

252
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,090
gotta keep the customer satisfied this

253
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,800
scene makes no sense as long as the gods

254
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
know that she's a whore that should

255
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,600
suffice

256
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,070
but they make the fact that we need to

257
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,020
see Jules Jules a requirement for the

258
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,740
sacrifice does satisfy and the customer

259
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,150
also mean that the zombie redneck

260
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,860
torturer family stabs hands before they

261
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,690
stab something more vital also I suppose

262
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,580
that satisfying the customer also means

263
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,200
having a lot of quick cuts during a dark

264
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,460
scene so you don't know what the fuck is

265
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,900
going on how did they get the blood from

266
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,160
the cabin grounds to the temple so

267
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,200
quickly pop quiz are these two kissing

268
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,430
because they actually hit it off her

269
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,780
because everyone else in this cabin has

270
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,070
disappeared after a bunch of sexy

271
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,010
dancing thought there'd be stars this is

272
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,240
a tip-off to him that he's not in

273
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,710
reality and that'll be important later

274
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,330
but the sin is for the fact that these

275
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,190
detail obsessed horror movie making

276
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,660
business underlings down under never

277
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,550
thought to put stars in the sky like not

278
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,600
even once how the hell did Kurt run all

279
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,770
the way up to Marnie without making one

280
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,669
bit of noise he just said she was dead

281
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,290
so you're basically saying you don't

282
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,000
believe it thought he's a jock dickhead

283
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,530
but still he was her boyfriend who

284
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,970
enjoyed finger well-reasoned does he

285
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,339
have right now do I

286
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,419
this zombie redneck torturer dude

287
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,979
bothered to carry Jules head all the way

288
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,570
to the cabin some what for the scares

289
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,490
but mainly because he's an asshole no

290
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,930
matter what happens we have to stay

291
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,080
together

292
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,870
calm down watch the master work by

293
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,130
pressing some buttons and releasing

294
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,600
chemicals into the air what a freakin

295
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,760
master also how does Hadley not know

296
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,930
about the magic chemical that makes

297
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,400
people want to split up rather than stay

298
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,870
together guys been on the job since at

299
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,060
least 1998 also there's a chemical that

300
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,410
makes you want to split up but not stay

301
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,390
together also why is Kurt the only one

302
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,710
of them that's affected by this terribly

303
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,660
specific decision-making gasps this

304
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,580
outfit surveillance gear so tight a high

305
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,470
as stoner just discovered it after

306
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,480
knocking over a goddamn lamp chem

307
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,250
department I need 500 cc's of Thorazine

308
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,220
pump into room 3 no no no no dude a

309
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,500
Buckner to the rescue yeah but why not

310
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,760
just go ahead and pump the Thorazine

311
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
anyway I'm sure there have been people

312
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,850
that have survived five intraoral

313
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,770
attacks directly to their spine but I'm

314
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,670
guessing they typically don't

315
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,529
immediately go on a walk fight and

316
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,540
eventually be the hero my point is Marty

317
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,310
is fucking dead and despite no proof of

318
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,690
the stoners death these underground

319
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,220
business assholes go ahead and pull the

320
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,080
second death lever prematurely I mean

321
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,670
they were monitoring their health right

322
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,170
also we eventually discovered this is

323
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,820
zombie Judas blood since he's been

324
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,740
killed by Marty somehow but do zombies

325
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,839
even have blood and if they do is it

326
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,180
this red human color thank God for that

327
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,040
two-way mirror earlier so that he could

328
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,630
see this and saver am i right he came

329
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,130
back to life after the crowbar stabbing

330
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,690
so let's stab him with a knife over and

331
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,910
over god this girl is stupid also this

332
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,380
is the problem with monsters even in

333
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,970
meta horror movies the zombie can't be

334
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,560
killed even if it's been dismembered but

335
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,150
for whatever reason it stops on being

336
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,500
after Dana knifes him in the chest a few

337
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,360
times this guy got a metal claw to the

338
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,890
back that pulled him up to the ceiling

339
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,360
he should not be able to stand up and do

340
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,010
regular right now how'd the ever-loving

341
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,839
does Curt know this did he climb down

342
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,550
into a cave pool and have a vision while

343
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,810
we weren't watching okay gonna take off

344
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,279
three Sims here for this scene it's

345
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,500
pretty damn hilarious also even though I

346
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,060
love the scene I'm gonna ask why does

347
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,529
Japan need to kill 20 innocent

348
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,120
schoolgirls while America has to kill

349
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,650
five stupid college kids what's the

350
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,420
minimum amount of death required doesn't

351
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,589
need to be a hundred percent there could

352
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,820
they get away with killing only three or

353
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,529
four people and calling it a day also I

354
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,970
go back to the satisfied customer thing

355
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,920
if they demand nudity and sex then Japan

356
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,240
already failed with this nine-year-old

357
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,860
schoolgirl scenario in the bag how hard

358
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,510
is it to kill nine-year-old it's obvious

359
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,130
Japan and the u.s. have both succeeded

360
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,080
in sacrifice in previous years and maybe

361
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,060
even more countries have so what happens

362
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,589
that shouldn't they get a bonus year if

363
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,120
they deposit more than one sacrifice per

364
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
year whatever you

365
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,460
Racing 2 in order to close the tunnel he

366
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,020
has to go through locker rooms and that

367
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,010
just feels like a total and complete

368
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,460
failure of planning we didn't get the or

369
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,290
didn't get the order you mean there's a

370
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,760
scenario by which you wouldn't have

371
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,410
caused that cave-in wouldn't this just

372
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,000
be standard protocol to cave in the

373
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,980
tunnel under every circumstance out of

374
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,750
does he know how to do that he just ran

375
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,730
from his usual post and king hot-wired

376
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,860
someone else's to explode instantly out

377
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,960
of also they blew the tunnel manually

378
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,160
which could have ended up killing these

379
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,900
guys on its own which if I'm watching

380
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,190
this movie correctly means they would

381
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,810
have this whole thing up by killing them

382
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,120
like this and hold back he's about to

383
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,500
jump a gorge and try to rescue everyone

384
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,480
and you tell him this because you are a

385
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,220
screenwriter cliche of a character don't

386
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,080
hold back man give it your all don't get

387
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,790
up beat all you get this bad ass reveal

388
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,200
completely neutered by the previous

389
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,610
scene of the eagle flying into the grid

390
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,870
and falling thanks for tipping your

391
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,700
hands super early movie also this force

392
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,990
field is totally against what this

393
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,640
institution is about and it's kind of

394
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,110
strange that even bothered to install

395
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,580
this thing because if there are any

396
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,320
witnesses to watching someone try it go

397
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,760
across it doesn't the whole scenario is

398
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,080
suddenly called into question another

399
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,490
thing how are they getting the blood

400
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,960
from these people and how does the blood

401
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
travel from anywhere in their little

402
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,960
horror park to the right place does a

403
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,340
little needle poked out of the ground in

404
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,900
any random spot they happen to die and

405
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,610
then that is connected to some other

406
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,930
system which delivers the blood to the

407
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
inner sanctum ok no matter what happens

408
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,500
got a stick are you telling me this

409
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,880
asshole was just waiting back here

410
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,290
biding his time looking for a dramatic

411
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,000
opportunity to kill this dude she's

412
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,810
still alive

413
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,850
the Virgin's death is optional as long

414
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,680
as it's last and convenient to the plot

415
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,780
also they assume she's the virgin but

416
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,310
has anyone made an attempt to keep Dana

417
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,720
safe from being killed before anyone

418
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,100
else she could have been axed by the

419
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,140
intruder to a room long ago this redneck

420
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,580
zombie dick hasn't killed Dana yet

421
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,900
apparently he needed to work on his

422
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,760
biceps before killing her working out is

423
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,830
so inconvenient absolutely totally dead

424
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,630
and super tardy stoner ex machina a

425
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,000
super tardy Marty party also not only

426
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,530
can a copy Vaughn hold up to a heavy

427
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,900
metal chain and claw weed can cure a

428
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,950
severed spine

429
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,140
who knew also Marty killed zombie Judah

430
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,790
out of the camera view but he still had

431
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,740
to walk all this way back to the dock so

432
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,030
why didn't the cameras pick him up then

433
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,890
zombie that we'll never see again is

434
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,350
still alive just FYI

435
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,610
marty is suddenly a capable electrician

436
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,020
because everyone in this movie has the

437
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,820
gift of convenient characteristics he

438
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,080
successfully got this elevator to go

439
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,970
down but that's it how did he ensure

440
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,290
they'd stop in places where they could

441
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,970
see monsters but not be killed but this

442
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,560
is basically a haunted elevator ride but

443
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,790
how are they moving this thing after

444
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,290
started in the grave and when the hell

445
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,150
do we get to David s pumpkins and what

446
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,470
exactly keeps this ghost behind the

447
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,560
glass again is how we die except you too

448
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,210
of course who have managed to sneak into

449
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,830
the actual facility controlling all this

450
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,180
you're going to die by completely

451
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,860
different means I'm guessing now that

452
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,180
you've infiltrated the compound and

453
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,650
broken the entire sacrificial death

454
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,300
model nice shot but this method of

455
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,010
monster storage seems way too complex

456
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,300
and impossible for any kind of

457
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,890
efficiency they put out an alert to the

458
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,270
entire building to take these two kids

459
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,010
out but this poor incompetent bastard

460
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,120
was the only one to show up at the

461
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,410
actual elevator that they are now

462
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,360
controlling Marty who is definitely dead

463
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,860
slams this guards head against the

464
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,270
elevator and the car dies immediately

465
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,310
meanwhile Marty's insides were totally

466
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,480
ripped out and he gets to walk around

467
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,250
and be alive and stuff Dana and Marty

468
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,630
have some excellent regenerative

469
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,950
abilities not only did Marty take a

470
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,510
travel to the pink back earlier tonight

471
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,520
just 9 minutes ago Dana was spewing up

472
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,700
blood whoever's voice this is seriously

473
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,230
thinks this situation is a talking-to

474
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,850
away from being contained even though

475
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,320
we've been told that Dana has to outlast

476
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,970
Marty in order for the Ancient Ones to

477
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,680
be sated these guys just start blasting

478
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
away with no caution whatsoever

479
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,290
Dana somehow knows how to work this

480
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,760
control board in order to unleash all

481
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,350
the monsters also why would you ever

482
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,790
have a control board set up where you

483
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:22,470
could unleash all the monsters this is

484
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,870
one of the best scenes of the decade

485
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,400
also this is a great shot but there's no

486
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
way that snake could have fit in that

487
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,340
elevator car requesting immediate

488
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,050
reinforcements code black

489
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,060
Truman saw Black Widow fruitlessly cock

490
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,980
her gun against nan gonna blow opponents

491
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,660
in The Avengers and was compelled to get

492
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,250
in on that sweet useless gun cocking

493
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,840
action Marty and Dana get out of the

494
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,700
control room but this is monster central

495
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,170
because the elevators keep taking

496
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,580
monsters here yet there's only a few

497
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,720
obstacles for them when they run out

498
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,370
making their escape too easy are you

499
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,340
afraid of unicorns it will be just how

500
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,590
the patients get down here does she also

501
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,970
know how to manually override the

502
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,740
elevator controls the one redeemable

503
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,940
character working at this place

504
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,160
unceremoniously dies despite the fact

505
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,330
that he was the only one who seemed to

506
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,280
have a conscience and yeah sure he blows

507
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,750
up these zombies real good but what a

508
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,220
lame ending for this character what was

509
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,780
the thought process of this monster from

510
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,340
wherever he is I'll just randomly

511
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,780
destroy the floor and hopefully I'll get

512
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,300
something to eat in the process Chi the

513
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,770
worst pronoun game is when someone is

514
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,360
dying and uses it a virgin

515
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,730
we work with what we have if we're

516
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,259
supposedly saving a bunch of demons

517
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,879
known as the ancient ones they certainly

518
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,290
would know whether or not someone's a

519
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,939
virgin right why are they so easily

520
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,100
fooled by appearances also you had two

521
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,199
girls one was a dedicated student in a

522
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,489
committed relationship and the other

523
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,199
just had an improper sexual tryst with

524
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,819
her teacher but you chose jewels to make

525
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,799
into a whore and Dena is the Virgin the

526
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,170
ancient ones the gods that used to rule

527
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,029
the earth as long as they accept our

528
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,129
sacrifice they remain below

529
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,139
yeah but make them go down there in the

530
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:45,910
first place also hasn't this one also

531
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,439
failed though considering the stoner

532
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,089
survived and both he and the Virgin made

533
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,649
their way through the compound into the

534
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,790
stone ritual room

535
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,259
this werewolf bites Dana right in the

536
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,239
jugular but she will survive this is the

537
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,980
director a supernatural being or just a

538
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,689
fatass older lady that can fairly easily

539
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,850
kick a younger man's ass redneck zombie

540
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,860
ax machina patient seems to know that

541
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,239
the director needs to be killed since

542
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,889
she bypassed Dana on the stairs because

543
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,119
she saw how much time was left in the

544
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:10,420
movie and wanted to move this belong as

545
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,339

546
