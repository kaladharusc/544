1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,030
Comcast are you kidding me with these 62

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,070
seconds of logos this bad mom's age of

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,380
Ultron or some boy I'm ami Mitchell and

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,690
I'm a mom farm splaining also narration

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,340
damn can't this movie squeeze in some

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,810
reading to give us the trifecta right at

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,369
the beginning then I shuttle the kids to

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,710
piano lessons and soccer games and dance

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,269
classes and doctor's appointments before

10
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,369
my daily trip to the grocery store daily

11
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:30,199
listen if Amy's life is this being full

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,580
of errands can't she plan ahead and get

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,260
some extra supplies I mean there are no

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,350
Costco's in the city baby here's your

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,399
project they made you what kind of

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,199
project is that exactly it's just a big

17
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,179
head of Richard Nixon make a battlefield

18
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:42,829
and stick some toy soldiers in there to

19
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,239
signify whatever war you want it to be

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,010
also come on I know she's actually a

21
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,510
great mom but she's not a professional

22
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,069
sculptor right so how'd she make this

23
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:55,039
incredibly realistic bust of Nixon kids

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,600
acting embarrassed about moms affection

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,159
in a public place cliche I don't know

26
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,260
how you do it you just leave your kids

27
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,119
all day and go to work yeah but the

28
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,889
asshole moms are also leaving their kids

29
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,810
all day too right unless they work at

30
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,789
the school and that too would make this

31
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:09,140
contradictory if you're gonna use some

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,030
intimidating tactics to make me feel bad

33
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,340
use some semblance of logic lady is this

34
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,200
your way of saying that you want to

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,000
start selling your coffee to hotels now

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,100
this is my way of saying that I want you

37
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,840
to start selling our coffee to hotels

38
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,490
now main characters boss is a douche

39
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,439
that puts upon their grudgingly willing

40
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,119
subordinate cliche you know I'm just

41
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:26,659
part-time

42
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,009
no oh I know but I have a family and

43
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,659
stuff I know most of this is to show how

44
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,219
hard Amy's working compared to these

45
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,719
millennial asshats that don't do

46
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,189
anything but why the would she be

47
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,780
part-time she's there every day this is

48
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,999
just basic business math also I thought

49
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,799
she was already running sales for

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,079
supermarkets airlines and restaurants so

51
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,030
how the hell is the term part-time even

52
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,499
possible how was work

53
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,530
oh I had two conference calls and I took

54
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,899
a nap it was exhausting Jesus Christ we

55
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,210
get it Amy's family is being awful can

56
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,439
we just get to the part where she starts

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,329
boozing and in slow-mo did you hear

58
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,509
Dylan get a D on his science quiz

59
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,249
we go bud this scene is essentially what

60
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,780
you'd see at the ninth City improv

61
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,249
troupe during their Tuesday night show

62
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:09,140
in downtown Naperville coach is posting

63
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,700
a list of

64
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,349
made the team tonight at 9:00 I'm

65
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:13,930
freaking out on an arbitrary and late

66
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,519
time to post something like this what

67
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,780
happened to the days of just posting a

68
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,430
printed list outside the cafeteria so

69
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,810
everyone could gather in a big group and

70
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,069
shun the losers who didn't make the cut

71
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,050
together do you understand how hard it

72
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,060
is to get into an Ivy League school now

73
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,310
I mean they turn away Asians that's

74
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,530
right it's a little racist damn it Amy I

75
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,550
know you're good at everything but leave

76
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,840
us sitting to meet yeah I was

77
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
masturbating online with some sherry why

78
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,340
are you doing that and why the hell

79
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,230
didn't Mike lock the door how long have

80
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,480
you been doing this oh I don't know not

81
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,110
long I get that she stays on for comedic

82
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,910
exposition but why the fuck didn't Mike

83
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,230
keep trying to close the browser window

84
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,700
or at the very least turn off the

85
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,010
monitor also Amy's gone all day and

86
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,329
apparently Mike generally works from

87
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,610
home so couldn't he do this then my

88
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,200
point is that this jerk-off has some

89
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,180
stupid jerk-off habits so much try to do

90
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,500
everything myself

91
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,760
sit hey how's n't the first 10 minutes

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,230
of this movie bit about how amy has to

93
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,849
do everything by herself every day okay

94
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,280
a little weird stay-at-home mom these

95
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,989
were just making fun of Amy for working

96
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,030
so aren't they also stay-at-home moms

97
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,349
damn it I'm sick of these arbitrary

98
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,239
insults here comes the hot widower and

99
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,220
for a supposedly subversive comedy this

100
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,200
movie is piling on the conclusion let's

101
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,970
add the hot guy first appears while

102
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,799
walking in slow motion 1 2 the heat

103
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,549
gwendolyn's been at the same spot

104
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,109
handing out flyers all morning but

105
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:27,639
specifically knocks on Amy's window in

106
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,900
order to further prove her asshole

107
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,790
titude this girl didn't see that

108
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,350
someone's now standing in her path wait

109
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,359
I realized that Amy quit the PTA but

110
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,620
where the hell are kids right now

111
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,359
did you put being a mom I guess it well

112
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,680
they're old enough to stay by themselves

113
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,630
for a while but now not long enough for

114
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,160
her to kill several bottles of scotch

115
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,690
have you trained Kiki granted I'm not a

116
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,609
super hot woman but I have boosted up

117
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,049
enough to know that it's not standard

118
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,430
practice for the bartender to bring out

119
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,989
the whole bottle when you order one

120
00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:01,049
drink having a quiet breakfast by myself

121
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,579
yes Carla so jazzed about by all

122
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,930
accounts including her own she's a

123
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,430
terrible mom who pretty much does

124
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,430
whatever she wants screw it let's be bad

125
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,799
moms roll credits also one of the many

126
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,180
problems with this movie is that they

127
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,560
had to include this line which is

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,819
completely unnecessary to get the point

129
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,410
across the hangover didn't have a moment

130
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,609
when Bradley Cooper looked at the other

131
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:19,930
two and said you know what I have the

132
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,680
hangover

133
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,970
Amy's jacket still has a bit of

134
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,200
spaghetti stain but her

135
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,490
white shirt has become a reckons Lee

136
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,140
spot-free this is really more of a

137
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,460
choking hazard than it is bad mom

138
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,230
behavior and yet another entry in this

139
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,180
movie series of cliches the protagonists

140
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,470
become fed up with their situation and

141
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,090
briefly engaged in destructive behavior

142
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,740
you can apparently buy an entire suit of

143
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,450
armor at this grocery store but even if

144
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,770
that's the case wouldn't this be like a

145
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,660
dog food bag and they would just type in

146
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,190
the UPC instead of trying to run it

147
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,000
across the scanner okay great scene and

148
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,380
all but they literally wasted hundreds

149
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,970
of dollars worth of booze alone not to

150
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,950
mention the cereal and the other so the

151
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,170
stores just gonna let that slide

152
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,000
shee I know Amy typically had running

153
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,350
smoothly in the mornings but could they

154
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,940
not look for her in a room or something

155
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,070
take your daddy's special car today

156
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,240
they really make it seem like Mike would

157
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,070
be so pissed about this but he never

158
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,720
mentions it and Amy drives it for the

159
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,760
rest of the movie

160
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,040
Jesus whenever Amy does something bad do

161
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,780
we have to see it in slow motion a sec

162
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,540
Snyder somehow involved in this movie

163
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,570
[Music]

164
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,890
Amy somehow stopped at an Arby's on the

165
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,420
way to school which was not only open

166
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,680
early in the morning but also happened

167
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
without the kids realizing it also those

168
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,590
roast beef sandwiches are gonna be

169
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,640
ice-cold by lunchtime

170
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,940
so enjoy your disgusting meal kids I

171
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,080
guess in addition to becoming bad moms

172
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
these three also decided to become just

173
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,740
generally terrible human beings when I

174
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,930
was in my 20s I would just walk down the

175
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,400
street and it would just it would just

176
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,140
be raining ducks but this performance

177
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,760
the role of rebel Wilson will be played

178
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,540
by Kathryn Hahn

179
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,420
who's watching the kids Rosie isn't it

180
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,320
your job

181
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,850
Keke's asshole husband shows up to

182
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,320
asshole for two seconds in the scene

183
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,910
only to set up a two second resolution

184
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,670
later in the movie I love these things

185
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm enjoy that she's adorable

186
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,600
thank you you can tell this is a good

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,340
father because he's hot and he's holding

188
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,230
his daughter's hand but yet he refuses

189
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,760
to even offer her a donut hole weird

190
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,640
outbursts in there terrible style this

191
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
is yet another scene to make Wendelin

192
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,970
look like a bitch but isn't Amy kind of

193
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,200
in the wrong here to be slinging a

194
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,670
single box of store-bought donut holes

195
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,350
and furthermore why she even at the bake

196
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,360
sale I thought she quit this I get that

197
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,310
Carla snuck them into the spa but they

198
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,390
would still have to have an appointment

199
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,420
for all they're doing no because I'm

200
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,820
your mom I know what you're made of did

201
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,990
anyone tell me like who knows that this

202
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,550
was a raunchy thoughtless comedy that

203
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,900
didn't require this level of acting I

204
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,310
mean she didn't even try this already

205
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,090
Jupiter ascending

206
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,890
you know I can't discuss specific

207
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,810
players with you and you know that I

208
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,210
chair the hiring and firing committee

209
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,920
right how the hell is this a thing I

210
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,690
know very little about the power of PTA

211
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,640
presidents but if it's this then that's

212
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,150
dumb I want to get laid and it should be

213
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,620
impossible for a woman that looks like

214
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,180
Mila Kunis to accomplish this without

215
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,670
external help it's my favorite are you

216
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,440
trying to get laid or adopted this

217
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,030
movie's just a series of failed sketches

218
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,170
that wouldn't have made it past dress

219
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,090
rehearsal at SNL and have you seen the

220
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,190
SNL that's on the air these days hold on

221
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,570
this was like my slutty Halloween

222
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,120
costume from college but the costume is

223
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,890
this other than a black dress man I

224
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,120
guess it's a good thing Amy kept this

225
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,980
outfit all this time and that she's the

226
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,070
exact same size she was in college oh

227
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,990
look at your mom bra we're 36 minutes in

228
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,030
we've already had at least 36 comments

229
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,559
about how unsexy amy is

230
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,759
now we have to deal with this scene

231
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,229
where she has nothing sexy enough to

232
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:25,699
wear so she can get laid when in reality

233
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,049
she could wear her work outfit from

234
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,219
earlier with the coffee and spaghetti

235
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,599
spilled all over it and she would still

236
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,549
have to turn guys away you'd make three

237
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,919
regular bras out of this one mom Brock

238
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,359
the director said maybe if we say the

239
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,889
word bra enough times people will take

240
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,879
the cue to laugh right

241
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,499
no of course this wasn't just a cheap

242
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,029
excuse to have Mila Kunis take her shirt

243
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,519
off Kenzie's never heard this it's up to

244
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,799
Street minutes of pure unadulterated top

245
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,629
look I'm sure women talk graphically

246
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,159
about penises all the time and how to

247
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,659
work them and while doing their makeup

248
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,949
in the hopes of getting their friend

249
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,229
late but wait I lost my train of thought

250
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,059
I guess I need to watch this scene again

251
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,279
hang on Carla and Kiki were just bagging

252
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,169
on Amy's wardrobe for being terrible but

253
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,759
not only did they raid her closet for

254
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,529
their outfits tonight Amy just happens

255
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:05,179
to be the exact size as both of them

256
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,009
really feels like the police should be

257
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,539
alerted to these threes criminal

258
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,889
behavior as soon as they see the slow

259
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,989
motion appear also apparently Amy's kids

260
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,489
are being yet again looked after tonight

261
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,079
if she had such a bang-up babysit her

262
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,549
support system all this time why was she

263
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:17,569
so stressed out

264
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,489
hey driving an uber is not considered

265
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,139
consent how are you I would start with

266
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,959
maybe like just got fat and Jewish so

267
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,789
the opposite of Mel Gibson I like your

268
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:26,449
wedding ring

269
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,699
I was grocery shopping and I found it on

270
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,979
the floor and I picked it up and and

271
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,599
then I put it on I'm gonna sit somewhere

272
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,979
else okay I know we're flipping the

273
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,779
script on the typical raunchy comedy but

274
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,669
do we need to completely ignore typical

275
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,240
male behavior

276
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,559
Amy could be wearing her wedding dress

277
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,939
sitting next to her husband and his

278
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,529
family have two kids attached to her in

279
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,329
slings and guys would still hit on her

280
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,949
especially if she's the one instigating

281
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,559
Kim kind of always had a thing for you

282
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,649
you knew that why why would she know

283
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,240
that as far as we can tell they've met

284
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,069
once at a bake sale you take your kids

285
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,809
to all those activities and you do all

286
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,550
those insane projects seriously how does

287
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,959
he know all these things take out the

288
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,250
comedic overtones and this could be a

289
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,740
creepy stalker Lifetime movie I saw your

290
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,120
Richard Nixon by the way that was

291
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,309
incredible dude pump the brakes I know

292
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:09,050
this is going well but it's probably a

293
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,459
little early to start talking about

294
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,050
paper mache sculptures of disgraced

295
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,939
former political figures movie cruelly

296
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,559
Skip's Amy's inevitable sexting that

297
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,480
followed Jessie's message also did they

298
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,800
have sex or what wasn't the whole point

299
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,540
of the night to get her laid I mean

300
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,189
movie spent a lot of time setting that

301
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,230
whoa there shouldn't Amy be doing this

302
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,809
in slow motion all I want to do is make

303
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,019
enough money to feed my cats and filmic

304
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:33,860
impress

305
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,270
this joke presupposes that Jay

306
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,400
J want whatever fit into a Prius how

307
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,380
dare you bench my daughter you have no

308
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,900
right to do that actually I do because

309
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,020
soccer is a PTA sponsored activity and I

310
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,300
am the president of the PTA really

311
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,860
because when you were trying to get JJ

312
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,480
to do what you wanted you used your

313
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,890
hiring and firing committee leverage

314
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,630
instead of using the power position that

315
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,670
made the most sense well yeah

316
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,080
Jada pinkett-smith has heard this line

317
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,370
so much from her husband she just

318
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,660
instinctively adds it to all of her

319
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,160
performances Gwendolen has been

320
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,930
president of the PTA for the last six

321
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,580
years let's assume that a PTA board

322
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,170
would even let someone be president for

323
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,030
six terms and that Gwendolyn spaced her

324
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,590
kids out to cover that period of time in

325
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,670
middle school where the hell are her

326
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,290
kids that they're never shown in this

327
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,690
movie she's got the attachment mom she's

328
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,420
got the tiger mom's the the sad mom she

329
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,520
has the blogging moms this goes on for

330
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,960
some time how convenient for him either

331
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,370
her feud with Gwendolyn happened right

332
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,930
as they were about to elect a new PTA

333
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,310
president would this make more sense at

334
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,630
the beginning or end of the school year

335
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,760
my kid eats butter like an entree my

336
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,690
daughter stole money from a homeless

337
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,670
woman he's escalating my kid did this

338
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,470
anecdotes are like a bag of Doritos

339
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,270
they're perfectly adequate to pass the

340
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,340
time but there's no goddamn substance so

341
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,960
where are your kids tonight out they're

342
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
staying at a friend's house I guess that

343
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,750
friend's mom isn't allowed to be bad

344
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,370
since she's likely been taking care of

345
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,830
Amy's kids for the last several days

346
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,240
okay first off it's Amy the other two

347
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,770
had all these moms cell numbers why

348
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,270
didn't she do a mass text instead of

349
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,860
handing out flyers for the campaign also

350
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,180
everyone was on their best behavior

351
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,650
during the presentation for fear of

352
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,390
reprisal from Gwendolyn but one drunken

353
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,920
picture inviting them to a booze party

354
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,540
was enough to create an entire mutiny in

355
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,280
the middle of that presentation would

356
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,860
you ladies like a jello shot ah that's

357
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,280
funny

358
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,050
but how did she make these just now at

359
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,150
Amy's house homemade jello takes at

360
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,770
least three hours to set so even though

361
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,270
Martha Stewart is magic those are some

362
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,819
bullsh jello shots

363
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,549
I swear to god I'm not slowing these

364
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,319
clips down it happens every fucking time

365
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:24,249
they act up I think that we as moms do

366
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,499
way too much stuff Amy who's been shown

367
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,239
raging on the booze for hours now

368
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,949
suddenly become sober enough to make an

369
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,779
intelligible speech for her candidacy I

370
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,949
actually may have did you off my phone

371
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,979
oh because what she wrote was disturbing

372
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,509
but you still showed up right so either

373
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,919
you're into some disturbing shit and

374
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,539
you're playing it off like you're not or

375
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,579
you're down for whatever as long as you

376
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,379
can get your wet is she seriously going

377
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,759
to counseling after having sex with

378
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,350
Jessie you the night before I mean I'm

379
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,149
all for saving a marriage but maybe give

380
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,470
a three-day buffer after you cheat on

381
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,859
your spouse

382
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:58,429
I like your spaghetti and you make

383
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,669
pretty good calzone was that three I

384
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:02,929
realized that we need to hate Amy's

385
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,549
husband so we can respect her finding

386
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:05,749
the perfect man somewhere else or

387
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,399
whatever this movie is shoving down our

388
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,869
throats but I'm pretty sure the fact

389
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,100
that he's been cheating on her for the

390
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,720
last 10 months was enough things like

391
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,129
this are just piling it on and they're

392
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,929
not even funny more interesting I think

393
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,339
you should get divorced this is

394
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,709
catastrophic okay this is played for

395
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,359
laughs but Jesus what a terrible

396
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:20,959
therapist

397
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,220
nobody was accused of criminal behavior

398
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,229
or abuse or any bullshit that would be

399
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:25,489
automatic grounds for recommending

400
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:25,850
divorce

401
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,589
I mean it's been three minutes and they

402
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,789
yelled at each other once okay I guess

403
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,019
that chapters been tied up nice and

404
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,850
clean nothing more to see here let's

405
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,899
move on to what I'm sure will be a

406
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,459
hilarious final act that will feature a

407
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,109
comeuppance a resolution to every

408
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,970
problem and even more slow motion

409
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:48,409
shenanigans the initial pitch for this

410
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,819
movie somehow made it into the script

411
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,699
you are so selfish and a frigging suck

412
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:55,309
lose day with dad tonight even he's a

413
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,350
better parent geez is anyone in this

414
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,819
movie actually likable the kids are

415
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,289
spoiled and entitled Mike's a lazy

416
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,909
asshole Amy did her office space

417
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:03,619
transition without caring about the

418
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,600
repercussions leaving JJ Watt is kind of

419
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,399
a douche bag in this movie I may have

420
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,589
just pissed off JJ Watt hmm I love your

421
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,449
sex celebration dude now we just need to

422
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:12,889
pray that Amy's little crackhead

423
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,959
daughter kids the help she needs okay

424
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,579
but wouldn't it make more sense for

425
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,139
Gwendolyn to have frame Dillon for this

426
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,059
she's already with Jane by getting her

427
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:21,589
benched on a soccer team but she's a

428
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,149
dedicated student that's hoping for the

429
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,499
Ivy League at 12 years old

430
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,879
Dillon looks like a much more likely

431
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,439
suspect than Jane to have drugs in his

432
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,870
locker Bosco

433
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,970
to a day ago Mike was considered

434
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,770
completely unfit to look after any of

435
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,630
his kids especially by himself but today

436
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,130
he's just gonna take the entire family

437
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,900
as this sad song plays after a breakup

438
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,730
in subsequent family crisis cliche plays

439
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,140
out I'm reminded that I'm essentially

440
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,150
watching every romantic comedy ever only

441
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,070
with more references to blowjobs to get

442
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,540
prepared for the scene Mila Kunis just

443
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,589
had to remember that one time that

444
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:52,150
Macaulay Culkin dragged her to see his

445
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,800
band play an entire set about Pizza

446
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,630
Wendelin you have five minutes I'll talk

447
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,100
as long as I want can we talk for a

448
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,360
second about how Wendell Pierce who

449
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,650
plays the principal gets treated in

450
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,120
movies the man was on the fucking wire

451
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,040
he's a really good actor but he's in

452
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,540
this for 10 seconds playing a powerless

453
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,160
principal right after we last saw him in

454
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,650
Twilight in Breaking Dawn Part and to

455
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,020
all the moms in school hate me what is

456
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,550
Amy basing this on just a night or two

457
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,720
ago they were all having a great time

458
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,370
together and we've seen no confrontation

459
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,850
since then

460
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,110
sure Gwendolyn was talking to the two

461
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,490
random moms to make us think otherwise

462
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,200
but Amy wasn't there for that no

463
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,810
quitting is for dads this movie is

464
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,730
addictive dad yes I can't win the

465
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,060
election oh my god this is not about the

466
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,920
election it is however about following

467
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,510
the template of the protagonist saying

468
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,350
they're definitely not gonna do

469
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,730
something right before they do no way

470
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,440
you could have sit here and let

471
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,209
Gwendolyn get away with this

472
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,770
carla has a good point regardless of

473
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,180
Amy's transformation during this movie

474
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,830
she's still been supporting her kids but

475
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,420
she didn't do jack to protest the weed

476
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,920
that was found in Jane's locker even

477
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,810
though it clearly wasn't hers get those

478
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,720
tits up get him up get him up get your

479
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,550
boobs get those tits right up I've lost

480
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,839
count of the times in which these three

481
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,250
repeats something endlessly in the hopes

482
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,570
that it'll become funny after a while

483
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,700
but here it is again and Shelby's in

484
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,120
damn it jesus H Christ man

485
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
Amy's speeding to the one place that

486
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,270
she's been the most for the last several

487
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,920
years but we need this wrong way for

488
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,589
nonsense to add to the hilarity come on

489
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,810
moving just end no seriously how good

490
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,640
did it feel because we've been given no

491
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,020
information about this relationship by

492
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,370
than the fact that the husband made Kiki

493
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,930
leave lunched at one time and that he

494
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,970
has a limp but I guess go girl

495
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,209
when it comes to being a mom I have no

496
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,440
clue what I'm doing moms love it when

497
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,089
you drop a few f-bombs during your PTA

498
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,010
speech at the middle school ha ha ha my

499
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,230
kids haven't had a bath in three weeks

500
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,940
hey remember that game we played a while

501
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,440
back comparing how awful our kids are

502
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,790
let's do that again on a bigger scale

503
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,560
gotta play the hits I guess wait did she

504
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,640
just win all she did was

505
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
make a speech and they were like seven

506
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,160
people that stood up and said something

507
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,050
did the standing ovation just count us

508
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,340
an official victory the hell are the

509
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,600
rules here give me like a second sure

510
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,580
not to immediately call my children or

511
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,810
my newfound love interest or anything

512
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,790
just to check in on my campaign right

513
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,520
[Music]

514
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,230
god damn it how many can cliches are

515
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,610
there in this movie now we have a

516
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,780
sympathetic villain at the end of the

517
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,460
movie entry and I'm telling you I can

518
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,590
not take much more of this I'm sorry for

519
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,150
acting so crazy about the whole soccer

520
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,570
thing

521
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,220
look I know children's attitudes can

522
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,930
change on a dime the last time we saw

523
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,280
these kids everything was terrible they

524
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,660
even played a sad song while Mila

525
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,100
crunched out a single tear but now

526
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,630
everything's hunky-dory

527
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,800
I guess because Amy got elected

528
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,410
president of the PTA or some both at

529
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,790
this point I'd rather be watching slo-mo

530
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,200
shots of the moms looting a grocery

531
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,730
store the company is falling apart

532
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,900

534
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,130

535
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,180

536
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,620
