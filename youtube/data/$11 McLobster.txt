the time we get two of these for a mcdonalds we got the lobster rolls

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,540
moment of truth

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,560
open to enjoy

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,000
Nick lobster all

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,650
rocky Roe mad dog rock and roll back down know that Austria are both lobster

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,130
roll

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,910
experts I was born and raised in Maine we used to have the lobster on our

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,960
license plate

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,699
this is scott fob to dock in new london connecticut home

11
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:48,030
- what is a perfect lobster roll this is lobster roll perfection

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,030
the Nick loud cool

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,379
I guess it sort of looks like Lobster this is eating the perfect lobster rule

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,080
41

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,490
bottle at it

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,490
they'll let us out

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,990
it's not that

18
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,740
but it's not good

19
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,579
it's like bouncy and drive tastes like it's straight out of the ocean

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,340
nothing else in there but lobster clean just so much larger to meet and

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,050
deliciousness cleans a good one

22
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,710
the lattice flavor is overwhelming

23
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,570
the meat is this sort of wet and a little bit mealy and it has a slightly

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,860
busier taste not to be too critical but I can taste

25
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,810
what frozen stuff that's been thought out taste like

26
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,810
that's what you're dealing with that is the mix lobster

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,850
not not even halfway through I'm even suspicious of

28
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,890
just when once you taste a little bit and you look at it and it looks a little

29
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,300
like to read

30
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,270
not like I'm even worried it's over flavor / colored I don't want to go

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,690
there

32
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,230
I have no grounds to believe it says it's a hundred percent lobster

33
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,080
one hundred percent real North Atlantic lobster on the North Atlantic what does

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,230
that mean how big is he I don't know

35
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,230
taking the finishers

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,460
nobody doesn't make for a better

37
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,460
but I'm have another bite

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,410
yeah

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,569
go I'm done I'm done

40
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,810
this is to get the perfect lobster rolls expensive was seventeen dollars with the

41
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,099
milk lobster roll

42
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,099
this is eleven dollars

43
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,640
I mean this is New England there are a hundred places he had a great lobster

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,370
roll in New England

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,370
don't , McDonald

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,730
back in Rome at da knows Rock n Roll made their nose
