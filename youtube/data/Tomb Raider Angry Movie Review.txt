[Music]

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,969
hey guys we just got back from Tomb

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,599
Raider another video game movie uh

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,320
recently here in which you know Joe well

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,439
you didn't see ready player one so early

6
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,480
but so another video game over here

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,330
looking to sort of reverse the

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,320
perception of video game movies how

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,300
they're usually bad we'll see if this

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,210
one is better than the Angelina Jolie oh

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,120
I love Angie signa Jolie man that those

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,219
were fun I mean they were dumb but they

13
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,730
were fun so but anyways well the sequel

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,390
was terrible

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,949
the first one was alright but anyway so

16
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:52,180
is this a good film you know it's

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,590
certainly a reboot of the franchise

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,780
obviously with the new actress does

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,879
anybody want to do a plot synopsis for

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:58,840
us real quick

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,899
basically Laura's father disappears for

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,750
like several years and she gets some

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,229
hints she decided to go on adventure and

24
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,960
find her father everybody believes he's

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,710
dead yeah and and she may may be rich

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,470
maybe is going to inherit this big sort

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,619
of Empire but she won't do it because in

28
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:22,600
order to sign the papers would mean that

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,060
her father is dead and she's got that at

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,979
that emotional hang up so the film

31
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,490
really has an emotional center between

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,439
the relationship between her and our

33
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,290
father and I thought this actress really

34
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,369
sells it she does a great job so as as

35
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,100
look they do sort of the video game it's

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,930
definitely not the video game storyline

37
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,670
though it looks like it I mean she's

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,290
wearing the same costume she's got the

39
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,630
same gear and so they're they're

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,610
lovingly throwing back to the more

41
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,130
recent Tomb Raider reboot not really the

42
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,310
original games but more recent stuff and

43
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,299
in that sense I think it's done well at

44
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,210
least in my opinion with with Loras you

45
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,030
can really sort of feel all of the the

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,820
tumbles and the breaking of the bones

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,000
and the rough and tough on this island

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,040
where she's trying to survive and and

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,430
this actress does a really good job

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,310
that big screen

51
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,780
yeah you don't like it it was too much

52
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,150
it was a lot okay well I'll uh I thought

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,490
it was fine and and what it did is it

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,790
really made me gravitate more towards

55
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,530
her because honestly if you're in these

56
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,300
situations you're gonna make sounds it's

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,940
not quite crowd-pleasing you know so

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,150
guys atlas for realism and I enjoyed

59
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,120
everybody a bit of it that it's sort of

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,530
like the video games and it's some kind

61
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,840
of really revel and showing you her

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,640
getting her ass kicked

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,580
which also is a loving sandbag so I like

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,100
the video game I think it was really

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
really good I rated it very highly and

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,170
it's kind of tough because this film

67
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,180
does have some problems now let these

68
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,250
guys jump in it so let me do that right

69
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,740
now so what would you think the movie in

70
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,320
general yeah it was fine it was fine

71
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,410
yeah how did you like me I think I liked

72
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,610
it more than you guys you guys are

73
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,920
looking at me with really you know

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,890
skeptical eyes I can tell that right

75
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,690
away that I like if you liked it we

76
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,120
would okay well tell me what what you

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,270
thought was wrong with it like honestly

78
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,110
I didn't believe like she was the Tomb

79
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,640
Raider she was definitely not lower

80
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,040
wrong yes she was ain't bad I don't feel

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,000
for ya you could kind of sense she's bad

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,850
she's a athletic boy the film makes a

83
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,010
point I don't know why why you guys say

84
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,360
that their film makes a point to show

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,910
her that she can kick ass already where

86
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,480
she's dead she's sparring she knows how

87
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,950
to fight at the beginning of the film

88
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,740
she didn't get her ass handed to her it

89
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,720
was a close fight and she got choked out

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,870
and the problem realism realism

91
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,209
now I'll agree with you that you know

92
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,610
this film is a to less than two hour

93
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,920
film in the video game me and Joe played

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,930
it nothing is like more than nine hours

95
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,880
and you really go on this journey and

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,820
you see your transform and you see every

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,700
moment you are hunting with Laura Croft

98
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,960
to survive and and try to try to jam

99
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,150
a ten-hour kind of journey into two

100
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,410
hours this is a good way to do it though

101
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,449
they could have done a better job of

102
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,910
setting up her prior experience they

103
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,349
kind of touched on it here and there oh

104
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,940
she's good with bow and arrows because

105
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,360
she's a rich kid and and yeah she's good

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,590
at puzzles but they don't really show

107
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,020
why ya know she's just really good at

108
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,750
puzzles good at archery and good at you

109
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,099
know fighting but not the best at

110
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,620
fighting and then they set her up like

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,539
that

112
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,650
during the flight the coaches I hate

113
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,270
don't punch her

114
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,820
that's not your strong point years ago

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,729
thanks so she has no strong point of

116
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,419
punching she's sure yeah and that fits

117
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,310
perfectly into the film because she's

118
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,620
not punching people the whole film she's

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,349
actually doing like you know the the

120
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,330
scissor kick and choking people loud and

121
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,880
and yeah so that actually fits perfectly

122
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
in that that was so there's gonna be a

123
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,940
weird review because it seems like I

124
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,830
like the film a lot you guys didn't make

125
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,479
it because she wasn't athletic and I

126
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,650
didn't think at all that she wasn't

127
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,330
athletic I think that she wasn't two

128
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,009
murders she was it was dad fighting what

129
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,259
makes two what makes look because in my

130
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,620
opinion this is the transformation of

131
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,229
her you know getting interested in tomb

132
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:47,909
raiding discovering skills is what to me

133
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,500
she was yeah she was there for a

134
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,849
specific reason which is honorable it's

135
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:51,930
like if this has been called like dad

136
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,310
finder like dad funny that's what's

137
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,479
great cuz that's what she was there for

138
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,130
she didn't care about she didn't believe

139
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,570
in any of this stuff she didn't care

140
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,430
about it she didn't take she was

141
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,990
skeptical she's supposed to be a vessel

142
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,520
for the audience to be skeptical about

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
this because her father believes and

144
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,240
needs them these magical items these

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,520
artifacts that could spread and do this

146
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,009
thing and all these things and and a

147
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,320
shadowy organization they did you learn

148
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,900
about and we'll talk about a little bit

149
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,599
of that stuff in spoilers but I disagree

150
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,610
I thought it was well done I think that

151
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,490
this is Laura Croft Joe at the beginning

152
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,780
is like this is Laura Krupp they got it

153
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,520
right now you're telling me that this is

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,969
my guy

155
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,389
right great bucket I just she needed to

156
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,639
have more knowledge of what she was

157
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,469
doing interest she showed no interest

158
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:39,610
even at the end of the movie there was

159
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,929
nothing where she was interested in

160
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:44,259
further missions or anything that they

161
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,299
said yeah they did they beat it into the

162
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,739
audience head that there's gonna be a

163
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,509
sequel there's gonna be sequels for sure

164
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,039
but not that she was interested in the

165
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,229
arc y'all like the archaeology aspect

166
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,999
and that's who she okay yeah you're

167
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,509
right I could totally see that aspect

168
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,319
100% with these guys

169
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,389
this particular Laura isn't as

170
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,259
interested in the subject matter she was

171
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,839
there for her father and that's what

172
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,029
gave the film the emotional resonance

173
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,939
for me and and that was a good film in

174
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,949
that respect and that's why I think it's

175
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,149
a great film and one that helps the

176
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:20,769
video game movies it's not a terrible

177
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:27,729
movie recently is it an average film I

178
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,610
say above yeah it's above average this

179
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,669
is this is the the action scenes are

180
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,639
good the cinematography is great the

181
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,769
situations that they put her in there's

182
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,959
tension you're at the edge of your seat

183
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,489
or like she's gonna make it through this

184
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:44,439
and since it's not exactly the video

185
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,360
game store line there's some different

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,309
things in there then you can tell that

187
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:49,929
it's sort of a homage to what's in the

188
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,599
video game so I thought it was great um

189
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,849
you know I will agree that there is a

190
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,029
little under development of Laura's

191
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,349
backstory like how is she such a good

192
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,149
fighter they and they tried to do that

193
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,769
and they try to do it in wrong ways

194
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,829
there's an entire sequence of her riding

195
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,979
a bike really fast and doing a

196
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,079
competition like a new person you do

197
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,849
nothing about it you someone just took

198
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,610
you you don't know how she knows those

199
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,769
skills right right yeah and they could

200
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:22,749
have done more of that and maybe some

201
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,659
parts got cut where you see Laura as a

202
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,209
younger girl getting more phytic

203
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,399
training getting more puzzle solving

204
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,289
experience just because her father left

205
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,300
a bunch of puzzles around the house it

206
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,430
doesn't really mean automatically that

207
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,829
you're the best puzzle solver now if you

208
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:40,839
show us that she's a puzzle solver or

209
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,750
you tell us or whatever but they didn't

210
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,180
really

211
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,860
either she just starts solving puzzles

212
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,860
and you're like oh okay cool the house

213
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,070
yeah but once you get into sort of the

214
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,050
tomb and they actually do raided tomb in

215
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,470
here so that's good tomb raider you know

216
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,060
there are some interesting puzzles in

217
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,550
there and my my main concern going in

218
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,960
the film was that you know the traps are

219
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,370
gonna be too fakie and there's too much

220
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,590
CGI and that's the impression that the

221
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,780
trailer gives but actually the film does

222
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,450
have a lot of realness to it realness in

223
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,030
the fighting the dirt the grime the

224
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,380
pushing through better uh great odds to

225
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,290
make this girl a hero and yes he's not

226
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,980
the Laura Croft that we know from the

227
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,840
video games I think the video game is

228
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,940
far superior of course it had four or

229
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,040
five times longer to develop the

230
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,500
character but this is a shortened

231
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,370
version of that is 100% satisfactory if

232
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,200
you go and see this film I think you're

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,350
gonna enjoy it as a sort of popcorn you

234
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,220
know action flick so so yeah what was

235
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,410
what else was weaker in the sense that

236
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,760
you didn't there was a lot of things

237
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
that were completely like a lot of

238
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,590
Indiana Jones style films where there's

239
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,750
you know ancient traps from thousands of

240
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,470
years ago yeah yeah that just don't make

241
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,260
any goddamn sense know that he's wrong

242
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,840
the color test okay well I will agree

243
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,580
that the technology is quite impressive

244
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,490
for this tomb is absolutely ridiculous

245
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,930
you know stuff that to excuse because

246
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,510
you want a lab rat traps I do want to

247
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,430
advertise and some of the traps are what

248
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,400
the other ones were pretty good but okay

249
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,070
but okay so I will say this that I agree

250
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,590
another thing is that so Laura's a

251
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,580
little underdeveloped her her her prior

252
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,680
history right but during this film do

253
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,660
you think that you feel that she went

254
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,400
through a transformation she has a

255
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,770
character arc and and you enjoyed going

256
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,680
on the journey with her I don't know if

257
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,260
she's like developed much as a character

258
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,600
mm-hmm yeah and the videogame you feel

259
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,520
like she had done a huge transformation

260
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,400
on the island here you think yes she's

261
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,410
definitely tougher but it wasn't that

262
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,720
magnitude of transformation she

263
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,399
was already kind of tough and now she's

264
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,740
tougher they do throw in the scene in

265
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,540
the trailer at the end with the guns you

266
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,269
know her patented guns that felt totally

267
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,490
tacked on you only tacked on there yeah

268
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,110
because she doesn't use the guns or

269
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,490
anything like that in the film she's

270
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,500
using the bow and arrows the stuff that

271
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,740
we know and they do have some twists on

272
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,649
you know who appears in the film which I

273
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,259
think made it interesting you think it

274
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,120
made it less interesting but I don't

275
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,379
know how that happens we'll talk about

276
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,959
that in spoilers and they also have a

277
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,509
supporting character floor Laura this

278
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,850
sort of cap boat captain Jonathan was a

279
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,839
great character

280
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,339
you know he's searching for sort of the

281
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,790
same thing that she is and they end up

282
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,759
forming a friendship on the island so I

283
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,500
think it was cool I I thought it was a

284
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,240
satisfactory thing now the thing that it

285
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,040
did lack and will go to final word

286
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,500
acceptor this is I think it could have

287
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,139
been more fun a little bit more they

288
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,240
really took it serious and this is the

289
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,790
result of taking a more realistic

290
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,680
approach on Tomb Raider just like the

291
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,540
video game reboot did this route boot

292
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,430
takes a more serious approach there's

293
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,620
really no lore doesn't have any fun

294
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,750
she's not smiling this is not a time to

295
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,899
smile have fun make jokes there's none

296
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,600
of that in here and I wish it was just a

297
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,430
little bit more playful and I think they

298
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,930
tried to do some of that at the end

299
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,759
which is why it felt like a different

300
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,589
movie or tacked on there like here

301
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,629
sequel is coming don't worry you know

302
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:23,959
kind of thing but yeah and and it may

303
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,579
have been out of place in inappropriate

304
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,930
so this was I think I enjoyed it so much

305
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,970
because in this self-contained story

306
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,519
it was a Cliff Notes version of the

307
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,250
video game in a satisfactory way with

308
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,670
different story notes right okay so

309
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,920
final verdict and a little bit more

310
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
thoughts if you if you wanted to add any

311
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,959
let's start with father Joe first well

312
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,180
for my thoughts I really elaborate more

313
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,389
in the spoilers but overall I really

314
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,629
liked the characters I believe Maura was

315
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,350
a great choice Alicia

316
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,620
she was spot-on sporting cast did their

317
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,889
job but I just the story wasn't enough

318
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,550
for me I'm sorry okay that's fine you're

319
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,959
entitled to your opinion so you know

320
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,649
I've got like from my life yeah I'm

321
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:16,730
gonna give this a 6

322
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,269
there's above-average six slightly above

323
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,750
average

324
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:29,120
you remember my scale Oh me my turn so I

325
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,649
thought the storytelling was it was

326
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,199
definitely week one a more backstory I

327
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:34,399
didn't like some of the directions they

328
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,970
chose they fell into the same traps that

329
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,769
a lot of the other adventure movies

330
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,379
where I'm supposed to believe that

331
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,480
people who had were using bows and

332
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,290
arrows and samurai swords develop these

333
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,069
tribes Aborigine yet create technologies

334
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,560
as years ridiculous

335
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,639
and then like you said it was like

336
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,769
unrelenting that she just is getting

337
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,839
beat up and pummeled this entire and

338
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,850
literally beat up and then pummeled and

339
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,720
then thrown off of everything and she's

340
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,009
you don't really happens in the video

341
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,589
game yeah but I mean so you don't it's a

342
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:13,550
different medium you're not I'm not

343
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,920
going to watch some girl get beat up and

344
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,389
have her squeak like seriously she

345
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,250
squealed probably like 50 60 times

346
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:25,399
there's gonna be you shoes that's that's

347
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,759
the way it would be if you're in those

348
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,480
situations and that's a life there

349
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,529
wouldn't be any of that because I have

350
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,059
been dead okay but would have been I

351
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,829
would have used logic well I don't know

352
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:38,059
anything about this I don't know where

353
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,529
the fuck I'm going yeah there's a little

354
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,100
man okay so you think I sign that no

355
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,870
yeah that's cool okay oh you're right

356
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,399
Joe they should have showed more scenes

357
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,170
of Laura trying to escape the island

358
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,930
just this my dad fuck all this stuff I

359
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,579
don't care about nothing I want to go

360
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,290
home is would that make you better would

361
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,870
that make it better

362
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,260
I just you know it's there was a lot of

363
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,690
failures and they wanted to show a lot

364
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,160
to talk a lot about spoilers okay I

365
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,900
wasn't I wasn't thrilled with the story

366
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,700
I think story was average like five at

367
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,260
like five out of ten storytelling at

368
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,790
best I actually was really good and I

369
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,800
think it was I wouldn't say it's a fun

370
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,240
movie but the action scenes were you

371
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,660
know like worth watching yeah I mean I

372
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,250
this not is not an average film so I

373
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,750
will give it a 6 but it's a pretty low

374
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,480
six okay you want a moral I wanted more

375
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,490
two Raiders you want to you want more

376
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,550
rating of the tools you're the whole

377
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,620
film to being a tool well maybe we'll

378
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,000
get that next one all right but they

379
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,100
gotta set up near you the video game

380
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,720
wasn't in a tomb and you like that's

381
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,480
right there was actually not a whole lot

382
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,430
of tombs in the video game and that's

383
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,080
why there's not a whole lot of tombs in

384
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,820
this one cuz you're gonna get some of

385
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,100
that stuff in the future all right I

386
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,450
don't know why these two are being

387
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,910
sourpusses about Tomb Raider and it may

388
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,560
be that their opinions are probably the

389
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,510
opinions of the general public but I

390
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,790
probably because I really enjoyed the

391
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,620
video game I noticed a lot of the

392
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,459
throwbacks

393
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,459
and I felt it was a good development in

394
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,160
a shorter span of time for her character

395
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,709
they did have obvious weaknesses they

396
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,390
should have set up more a little bit

397
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,150
better to explain how she's so

398
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,670
proficient and in some of this or really

399
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,100
focus in on that instead of these stupid

400
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,250
oh no I'm an uber goober eats driver on

401
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,990
a bike and I'm putting pain everywhere

402
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,690
get that out of the film and focus more

403
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,500
on her development on the island to

404
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,410
become a badass give us a montage if you

405
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,020
need to you know a ramble more time I

406
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,209
don't care but so there was a little

407
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,089
that and and I guess you guys are right

408
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,250
their story is it's not something that

409
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,350
we've never seen before so if you've

410
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,850
watched a lot of sort of the Indiana

411
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,709
Jones and the adventure films and these

412
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,279
these these tomb explorations notice a

413
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,440
lot of the same things but like they

414
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,450
said the action is done well it's filmed

415
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,779
well and the actual actress for earns

416
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,150
the Apsaras Laura I wish she was a

417
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,709
little more fun and I think that's why

418
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,360
they sort of tacked on some fun miss at

419
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,420
the end which felt a little out of place

420
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,829
and saying we will

421
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,870
to that but this film has to do well

422
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,230
first so as a gamer as somebody who

423
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,819
likes Tomb Raider I thought they did it

424
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,529
justice and I think you should go out

425
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,380
and see it that's why I am going to race

426
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,470
it so yes weight was six it is it's

427
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,289
definitely bare minimum of seven but I

428
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,740
think that I'm gonna give it a name I'm

429
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,100
going with an eight because it might be

430
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,720
the nostalgia person played all the damn

431
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,570
games and this is a better film in a

432
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,490
different way from the Angelina Jolie's

433
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,010
those are more fun but dumb and these

434
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,500
were more realize don't action you were

435
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,230
getting right yeah so and and that does

436
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,049
hold this film back and in some ways

437
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,039
when you're going to more realistic

438
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,360
route then you're you guys are

439
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,700
questioning well how is she doing that

440
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,100
why is she pointing a bow and arrow I

441
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,590
had a hell of an armored helican you

442
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,929
know these kinds of things so it's a

443
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,220
little bit of mix and that's why it

444
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,110
could be a seven or an eight so alright

445
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,820
we're gonna talk about all the spoilers

446
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,269
oh I'm gonna go in eight because I was

447
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,950
thirsty

448
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,679
that's why is the two point disconnect

449
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,179
and that's why we were arguing a lot in

450
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,070
this review so anyway see it for

451
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,639
yourself

452
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,860
I do think that you should I would give

453
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,779
it a recommendation these guys would you

454
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,789

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,840
all right welcome to the spoiler section

464
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,820
we'll let these guys sort of beat up on

465
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,040
the film cuz I know legit Japanese light

466
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,310
puzzle trap she said it so a matter of

467
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,860
like oh it's the ancient Japanese light

468
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,750
trap I need it line up these magic

469
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,160
crystals in a cave that doesn't have a

470
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,760
normal light source yeah yeah so the

471
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,560
traps were really fucking elaborate but

472
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,840
in in in my and dumb

473
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,420
no the traps were cool in my world if

474
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,060
the rest of the film sets everything up

475
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,010
and the traps are a little bit over the

476
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,100
top I'll excuse something yeah it's

477
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,840
we're talking about spikes coming out of

478
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,190
the ground and we're not talking about

479
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,120
fucking lasers and fucking teleportation

480
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,010
we're talking about here there had to be

481
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,810
light specifically shining through this

482
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,000
tiny hole that out of an out of a rock

483
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,100
that slid in place in a cave where there

484
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,020
was no light none whatsoever

485
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,370
and there had to be light shining

486
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,740
through it and she had a she was putting

487
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,710
a flashlight on it yeah how did they

488
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,540
know that it was a light trap then and

489
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,830
where was she where was the the light

490
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,070
going was there like a sense exactly

491
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,760
grief some of the traps are like way

492
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,450
really

493
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,470
wow that's pretty elaborate she did what

494
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,760
I would have done fucking try all of

495
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,390
them all of the things I know she's the

496
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,040
best puzzle solver but then at the same

497
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,720
time you're also saying well this films

498
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,950
realistic cuz she would have done what I

499
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,360
would have done with just try all of

500
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,830
them well which one is it

501
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,020
they're hating the fifth no for no damn

502
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,970
reason I but here is a reason to to hate

503
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,220
on it they they sort of beat you over

504
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,010
the head with the horse is this this

505
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,620
lady's evil is it maybe evil and then at

506
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,010
the end she was evil fuck son good job

507
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,720
but it wasn't just like Oh two minutes

508
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,700
realizing oh all the companies they're

509
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,650
owned because she finally signs the

510
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,510
papers different power of attorney to

511
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,820
the bad person but she ends up fucking

512
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,290
up and giving power of attorney to the

513
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,630
old lady and she was evil the whole time

514
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,110
and they do this flashback

515
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,720
for five minutes in my short solid

516
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,390
minutes they go well now that yeah and

517
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,740
that's okay I get it and they're like no

518
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,539
no but you manage evil it's like yeah I

519
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,820
got that you said that the photographs

520
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,679
so that's gonna photograph stuff like

521
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,480
that the back side is this old lady but

522
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,299
legend so it was that were setting up

523
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,100
the Trinity which is this evil

524
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,059
organization that now is intrinsically

525
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,649
tied to the Crofts

526
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,929
and she's got a job to do to take out

527
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:34,809
Trinity the Trinity the first one so so

528
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,940
that's why there's a little beaten and

529
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,039
then tacked on there and at the end but

530
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,929
I enjoyed the film so I was like yeah

531
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:43,149
alright let's see another one with with

532
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:46,720
her in there and more tombs for Joe more

533
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,059
explanations of her badass and what for

534
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,929
you I don't know no story yeah a better

535
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:56,200
story okay yeah and let's see what else

536
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,659
so her father is presumed dead this

537
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:00,820
whole time and I didn't think that he

538
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,950
would die and I'm kind of I've seen so

539
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,659
many movies as like oh the father is

540
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,669
dead and and you just have to come to a

541
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,769
realization and really you know just do

542
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,539
this but no the father is actually alive

543
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,909
and he's been on this island surviving

544
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,669
and and and basically booby-trapping and

545
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,710
distracting these people who are trying

546
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,309
to get at this this ancient tomb that

547
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,059
has a great power and or whatever that

548
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:26,679
actually is kind of not explained right

549
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,880
why would they have to this tomb what

550
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,840
were they gonna do with this old

551
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,970
mummified you know they're gonna use it

552
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,700
under these ladies kill people but did

553
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,789
they know that if they didn't believe in

554
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,230
the hocus-pocus

555
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,090
I guess the Trinity believed in the

556
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,220
Hocus business okay guys get these all

557
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,500
good but no less supernatural right but

558
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,909
that's why nobody on the island gave a

559
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,440
shit because they're all mercenaries and

560
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,850
they want to open the tomb they don't

561
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,159
care if it be source it's something that

562
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,990
can like end the world why did they send

563
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,169
like seven dudes well maybe they weren't

564
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,580
sure and they had like I don't know 15

565
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,610
15 yes or 7 years and it was just an arc

566
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:09,460
a lot he died 500 people on the island

567
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,049
I mean eventually you're gonna turn this

568
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,000
into not even a movie she's gonna get on

569
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,960
the items credits roll and then and now

570
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,010
he's happy

571
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,320
sure thrilled that the dad was alive

572
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,450
living like Gilligan's Island in this

573
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,220
cage like he's in this cave I've always

574
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,440
supplies and he's like hanging out and

575
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,330
he's like the island version of Kevin

576
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,250
McHale strings like leaving like little

577
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,899
traps everywhere that was great because

578
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:36,880
and then he didn't believe his daughter

579
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,250
so he runs from his daughter by the way

580
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,380
she kicks the fucking shit out of this

581
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,210
mercenary tracker I love that scene

582
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,130
that's visceral that's like a woman

583
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,350
going up against and they do it well

584
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,179
enough to where you believe it that yes

585
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,000
she can overpower him and and and

586
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,890
members she murders him and kills him

587
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,690
and it's an emotional scene and she

588
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,760
realize what she just did and she had no

589
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,700
choice these are the emotional moments

590
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,260
in the film that brings that up to an

591
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,850
eight for me but anyway but it ends

592
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,350
immediately because I think your Caesar

593
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,240
runs off she runs after the figure and

594
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,350
then he goes up a wall and takes the

595
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,610
road with him and then she's like no

596
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,380
fuck this cuz I think it's my dad I

597
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,330
could have swore with my dad and she

598
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,279
follows him I love the scenes like she's

599
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:18,730
not here

600
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,250
doesn't hurt that's not yeah you know go

601
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,020
away and then she's talking to him and

602
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,779
doing that really God go away because I

603
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:27,460
miss Eileen probably sees his daughter

604
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,960
there all the time so I thought that was

605
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
handled really well and I was like oh

606
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,500
great you know cool we have this other

607
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,419
new aspect that she can go on this

608
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,010
journey with the father this last

609
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,789
adventure

610
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,830
were they bond and and it's used

611
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,289
effectively in the story forcing her to

612
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,710
open this tomb by you know threatening

613
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,419
his life and she went all this way to

614
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,460
save them and you say that's her only

615
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,350
motivation so of course she's gonna be

616
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,240
the hope that one to open the tomb but

617
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,899
the dad had no reason to be by the door

618
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:58,179
well yes he did he's trying to protect

619
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:00,820
the tomb from these guys

620
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,450
so he's was leading there to protect the

621
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,029
tono at the very end he stands right

622
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:10,330
next to his I go open it oh you mean

623
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,880
because he was curious if you're an

624
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,679
archaeologist and you've been doing

625
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,779
seven years protecting this tomb when

626
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:18,549
they finally reveal it you want to be

627
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:19,270
like bones

628
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,419
okay you don't you don't walk over there

629
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,419
and be like oh and then a gun to your

630
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:28,600
head open it open it oh shit fucked up

631
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,610
okay I see what you're saying seven

632
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,080
years I've been staying away from this

633
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:40,630
nobody this shit was shit was fucked up

634
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,380
by then

635
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,740
oh yeah but it's so easy you guys are

636
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,470

got the fucking oh yeah winner or medal

639
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,340
well I am I respected the fact that you

640
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,140

641
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,690
through trees it's like oh they hit you

642

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,570
I believe that all right yeah yeah but

653
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,159
she didn't do that she won't lift around

654
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,710
cuz she didn't know how to deal with you

655
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:51,039
one square on the sides so what else the

656
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,409
weakened spoil so the tomb is this

657
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:58,899
ancient Japanese sort of lady who in

658
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:02,049
tombs herself because she carries some

659
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:04,659
kind of new disease that almost turns

660
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:06,429
people into zombie she's it was like a

661
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,080
zombie it's a zombie virus it is a

662
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,880
zombie virus she's a carrier of a zombie

663
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,529
virus she's immune to it but other

664
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,210
people around her died so she in tombs

665
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,440
herself with a thousand of her

666
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,899
handmaidens or whatever and they come to

667
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:18,399
this realization and they touch the

668
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,260
zombie and not all of them are

669
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,100
susceptible to this virus I know all

670
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,840
okay he wasn't it's just two guys we're

671
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,960
touching it and only one guy turned into

672
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,640
your hand oh so he turned into his arm

673
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,530
when you get turned in then you get

674
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,940
aggressive so they shot him down I

675
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,320
thought that was kind of why did she

676
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,690
jack-in-the-box out of the coffin sure

677
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,670
it was smoke and mirrors they wanted

678
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,320
people to stay away from the fuckin

679
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,650
things so they purposely like sits up

680
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,110
for no reason and then it like wines

681
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,990
itself back down you're trying to play

682
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,059
with your mind and oh is this thing real

683
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,510
or not and that's that's why by building

684
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,750
that Rapson in there I chose a trap like

685
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,740
you touch it touch it then there's Joe's

686
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,750
right Joe's right it okay your dad so

687
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,610
you know you don't get out with the

688
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,490
virus anyways to clip her fucking finger

689
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,190
and even this guy knows now this is a

690
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,750
biological weapon I could sell it for a

691
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,250
lot of money he's gonna try to get out

692
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,200
and we have this great fight scene at

693
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,030
the end where she's just like there's a

694
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,309
ladder because there's a huge chasm and

695
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,410
there's a ladder and she promised her

696
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,080
father who just got infected and it said

697
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,790
I'm gonna blow everything up go daughter

698
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,250
they have a nice scene and then he's

699
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,140
like promise me you'll stop him and so

700
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,270
she gets to him and she's not really

701
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,740
sure she's gonna stop him so she just

702
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,809
fucking kicks the ladder so I made a

703
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,970
promise and it's like people promises

704
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,220
let's do it broke a lot wait man you

705
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,860
motherfuckers what promise did she break

706
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,679
the whole the whole mission Heyburn

707
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,960
promise been burning and instead they

708
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,820
steal the scene from Indiana Jones Last

709
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,240
Crusade

710
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,460
there's no fucking movie if she burned

711
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,220
the files gel she made up so her father

712
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,820
left all the files the original doctor

713
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,630
tomorrow

714
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,350
the God Journal okay so dad has been

715
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,480
missing for seven years she finds all

716
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,840
the clues says play me that battery life

717
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,350
has to be amazing yeah seven years we

718
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,200
can barely keep this camera on like five

719
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,010
hours and label this section nitpicks

720
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,380
instead of spoilers okay because now

721
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,880
these are things in every film you know

722
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,110
now you're just pointing out there's a

723
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,420
lot of them in this one just to hate

724
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,700
I understand this is a good video game

725
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,670
film and you two guys are making it seem

726
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,380
like it's a shit this isn't above

727
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,220
average

728
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,310
this is above but this is not a good

729
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,100
film yeah it is it is a good film

730
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,470
comparing it's not a great film no but

731
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,560
it's not the best tomb raiding type of

732
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,560
film it's not Raiders of the Lost Ark

733
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,860
but that's a 10 and this is a 7 or an 8

734
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,710
but you guys I don't know I think you're

735
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,720
actually you're giving is what but maybe

736
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,430
just didn't enjoy it as much that's I

737
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,990
mean I just before you're comparing its

738
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,910
Raiders of Lost Ark like this is a solid

739
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,980
6 where that's a 10 like there's so many

740
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,900
diffic there's a lot of differences

741
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,180
between the two yes I like series oh

742
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,440
that's them like really silly things

743
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,760
were like wait a minute why is there a

744
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,230
million snakes down there first I'm sure

745
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,640
you could fuck and those snakes are

746
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,290
still alive like how like there's some

747
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,060
really stupid things there's years you

748
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,190
could do the same fuckin you can but the

749
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,380
difference is the story of that movie it

750
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,080
was great yeah and this one I'll give it

751
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,910
to you fine yeah I'll give it to you

752
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,640
yeah it's probably a seven after here on

753
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,620
that argument and real life trying to

754
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,720
try to compare it to the greatest tomb

755
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,640
raiding film of all time yeah it looks

756
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,190
worse by comparison but I was comparing

757
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,740
it to other tomb raider movies home

758
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,510
which is a little bit easier bar to

759
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,200
Christian Plus okay then see and plus

760
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,180
the video games well it's not as good as

761
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,550
the first video game Tomb Raider it does

762
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,650
a good job at condensing the story with

763
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,230
some flaws and some issues so we said

764
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,510
that all of it for you any any anybody

765
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,100
want to chime in with anything we forgot

766
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,960
oh they also throw in at this pawn shop

767
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,140
thing the weird humor injection that

768
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,280
like made no sense

769
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,350
mmm-hmm well we already touched on that

770
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,330
but but I thought that that was gonna

771
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,640
play more into the film they kind of

772
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,470
bait-and-switch you in the trailers with

773
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,030
this pawn shop guy though he's gonna be

774
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,310
like her heart like when she shows it

775
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,440
there so we know we talking about

776
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,760
spoilers but she just needed money

777
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,130
that's why but she has a billion dollars

778
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,810
waiting for but she's broke because she

779
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,370
won't sign this thing because her

780
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,320
father's do yeah well no it doesn't mean

781
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,060
if his father's dead like in like I

782
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,580
guess TV except she doesn't want to

783
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,260
accept it so she refuses to sign his

784
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,820
death certificate and then getting all

785
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,730
this money so she

786
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,620
live destitute sell something that means

787
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,049
in a ton are only like thing from her

788
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,640
father that was her mother's she'd

789
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
rather sell that than just signed the

790
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,179
death certificate yeah anybody in it

791
00:31:58,179 --> 00:31:59,770
nobody would do things yeah but so why

792
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,410
like why have that to inject some humor

793
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,240
to like I mean I love he's me so I see

794
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,370
what you're saying yeah if but if they

795
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,320
didn't do that if they already made it

796
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,520
like she's super interested in

797
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,799
archeology herself she already has a ton

798
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,250
of money

799
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,200
she doesn't know where her father went

800
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,650
she finds a secret room in the ger in

801
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,370
her father's grave room and and then he

802
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,360
says this is what I was researching

803
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,460
burned my research so so you that would

804
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,840
have been a better film than that

805
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,000
actually would have been the video game

806
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,440
so they tried to do something else

807
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,299
you've gone and they actually kind of

808
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,120
you know it's none necessary it's been

809
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,490
for 15 years in the suppressed Tomb

810
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,950
Raider you could duplicate the story a

811
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,960
little bit more I know you feel maybe

812
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,720
you don't want to tread that so many

813
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,429
freaking times because honestly there's

814
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:56,320
been a lot of tread on that but only if

815
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,970
you played all the games and I don't

816
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,730
think the jet mater mass movie-going

817
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,100
audience has treaded the blood crop

818
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,040
thing too much except for with Angelina

819
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,160
a long time ago anyways so I enjoyed

820
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,900
this one a little more than them it is

821
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,150
admitted we moved flaw seven eight

822
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,500
that's a solid six is over here but yeah

823
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,600
four but it's not the worst video game

824
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
movie and I do think ready player one is

825
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,799
is better if you want to save your money

826
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,440
for that one then then be so do so and

827
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,070
you'll do fine

828
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,809

worst like strip like actual video games

852
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,659
so I mean like ready player one is

853
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,220
inspired by a lot of video games but

854
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,740
like the best video game movie for me

855
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,349
it's Mortal Kombat if you're talking

856
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,889
straight-up

857
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:44,800
born from a video game not in it not

858
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,659
like ready player one or not like

859
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,550
wreckit-ralph cuz Rick and Ralph and

860
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,080

00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,550
a little bit better ready player ones up

862
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,820
there and I'm probably missing some

863
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,880
Resident Evil probably thinking I guess

864
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,770
Riddick known that was a video game best

865
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,690
video game based on a movie licensed

866
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,020
well you can't go backwards like that so

867
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,270
yeah for me it's Mortal Kombat so put

868
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,730
