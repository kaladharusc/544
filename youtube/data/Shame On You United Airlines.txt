family off at the airport i socio with

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,140
them but we decided last minute that me

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,420
spending five days of the in-laws would

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,050
probably be a terrible idea not a big

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,460
fan of using your blinker are you

10

Candace and the baby are out of town but

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,700
go ahead and take advantage of this free

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
time by going for a very serious run

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,770

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,010
fell apart that is 21 miles an easy 816

39
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,620
days I got back from the run and that's

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,790
when I was like going to shoot an

41
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,530
episode and do everything else get my

42
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,690
day started but I took one of those

43
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,340
showers you just got to stand there and

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,680
fall asleep standing up and then I

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,480
thought why not just lie down for a

46
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,920
second I haven't slept more than four

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,130
hours unless we pass out still light out

48
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,530
passed out and I just slept yeah so like

49
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,980
six in this morning that's why that's

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,620
why I miss an episode yesterday nah cuz

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,090
I was taking time off with the family

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,850
like I said but because I went for an

53
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,799
irresponsibly long run and then passed

54
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:01,220
out and then slept like 14 hours like a

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,310
hibernating grizzly bear and then Here I

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,680

00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,610

60
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,890

61
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,239

Marlatt like that

66
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,560
maybe it's one getting old you know

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,060
people in the comments keep reminding

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,500
about how old I am

69
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,230
here's the thing about old when people

70
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,580
make fun of you and they tell you that

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,050
you're you're stupid

72
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,030
you cannot anonymous smart and then when

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,680
people like call you ugly things like

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,269
not on my mom says I'm super handsome

75
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,110
but when people tell you your old old is

76
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,519
objective old is a number that you

77
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,650
cannot hide from I am old I'm 36 yet I

78
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,120
guess that means that after a solid

79
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,940
Sunday afternoon run that I just can't

80
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,530

81
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:11,590
have to sleep for 14 hours all right

82
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,920

sure you saw it in the news but

108
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,540
yesterday there was this video of a guy

109
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,900
being ejected off the United flight four

110
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,090
they overbooked the flight they didn't

111
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,680
have a sefer and asked them to leave

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,570
he refused they dragged him off the

113

plane

114
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,639
whatever anything like that happens I

115
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,260
always actually thought what would I do

116
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,540
in that situation especially today when

117
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,030
