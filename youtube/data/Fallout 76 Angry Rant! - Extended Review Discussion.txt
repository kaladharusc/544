radio silence forever on pretty much

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,420
acknowledging a little bit in their PR

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,230
way the disaster that is fallout 76 of

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,810

11

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,340
the upcoming patches we're eager to get

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,159
improvements into Fallout 76 as soon as

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,369
we can why wasn't it there from the

27
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,890
beginning it we have all all these

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,770
discussed extended discussion and

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,990
questions that will go after we look

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,479
through these patches together so here

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,860
let's take a look at what's coming up

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,439
over the next few weeks December 4 I

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,450
just want to say none of this matters it

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,670
doesn't matter I'm done I'm done with

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,979
fallout 76 now it's great for people

36
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,079
that maybe are considering purchasing it

37
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,119
in the future which I probably wouldn't

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,060
recommend you do until February until

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,689
it's like 20 bucks it's down right so

40
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,520
util goes free-to-play

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,229
that's something another thing I wanted

42
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,969
to discuss free-to-play but I'm saying

43
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,460
it doesn't matter because guess what

44
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,200
millions of players have already played

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
the game and I and they're pretty much

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,770
done with it at this point because there

47
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,439
is no endgame there's nothing to do and

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,420
yet again something we need to discuss

49
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,030
but ok so so here are the fixes that are

50
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,770
coming for the player

51
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,810
who might purchase it in the future or

52
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,500
return to it the December 4th next week

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,360
they're going to increase the stash

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,550
limit really now you get more glue

55
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,100
increasing it for 400 to 600 and that's

56
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,740
good because I mean obviously the stash

57
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,410
thing was so fucking annoying numbered

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,580
all the time

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,860
well that is tied to what what the

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,080
server can handle cuz obviously the

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,670
server needs to figure out you know how

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,230
many items you have what they are and

63
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,600
take it from server to server so that's

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,760
fine boss lute player should correctly

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,280
receive two or three items after taking

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,900
down of Oz and that's something that we

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,640
talked about a little bit in the review

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,030
getting randomly not getting legendaries

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,250
number one even though you're fighting

70
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,620
legendary people and then sometimes just

71
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,830
getting like one-star legendaries from

72
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,830
fucking and a really difficult boss

73
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,020
battle so they know and they're fixing

74
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,410
that yeah they're rewards it's really

75
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,720
bad cryolator effects players hit with a

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,910
cry later now chilled frosted froze and

77
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,560
depending on how many are hit without it

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,200
wow that was a problem respawning went

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,880
over encumbered we resolved in issue

80
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,470
affecting players who died wall over

81
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,820
encumbered that only allowed them to

82
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,950
respawn at ball 70 say sometimes it

83
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,420
didn't anyone it didn't even let you

84
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,690
respawn you had to just close the entire

85
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,660
game and then stuck in power armor we've

86
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,950
addressed an issue in this patch rate

87
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,570
you could cause you know I'm stuck in

88
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,430
power arm yo there's the patch that they

89
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,110
didn't do three years ago instead they

90
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,600
still not doing the patch that's not it

91
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,060
that doesn't resolve that I think that's

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,100
actually a problem with the engine and

93
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,470
their peoples are other engines fine and

94
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,100
dude guys work on that fucking engine

95
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,170
seriously I mean you don't need to throw

96
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,660
it completely out I'm not of that camp

97
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,300
that thinks that you need to throw their

98
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,860
engine could bleed out it makes me

99
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,500
worried as fuck that star field and

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,750
Elder Scrolls six better look nothing

101
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,350
like fallout nothing like fallout 76

102
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,500
that engine better be backtracking on

103
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,390
that so much different what do you mean

104
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,370
backtracking

105
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,169
fallout 4 look way better oh yeah yeah

106
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,120
well I I don't know if I would say way

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,010
better I think that the color really

108
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,060
helps out

109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,620
it was it was I would say this looks

110
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,680
slightly better than follow me it's it's

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,870
just because fallout 4 was so driving

112
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,520
and I was just and I'm glad there's

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,200
color here so then so that's all

114
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,050
December 4th then December 11th the next

115
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,210
update you'll have PC additions

116
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,280
push-to-talk setting December 11

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,980
multiple we had to wait for three weeks

118
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,669
to do this that it blows my mind that

119
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,560
that wasn't it's like it's like these

120
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,389
people when they get in their design

121
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,340
meetings they don't talk about anything

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,080
and they're goofing off or doing

123
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,030
something I have everybody with thumbs

124
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,800
up their asses because that should have

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
been like the very first thing have you

126
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,729
never played an online game but there's

127
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,590
it it seems like nobody in your office

128
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,419
has a branded this is your first online

129
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,840
game no technically well there's well

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,990
yeah but that's the game studios but

131
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,850
you're right in that Elder Scrolls

132
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,500
online so you should have learned some

133
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,419
of these lessons or ZeniMax especially

134
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,070
since ZeniMax their publisher like

135
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,840
ZeniMax would have been like hey what

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,300
guys that you need to do these things

137
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,200
because players you know as the fov

138
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,669
slider mentioned there yeah 12 21 by 9

139
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,410
and a field of view settings are all

140
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,240
being implemented on PC with this update

141
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880
if it was that easy why wasn't it in the

142
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,620
original you can do it through the any

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,479
like you like you send your review but

144
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,490
like were they really that lazy not to

145
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,710
just put that in the freaking settings I

146
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,389
read somewhere that because of the

147
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,940
engine it like fucks with trees and in

148
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,740
Lego kid I know that's what confuses me

149
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,200
so maybe that that shit wasn't correct

150
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,139
but we got a special respect after level

151
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,669
50 you'll finally be able to choose

152
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,320
between a new perk card or moving a

153
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,729
special point you had previously

154
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,370
allocated so they're letting you respect

155
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,479
but they're letting you respect like

156
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,330
super slow so it's basically you either

157
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,460
choose a perk card or you choose to move

158
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,490
a point right yeah well at least it's

159
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,810
there it should have been there from the

160
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,690
beginning camp placement this is

161
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,060
something that that todd said you could

162
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,360
build anywhere like previous fall outs

163
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,490
you can play this game so low in quest

164
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,889
but the easiest way to survive in the

165
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,500
wasteland is to team up and build

166
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,370
together and in this one you can build

167
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,800
wherever you want and you can also then

168
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,139
move that to wherever you want and you

169
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,240
can't build anywhere it's so there's

170
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,400
always like you're running around trying

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,740
to put your fucking camp down and you

172
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,720
can't put it in cool ass places

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,550
ironically there's a lot of places that

174
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,440
you shouldn't be able to put it but you

175
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,270
can and then the places you should be

176
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,020
overly yeah like I just found like I

177
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,789
mean we didn't show in the review but I

178
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,190
found like a legendary boss spawn in one

179
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,569
of the actual buildings you're not

180
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,220
supposed to be able to build in and I

181
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,599
said screw it I dropped my camp there

182
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,979
put turrets up where it couldn't attack

183
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,449
and every time I load into a server just

184
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,050
dies

185
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,819
and now they got something called

186
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,740
bulldozer this is a new camp feature it

187
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,150
allow you to remove small trees rocks

188
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,800
and other obstructions so it's easier to

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
place your camp great players are not

190
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,759
gonna bulldoze everything I was in

191
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,449
fallout 4

192
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,750
- no they won't they won't bulldoze

193
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,370
important things it probably won't be

194
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,500
able to actually bulldoze those elements

195
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,349
but that's good that's going to all help

196
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,380
the game but this is in very very minor

197
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,409
ways and that's December 4 December 11

198
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,659
so as you can see in December you're not

199
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,169
really getting anything major and you

200
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,669
gotta believe that because they're

201
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,800
working on all these fixes they're

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
taking time away from their updates yeah

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,150
I mean there's a lot of like caught new

204
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,310
content yeah but I mean like at this

205
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,259
point I don't even care about new

206
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,759
content I want to be able to play the

207
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,590
game for five minutes without a game

208
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,150
breaking bugs like they're not even

209
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,310
mentioning that you do no damage bug

210
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,169
that 70% of the player base is

211
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,819
encountering you look at your riff that

212
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,650
completely breaks again we've showed

213
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,569
that off multiple time it happens it

214
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,000
happens with every gun randomly and like

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
you go look at the YouTube comments in

216
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,250
the review and there's people

217
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,050
straight-up saying I can't play the game

218
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,459
for more than five minutes without this

219
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,890
happening and it's it's they're not

220
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,469
talking about it and I can't even play

221
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,450
it anymore for hilarity sake because I

222
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,880
just I log in 11 seconds in I got the

223
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,740
bug last time I tried to play yesterday

224
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,089
and I was like I'm done just all that

225
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,380
Ford and just didn't even look at it

226
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,839
again yeah losing items a lot of these

227
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,020
different types of bugs the power armor

228
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,240
and okay so let's actually get into the

229
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,430
extended discussion the spoilers

230
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,650
discussion where we weren't really able

231
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,290
to jam some of this in the review it's a

232
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,150
forty minute review guys I hope you

233
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,190
enjoyed but I had to cut some parts out

234
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,470
so first off a lot of you said I was

235
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,350
generous with my score of three out of

236
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,390
ten I'll be honest with you I actually

237
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,520
gave it a two out of ten I could play a

238
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,520
clip here you know that I was I was

239
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,529
showing stream that I recorded a two out

240
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,190
of ten but so check this out the final

241
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,210
verdict for fallout 76 is it to a two

242
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,400
out of ten maybe it could have pulled a

243
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,089
4 or a 3 but to release in this state to

244
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,790
rely to us this month to charge everyone

245
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,380
that much in microtransactions for this

246
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,080
never again alright so that that was the

247
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
original but at the last minute and

248
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,740
that's why the final score section is

249
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,750
kind of jiggered around it's all messed

250
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,529
up and I gave it a 2 or I gave it a 3

251
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,650
when I really feel that after watching

252
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,860
my own damn review and after watching so

253
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,960
many other issues from other players a 2

254
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,360
would have been a statement you know to

255
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,930
Bethesda this this is like super

256
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,790
unacceptable but you know over time I

257
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,700
mean Dell did reach on and forty hundred

258
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,890
and eighty hundred eighty you couldn't

259
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,570
play the game that long well number one

260
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,380
it's his job so he has to but other than

261
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,360
that do you think it's a two out of ten

262
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,860
or you think is a three out of ten I

263
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,110
mean now it is I can't even fucking play

264
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,710
it anymore

265
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,110
yeah at least when I said hey I'm at a

266
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,030
three it was because I could play for

267
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,560
like an hour or two without my game

268
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,540
completely breaking but they did a patch

269
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,270
and they broke it even more and it's

270
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,180
like I can't do anything now it feels

271
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,400
like the server's go down every like

272
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,500
five minutes I'm in a match I can't do

273
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,860
damage my UI glitches out my inventory

274
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,470
breaks it's just not playing well it's

275
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,360
not playable anymore I think Joe the

276
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,550
reason why because you know we gave it a

277
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,240
three is because you know it's a time

278
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,580
waster you know it's really good at you

279
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,770
you it could waste your time when you're

280
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,180
playing with friends is fun but that's

281
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,730
you know well not even really that

282
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,839
fun ouch but no the game not playing

283
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,910
with you obviously see that's probably

284
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,399
what got me playing with Joe play with

285
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,990
Joe is always fun playing with Dell is

286
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,300
always fun so that probably got a pity

287
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,769
point from me and it's the fact that

288
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,050
it's Bethesda and I am literally a

289
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,500
Bethesda family ok it but I'm starting

290
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,449
to have my eyes open if you guys watched

291
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,699
Jim Sterling's video he made this great

292
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,190
point it's like me you know the idea was

293
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,959
that maybe we've had rose-colored

294
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,699
glasses a little bit and if you go back

295
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:37,779
and you look at some of the other

296
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,680
releases this isn't anything like

297
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,570
massively new no that's all doesn't it

298
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,760
be this broken I mean it's been broken

299
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,190
in the past but this is to me this is

300
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,230
something new this is unplayable this is

301
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,820
so boring I don't want to play people

302
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,290
were so used to it they even made that

303
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,029
joke at their press conference like oh

304
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,529
the internet says our games are very

305
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,110
buggy on launch like yeah that's a

306
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,029
problem why are you making fun yeah it

307
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,209
like it goes from cute to that this shit

308
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,120
ain't funny anymore like dude do not

309
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,709
reference that again without an apology

310
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,260
all right that's this is not cute

311
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,649
okay so all right so let's talk about so

312
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,360
in their press release they said they

313
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,889
you know they got the list of fixes

314
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,550
there they say Oh a million players why

315
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,709
do you gotta brag when you're trying to

316
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,350
apologize that's basically like fuck you

317
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,180
well it's basically like look at all

318
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,940
these people we conned it's it's like we

319
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,889
conda million people instead let's tell

320
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,240
you how many people we fooled

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,529
yeah instead of just saying we're sorry

322
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,970
for the issues with the game they're

323
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,649
like yeah but millions of people are

324
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,600
playing in it's like that just seems

325
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,240
super high to me yeah it sucks that it's

326
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,420
not on Steam anymore because on

327
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,100
Bethesda's they didn't you can't tell

328
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,870
how many people I think I know why that

329
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,760
is - because they're not offering

330
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
refunds and if they had been on Steam

331
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,449
they would have had to abide the steams

332
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:58,060
refund policy and they don't want it so

333
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,579
there's this whole thing with you know a

334
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,399
potential Clause class-action lawsuit

335
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,319
I'm not into those kinds of things I

336
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,600
think maybe a lawsuit is a little too

337
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,610
excessive it's a little too extreme

338
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,209
there for certain games maybe like when

339
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,550
they come out completely broken that I'm

340
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,980
oh but I was able to play this one but I

341
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,720
hear from some people they weren't you

342
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,870
able to play so I don't know in lawsuit

343
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,139
no lawsuit just revolves around how hey

344
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,120
we were giving refunds and then they

345
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,949
stripped that away and so it's deceptive

346
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:32,199
business practice which is hey you yeah

347
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,939
these people are legally entitled to a

348
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,800
refund so when you tell somebody we're

349
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,149
gonna give me a refund and then later on

350
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,290
you're like we're not going you really

351
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,779
fun it's like no fuck you and so that's

352
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,129
why they're doing something they're like

353
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,930
all right well if you're gonna do that

354
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,060
to us we're gonna find some pretty much

355
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,129
all you can do yeah all right so yeah I

356
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,600
understand that

357
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,879
but yeah so players like what I said

358
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,550
here's players are done with fallout 76

359
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,980
pretty much mostly I mean they'll likely

360
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,889
only get back about you know twenty five

361
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,779
percent of their users after they fix

362
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,980
all this I mean they're they're not

363
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,350
addressing from those patch notes the

364
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,029
the fourth which is like they need to

365
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,160
get big stuff fixed they're not

366
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,750
addressing the fact that the final boss

367
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,160
scales with player level and is

368
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,959
unkillable if you don't cheese the game

369
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,209
they're not addressing like any sort of

370
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:18,699
the major game breaking issues like the

371
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,339
damage bug like we said or the server

372
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,769
crashes stability anything there it's

373
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:26,259
they're not fixing what they need to and

374
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,089
it's like yeah things like an fov slider

375
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,339
and push-to-talk or cool but it doesn't

376
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,740
matter if I can't even log in like and

377
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,600
it doesn't matter of so many different

378
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,189
game elements of the game are broken

379
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:39,279
we're gonna go over those now but to add

380
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,509
on to my point people have already

381
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:44,110
played 30 hours 40 hours 80 hours 120

382
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,899
hours that's why it's so important to

383
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,139
get your game dawn on release and and

384
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,540
get it right the first time okay cuz

385
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,699
they're done with it I'm telling you

386
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:56,740
even if you fix it very few players are

387
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,709
coming back but maybe for this I don't

388
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,839
want them to not fix it because this is

389
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,149
something they owe all of us yeah I

390
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,410
spent $200 on this plus tax it's

391
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,569
ridiculous so you need to fucking fix

392
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:11,800
that but like you said it's probably

393
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,639
gonna take forever so anyways I

394
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,439
something I had to pull out of my review

395
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,420
is the framerate on consoles I really

396
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,860
wanted to show you guys this clip from

397
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,379
YouTube and these guys did great work

398
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,689
baffles show horrendous slow down even

399
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,639
patched with frame time spikes all over

400
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,980
the place on the Left graph pulling the

401
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,929
trigger on any gun and especially for

402
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,060
automatics will chew into frame rate

403
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,010
until the clips unloaded so what that

404
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,690
means is the one moment you need that

405
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,640
solid performance is taken away from you

406
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,980
taking down enemies with grenades makes

407
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,350
it plummet further on ps4 and it becomes

408
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,940
too erratic to hold your target reticle

409
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,710
on any enemy for much longer than a

410
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,200
second this was a problem in fallout 4

411
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,150
but it can't go on like this for an

412
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,250
online game where team play is a factor

413
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,580
and as you can see here on on consoles

414
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,620
Dell this shit is even worse it's

415
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,360
terrible like the fact that we have

416
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,850
high-powered computers probably is why

417
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,710
we got a game with the three because we

418
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,930
didn't run into any of this type of

419
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,140
performance issues if the shit was

420
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,660
running 15 frames a second as you see

421
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,240
here and I was playing that this shit

422
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,830
would have been a - yeah the load times

423
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,390
were crazy on some of the places in

424
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,310
consoles - like one minute two minutes

425
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,320
just to go in and out of a building and

426
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,390
it was just I can't imagine that

427
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,880
so now considering that the consoles are

428
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,160
two out of ten and the PCs probably a

429
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,500
three out of ten is what I'm thinking

430
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,210
but alright let's go over all the

431
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,730
fundamental negatives of the game okay

432
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,010
and I want to talk about let's start

433
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,710
with PvP first it blows my mind that

434
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,840
this game it's okay so did they get the

435
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,970
coop right yeah but that ties into

436
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,300
another point AI right so you can't

437
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,790
really get the coop monster hunt

438
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,790
together right when you have shitty AI

439
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,570
on everything it is it is honestly one

440
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,790
of the it's there brain-dead AI they've

441
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,800
had ever since like fallout 3 and Skyrim

442
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,140
and they have not innovated at all with

443
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,270
it and you go you know like you said

444
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,700
co-op is fun and in some cases but every

445
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,000
monster is stupid as hell and they just

446
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,970
lets you shoot them yep and so these big

447
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,470
battles with like death claws and stuff

448
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,450
they just go and they just stand there

449
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,070
and they growl at you and they die and

450
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,660
that's all they do yeah I had one stuck

451
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,130
in the alleyway I was picking them off

452
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,870
yeah there's like a tiny little trash

453
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,550
can in front of him or just like a piece

454
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,990
of wood and it just stands there he

455
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,610
doesn't understand how to get around it

456
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,530
that's the kind of AI you deal with so

457
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,610
that's what I said

458
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,130
try to talk about PvP he's got two sides

459
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,230
co-op in PvP but even the co-op is

460
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,559
fucked because of the AI and now the PvP

461
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,230
is completely shit I mean they're

462
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,600
probably the only good aspect of the PvP

463
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,460
is when you do the radio what is that

464
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,370
that radio style arena maybe that kind

465
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,080
of thing is a little bit better than

466
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,629
this random I'm gonna shoot you a bunch

467
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,730
of times to let you know I want to fight

468
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:03,999
you

469
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,070
yeah and then I met a disadvantage

470
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,749
because I'm already using resources to

471
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:09,340
start killing but you don't do any

472
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,230
damage you don't do any damage then they

473
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,210
get the first shot on you even though

474
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,769
you want to start the fight so there's

475
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,539
no sneaking up on something so sneaking

476
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,190
up on someone even if you're wanted and

477
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,840
you're not on the map anymore like you

478
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,039
know you're stealth and around you've

479
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,259
already flagged yourself even if you

480
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,539
find like if your level 200 and you find

481
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,610
like a level 7 yeah if you have a the

482
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,799
most powerful gun that ever existed 10

483
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,269
million damage a shot you're not gonna

484
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,309
damage them yeah we showed it we showed

485
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,110
you that I'm the exact click which is so

486
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,240
funny that we've also got a PvP damage

487
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,950
above yeah at the same time one

488
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,659
recording that the damage bug effects

489
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:43,090
everything including players I guess

490
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,639
which is insane and that was only four

491
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:48,580
minutes of being logged in so yeah I

492
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,409
told him for that specific purpose we

493
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,119
need to get some footage and it fucking

494
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,919
broke it that's hilarious

495
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,019
I shot three times and it busted on the

496
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,419
third shot and I was like so even if he

497
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:00,879
does initiate combat with you it's not

498
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:03,970
fun the combat in Fallout 76 is just

499
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,950
it's not good okay you're running around

500
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,399
and you have these piece-of-shit weapons

501
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,139
unless you're you know unless you played

502
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:15,129
to level 180 right but you're fighting

503
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,200
each other and then your healing and

504
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,119
you're fumbling through your inventory

505
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,909
and the dice of resources it's only a

506
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,240
waste of resources in time and why why

507
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,340
what is the endgame once you kill the

508
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,289
guy there's nothing and the problem is

509
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,570
the person you pvp's and starts it or

510
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,970
like a tax up building or something your

511
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,549
bounty goes up so fast and you can't

512
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,440
fucking kill the people who are coming

513
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,840
to kill you correct so not only do you

514
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,519
get nothing I mean you get like

515
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,320
resources but you know whatever they

516
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,539
have even cool shit yeah you don't see

517
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:48,669
the cool shit that they have and pull it

518
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:50,919
off instead what you get is a huge

519
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,809
fucking bounty you don't really get

520
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,789
anything rewarding is what I mean you

521
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:56,440
get this huge bounty so you get nothing

522
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,240
but negative and that's why in the game

523
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,390
nobody pvp's nobody nobody

524
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,410
and that's the point when 50% of your

525
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,470
game idea or 30% whatever you want to

526
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,900
quantify it as is completely

527
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,580
non-existent and broken that that's

528
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,730
awful

529
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,679
and what was messed up is we tried some

530
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,480
of the PvP events where you're supposed

531
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,130
to fight each other right and there were

532
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,630
times where it was so buggy we were

533
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,940
getting bounties for fighting in an area

534
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,940
designed to PvP in completely broke

535
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,190
absolutely busted like absolutely all

536
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,890
right but okay so and then not only that

537
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,950
but the respawn so you kill this guy and

538
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,559
he responds right next to you and then

539
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,350
starting fighting again like in some

540
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,480
cases like 10 feet away from you because

541
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,549
you are now bountied and you are now

542
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,830
able to be shot and killed and it just

543
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,990
goes over and over in this big loop

544
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,790
until one of you is like fucking I don't

545
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,380
want to do this anymore than you long

546
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,530
ago oh fuck finds that fun no one who

547
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:06,940
nobody you know what we should implement

548
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:14,530
oh I know I want PvP and fallout I think

549
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,929
it would be a great idea let's let's

550
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,730
talk about how they could have fucking

551
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,210
done it right you know I mean way way

552
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,610
bigger map and actual factions you can

553
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,559
form we're like the only two ideas like

554
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,179
they have they have they have talked

555
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,400
about faction based PvP oh they talked

556
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,620
about but what I think it would be

557
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,630
better is if you start letting us see

558
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,080
servers right and you give us some PvP

559
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,790
servers were you going it's a hardcore

560
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,540
fucking server you go in there and

561
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,250
somebody could kill you at any time now

562
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,230
yeah it's a little unfair with the level

563
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,780
1 ATS like you're you're organized if

564
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,610
you get lucky and get a legendary like

565
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,530
the one I got that does like 5,000

566
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,360
damage exactly it doesn't matter it does

567
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,770
not matter how good the other players

568
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,679
and it's level 15 gone I'm using a level

569
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,480
15 can you right but that see that

570
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,760
exposes something in the game it would

571
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,340
not be fun it wouldn't be fun because

572
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,770
you have these these legendary dice

573
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,360
rolls on your weapons that can kill

574
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,250
somebody in one shot it's literally

575
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,490
like it's like judged level 37 and he

576
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,230
has that gun and he shoots you and and

577
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,210
he's bought ask naked like his character

578
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,460
likes dragon yeah I could be drugged out

579
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,470
of my mind in the best armor have the

580
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,600
perfect stats that guns gonna want at me

581
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,540
every single time so so they have this

582
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,980
fundamental problem because they didn't

583
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,230
design the game from the ground up with

584
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,570
PvP and mind to where okay if we have

585
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,520
PvP servers we need to balance some of

586
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,680
these things and now they have to go in

587
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,710
and back and do all of that balancing if

588
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,060
they want to do it right which I don't

589
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,980
think is ever gonna happen no it's not

590
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,490
at this point if they balanced PvP like

591
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,080
if they went and started changing the

592
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,390
core fundamentals of their game for PvP

593
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,960
it would completely break the PvP or PvE

594
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,240
aspect and I'd say about 95% of the

595
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,740
players at this point don't even want to

596
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,150
fight each other because the taste has

597
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,780
been ruined

598
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,580
yeah well that well that's what I'm

599
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,780
saying there needs to be separate

600
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,980
servers you have your role-playing

601
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,350
servers you have your PvP servers and

602
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,970
then you just have your casual servers

603
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,080
for people that just want to

604
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,880
cooperatively beat up on a shitty AI

605
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,160
right so so that's a fundamental broken

606
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,150
piece of your game the AI the PvP the

607
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,770
endgame talk to us a little bit about

608
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,690
the endgame Dale since me and Joe didn't

609
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,970
give a fuck enough to go to the endgame

610
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,520
so the entire endgame is around the

611
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,110
Scorch those really generic

612
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,480
means that apparently everybody turned

613
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,000
into in five minutes I'm stupid that

614
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,350
there's no Raiders at least Raiders have

615
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,270
personality if they talk to you they

616
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,880
taunt you you can hear conversations of

617
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,620
them talking to each other it feels

618
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,050
alive scorched yes they're fucking

619
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,570
zombies so you gotta launch a nuke you

620
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,070
got a nuke this thing called a fissure

621
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,080
you there's the prime fissure which is

622
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,670
where the Scorch beast queen the person

623
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,960
that's are the thing that started all

624
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,380
this is and so the idea is you launch a

625
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,150
nuke on her she pops out you fight her

626
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,340
you have 30 minutes to fight her but the

627
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,410
problem is if you have anybody above

628
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,570
like level 30 trigger her sh her level

629
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,400
scales based on the character that

630
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,070
spawns her and so she's supposed to have

631
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,690
preset health she has like 5 million

632
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,700
health or something preset at level 50

633
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,520
if I run in and spawner at level 95 she

634
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,090
has hundreds of millions of HP you saw

635
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,560
that gun the gun that was killing those

636
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,720
mirelurk Queens in one shot yeah

637
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,909
it was moving her health a fraction of a

638
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,890
fraction of a parcel yeah and it was

639
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,350
like I'm hitting therefore 5,000 damage

640
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,150
every shot my allies were unloading

641
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,740
thousands of rounds in her health is

642
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,770
like one inch not even bene and that's

643
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,150
why we said in the review it's a

644
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,980
complete waste of say I can't do it

645
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,380
unless once you kill her she drops yeah

646
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,120
she's gonna drop some three-star

647
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,070
Legendary's and some schematics for like

648
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,260
the ultra site stuff but that's not even

649
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,720
worth it yeah exactly you can find you

650
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,370
can get lucky and then you can get lucky

651
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,409
and not fight her and get way better

652
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:01,179
weapons what we're saying so your end

653
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:02,440
game is completely fucked

654
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,950
you have the nukes that that the codes

655
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,340
are on fucking ready Joe pissing me off

656
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,049
yeah you waste your time right just like

657
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,610
you know these codes I already got the

658
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,429
codes what and then you drop you

659
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,140
everybody goes to alpha cuz it's the

660
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,419
easiest and then you drop the fucking

661
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,010
nukes but don't drop more than one at

662
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,580
the same crash the problem is now that

663
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,740
we know what the nukes do we were

664
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,780
willing to do the code thing before now

665
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,580
that we are before we knew what they did

666
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,870
like we thought it would be way cooler

667
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,000
than it was but now that we know that it

668
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,919
just spawns some glowing guys that kind

669
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,600
of could drop loot like if they went to

670
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,100
the sisters up some buildings if you

671
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,360
built a fucking camp

672
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,590
but you could just rebuild your camp

673
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,210
instantly and if they went to the system

674
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,679
where it was randomized every time

675
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,179
nobody would launch nukes anymore

676
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,950
because that's like hours and hours of

677
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,169
work for something that's not even worth

678
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,150
30 minutes of your time laughter it

679
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,610
happens so the world events are all lame

680
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,400
you know like feed people no I don't

681
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,169
want to fucking feed people feed them

682
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:09,820
nukes like we said but you see this is

683
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,320
the stuff that players want to do cuz

684
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,240
players are shitty right see if there

685
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,919
was a human settlement guess where that

686
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,000
nuke is going today it was in the wall

687
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,860
three you remember like how cool would

688
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,179
it have been if there was like actual

689
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,130
NPC towns and when you nuke them like

690
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,380
you get the implement they're named but

691
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,600
they're like horribly mutated and you

692
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,070
could be like I'm killing the vendor I

693
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,510
didn't like cuz he's a zombie

694
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:38,860
nope so just the idea of a multiplayer

695
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,620
Fallout can be done right and the

696
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,650
game is nothing is nowhere near the

697
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,870
quests were so boring like it didn't

698
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,050
want me to pursue anything else with

699
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,780
these holotapes I didn't like these

700
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,020
holidays yeah that's it tape us are lame

701
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,330
what is the most fun quest Dale that you

702
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:06,780
ran into I don't know maybe it's the

703
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,750
Brotherhood of Steel bass line in the

704
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,030
sand it was a world event where you're

705
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,410
in like a fort and there's a missile

706
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,570
launcher and the Skyrim dragons flying

707
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,070
around and you're like defending and

708
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,960
guarding them is that first time I did

709
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
that I was like okay this is this is

710
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,390
this is one that they should have put

711
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,460
right at the beginning okay do you

712
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,809
imagine that one right at the beginning

713
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:31,230
or at least maybe midway like okay but

714
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,960
that's like the end of the game I know

715
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,730
and if there were multiple ones of these

716
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,410
then you're on the right track instead

717
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,410
you got turn the water valves and and to

718
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,330
make some you can have that in the game

719
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,890
but those need to be filler and in

720
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,960
between and you need to make them unique

721
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,790
okay well yeah we don't want to tell

722
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,320
people to just turn this water valve we

723
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,640
want to tell people turn the water valve

724
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,440
and then water actually starts to flow

725
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,690
in that amusement park and it's all

726
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,420
radiated and then and it does something

727
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,640
or it shows it to you but it doesn't do

728
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,150
any of that

729
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,890
it does jack-shit you want to know

730
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,809
something hilarious what so you know the

731
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,030
overseer quests you know how she's like

732
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,710
leaving tapes for you but you never meet

733
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,200
her she's still alive if you go in and

734
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,360
into one of the silos and you read the

735
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,770
tit you grab the tape out of the box

736
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,210
before you go in she's like I found a

737
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,160
silo this is cool when you go in there

738
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,200
and you come back out you left another

739
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,300
tape for you that's like how could you

740
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,920
launch this nuke and it's like why

741
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,720
didn't you just say that to my face

742
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,240
like you were here five minutes ago yeah

743
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,580
well it that that happens from time to

744
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,650
time in these holotapes where the

745
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,020
holotape knows exactly when you do

746
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,550
something you remember that Joe we were

747
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,100
like searching in an airport and we were

748
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,520
doing a stupid Patrol and that we went

749
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
to go do something and the tape was

750
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,150
talking to us like oh good you killed

751
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,130
all those things like wait a minute do

752
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,960
that you knew which ones we killed so

753
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,500
so stupid that there is no human NPCs

754
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,669
and that's the other thing

755
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,059
human NPCs why did they not include it

756
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,370
because there are actually NPCs in this

757
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,620
game there are but they're not human

758
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,860
yeah there's the super mutant with his

759
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,020
cow yep so funny anyways

760
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,990
Bessy the MooMoo yeah Holly the movement

761
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,840
the movement see like that is the kind

762
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,940
of if we had way more interesting guys

763
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,130
like that and he's funny and he's

764
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,419
awesome but you have one you got one and

765
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,029
that proves that they can have NPCs

766
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:33,490
right so you know at first I thought

767
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,500
maybe if you have NPCs it breaks the

768
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,659
game or Bethesda simply didn't know how

769
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,490
to do it because if you have human and

770
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,260
then you kill the human then your quest

771
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,559
line is fucked but guys do you really

772
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,419
need me to explain it to you this was

773
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,010
figured out in like 1999 8 where you Jin

774
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,980
mmo's you let people kill them but they

775
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,020
just get knocked out and then they get

776
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,450
back they reach five minutes or

777
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,789
something exactly you give that person

778
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,130
the satisfaction of killing him and then

779
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,620
if you want some penalties they're then

780
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,840
put a fucking huge bounty on him and

781
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,390
make him read immediately sort everybody

782
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,890
in the world can sneak up on him and

783
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,320
kill him for killing an NPC even though

784
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,149
that NPC gets backed up after being

785
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,980
knocked out like in Skyrim their own

786
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,990
fucking game already did it they have

787
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,490
the solution like you said I don't know

788
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,230
if it was Todd the thought that players

789
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,120
were gonna want to be role players but

790
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,429
you didn't even put systems in the game

791
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,640
to incentivize them to act like that to

792
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,760
be NPCs so why would they ever write

793
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,820
like there's no real like economy where

794
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,340
you know I I saw this video on one guy

795
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,929
was talking about like you can make all

796
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,970
the best prime rib steaks in the game

797
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,320
and everybody's gonna come to you two

798
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,120
for the best prime rib steaks I'm like

799
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,010
what the fuck are you talking they're

800
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,470
not but as you forget some power you can

801
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,210
decide like I'm gonna focus on I'm

802
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,559
cooking it and you might want to vet you

803
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,520
can sell these things

804
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,200
to other people on the game so you're

805
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,670
like I make the best we're by stake in

806
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,040
the game it'll it'll over fulfil you and

807
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,620
give you a health bonus and here you go

808
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,700
40 caps yeah I can farmer myself in five

809
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,050
minutes what are you on about

810
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,880
yeah so I have no idea what they were

811
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,710
going with with this game sometimes you

812
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,510
think it's a survival sometimes you

813
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,190
think it's just a co-op fallout and

814
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,230
sometimes you think it's an MMO but

815
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,970
that's the big problem is that the

816
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,920
design team are making these three

817
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,050
different games and none of them were

818
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,480
very good and all of the design

819
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,430
decisions behind the game were wrong

820
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,870
yeah they were terrible wrong bring that

821
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:43,390
back Superman alright guys time to make

822
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,730
it fun at this fucking game but I'm

823
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:52,120
gonna continue that's let's go on I'm so

824
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,780
tired

825
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,120
let's there's so much shit in this game

826
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,700
that sucks John I know that in between

827
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,290
like a lot of these things we talk about

828
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,330
he's gonna show all the extra clips that

829
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,150
we find there was like 50 extra twitch

830
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,220
clips we got from just stupid bugs and

831
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:26,840
they were fantastic

832
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,399
okay so fuck vats let's not even talk

833
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,169
about it let's talk about the fact that

834
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:34,639
you can capture bases and sell the shit

835
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:37,500
Delta tell me what's happening here so I

836
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,139
found out that even if somebody puts

837
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:42,750
down a ton of turrets the workbench that

838
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,309
you capture to get the place to build

839
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,320
anyway in the first place if you just

840
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,480
walk up to it and capture it back their

841
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,279
turrets don't even shoot you and then

842
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,809
when you captured you could just help

843
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:56,309
authors and and I was like no no fucking

844
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,130
way and is there a negative to that

845
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,960
person that built all those turrets did

846
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,090
he waste all those resources they spent

847
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,529
goes away you don't get a bounty or

848
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:11,210
anything nothing do you see do you see

849
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,279
though this was not planned out oh I

850
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,710
need an explanation for this but does I

851
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,929
really do because this worries the fuck

852
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,870
out of me I think I have one okay I'm

853
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,059
about to blow y'all's minds okay okay

854
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,100
how did this happen

855
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,309
Todd number one Todd lying to us

856
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,330
yeah okay Todd or what would you call it

857
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,059
some people you know they'll kill me if

858
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:37,919
I say anything bad about Todd he was

859
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,740
hyping his game up to an insane level

860
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,110
that it started to become disingenuous

861
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,899
just like the no man skies not even not

862
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,580
even know shittin like there were

863
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,429
straight-up lies in the press conference

864
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,080
about things that weren't even in the

865
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,029
game yeah I mean interviews yeah but

866
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:55,740
okay by now I could show you clips of

867
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,360
those but instead I'm gonna tell you

868
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,880
that you know he said like all of these

869
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,970
studios fallout 76 is by far the largest

870
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,860
project that we've ever done it

871
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,559
encompasses parts of the studio in

872
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,190
Maryland

873
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,260
Austin Montreal for Bethesda Game

874
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,480
Studios as well as we're getting a lot

875
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,240
of help from other parts of Bethesda

876
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,770
some of the great folks at ed software

877
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,280
our pain is that our max online and so

878
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,889
it really is a huge undertaking not just

879
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,599
for us but all parts of Bethesda

880
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,510
listeners one two three four five

881
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,849
studios that worked on this I really

882
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,940
think that this was only worked on yeah

883
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,010
those studios did contribute probably

884
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,690
like the old assets hey do you have that

885
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,589
uh fuckin horse can all right skin that

886
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:53,490
texture yeah well that's kind of the

887
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,829
other studios oh so don't fucking throw

888
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,290
ID under the bus and shit they're all

889
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,119
making do them they're like wait what we

890
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:11,880
do it's probably what happened anyway so

891
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,410
I think what happened and it breaks my

892
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,569
heart cuz I live in Austin I love Austin

893
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,760
I love Austin studios but I think this

894
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,650
game was developed primarily by the

895
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,619
Austin studios that got their game got

896
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,369
shut down and shuttered this was

897
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,869
Bethesda it they rolled it into Bethesda

898
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,460
Game Studios and they've not put out a

899
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,160
game yet okay this feels like a first

900
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,650
attempt this feels like the talent is

901
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,660
not quite at the level of their other

902
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,670
Triple A studios who have delivered

903
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,960
games I'm not saying you're talentless

904
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm just saying you're new at this and

905
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,190
this what's that what that feels like

906
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,740
there was a game called battle right no

907
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,109
battle cry does anybody remember this

908
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:52,950
know you're I was walking around in e3

909
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,410
and some of the paksas they had big

910
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,510
booths for this game it's a bethesda

911
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,190
game it never came out that was being

912
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,380
worked on by the austin studio battle

913
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,660
cry or something like that and it was

914
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,510
basically a copy again it was a copy of

915
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,180
overwatch I wanted to get into the hero

916
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,819
arena shooter apparently it wasn't good

917
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:13,440
enough or they didn't think it would do

918
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,910
well millions of people playing all

919
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,190
right that's right there's a brag what

920
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,440
happened what no I think they got that

921
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,119
decision right I don't think it would

922
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,109
have done well because you remember that

923
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:29,760
other game that we liked from battle

924
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,550
battle it was a battle it's everything

925
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,890
battle I think actually battle boy

926
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,589
yeah and and we liked it but it didn't

927
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,630
do as well as overwatch it did got

928
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,730
shuddered and shut down they released it

929
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,500
two weeks before overwatch which was

930
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,029
like yeah so but I think that was the

931
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:49,470
right decision for them to shut that

932
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,480
down right it might have been cool for

933
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,180
for a while I probably would have been

934
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,359
better than fallout 76 and that's a lot

935
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,859
of work from those guys and my heart

936
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,210
goes out to them because those are

937
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,799
original characters that probably could

938
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,180
have been cool could have had some fans

939
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,980
instead it gets shut down and they're

940
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,299
like they probably got moved to this

941
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:07,410
they're like alright now you're gonna

942
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,690
work on the fallout 4 engine and you're

943
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,309
gonna pump out a game and I need it in a

944
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:14,220
year what they don't know how to fucking

945
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,650
do that are you serious they did a

946
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,690
documentary remember that huge like one

947
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,039
outlet document yeah they did a

948
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,539
documentary over time they'll be working

949
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,829
on this I have an idea four years ago

950
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,559
yeah well everybody had the idea eight

951
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,930
years ago everybody had the idea and

952
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,910
fallout 1 when you were playing that

953
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,349
shit this would kind of be cool if I can

954
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:36,690
play with friends yeah I mean so don't

955
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,940
give me that shit right but okay but

956
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,529
what I'm saying is so that that studio

957
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:42,930
took the brunt of it and it was just

958
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,779
completely unfair to the guys in Austin

959
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:47,789
to take the brunt of that and push this

960
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:49,380
thing out as fast as possible without

961
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,180
the experience the knowledge and that's

962
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,460
why so many studios had to help that's

963
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,349
why I had lists all those people because

964
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:56,819
they didn't have the expertise and

965
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:59,250
they're being fucking pivoted so quick

966
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,529
and then they rolled in another studio

967
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,660
escalation Studios which they bought up

968
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,250
and got rolled into Bethesda Game

969
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,829
Studios as well back in 2007 and their

970
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:10,230
mobile games okay and so you get a

971
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,940
little bit of that influence maybe the

972
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,009
perk cards and the microtransactions

973
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:17,160
arrive early and and and then you've got

974
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,720
this game so I think that's what

975
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,240
happened is there B team or not even

976
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,579
there B team there C team worked on this

977
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,670
game and but yet the disconnect here is

978
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,849
that Todd presented this as a triple-a

979
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,640
game from the best of the best this was

980
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,549
a tentpole release and it comes out and

981
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:38,250
it's utter garbage it's garbage

982
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,769
shit a lot of people just felt betrayed

983
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:43,380
as hell because he was promoting and

984
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,779
flaunting this game everywhere and

985
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:48,089
talking it up and saying things that

986
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:48,420
were

987
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,650
to be in the game that weren't in the

988
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,780
game and you know I saw people defending

989
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,040
him like oh maybe he didn't know the

990
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,930
extent of how bad it was no he had to

991
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,390
oven his he's attitude he knew and he

992
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,360
was ok with it like I I like Todd and I

993
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,150
met Todd I talked with Todd several

994
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,180
times I was just like hey man I forget

995
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,670
what I said to him but I was like you

996
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,590
know I was like dude I really love your

997
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,110
games and I think you're a fantastic

998
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,080
producer I just gave him so much praise

999
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,570
and and he was really nice and smiling

1000
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,880
and he was like wow and I was like I'm a

1001
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,470
little nervous and he's like you don't

1002
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,850
have to be nervous I was like yeah I

1003
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,950
never get nervous and it's because like

1004
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,140
he's made my favorite game series of all

1005
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,720
I am elderscrolls like I love those

1006
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,700
games to death and angry Joe got nervous

1007
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,230
around him and I felt embarrassed and

1008
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,020
he's like nah man it's cool and then but

1009
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,870
and then the very next thing that comes

1010
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,410
out and he and I believed him I believed

1011
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,900
in time all the things that he said

1012
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,980
because all its spark on his eyes and he

1013
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,770
was me you know this guy you know this

1014
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,630
nerd in high school he talks about the

1015
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,060
ballot cowboy joke and he said well I

1016
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,260
didn't want to be the desk alva

1017
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,610
quarterback I'm gonna make video games

1018
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,350
for a living and they all made fun of

1019
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,330
him and stuff and he's doing it and

1020
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,980
that's my dream I want to make board

1021
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,410
games for living and and and so I just

1022
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,450
loved that success story of Todd and

1023
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,490
he's won awards and he deserves those

1024
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,310
awards and I I hate to see targets shit

1025
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,830
on so much but honestly you know when

1026
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,110
you do when you make something amazing

1027
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,240
you get the praise and angry Joe gets

1028
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,770
nervous around you you make something

1029
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,870
shit and angry Joe's gonna fucking yell

1030
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,550
at you you know what I mean this is

1031
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,160
deserved I'm serious it's dessert no

1032
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,900
it's it's a hundred percent deserved and

1033
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,720
I think I mean the fact that they're not

1034
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,580
just owning up to it the fact that they

1035
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,770
haven't done like a hey we we came from

1036
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,600
humble roots this is what we do for a

1037
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,310
passion we made it or at least be honest

1038
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,170
with people yes this was for Austin

1039
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,930
studio with our mobile studio and and

1040
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,910
we're learning this is the first time

1041
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,010
we're doing a multiplayer experience in

1042
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,710
this way with these people and we're

1043
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,600
learning a lot from it and then maybe

1044
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,550
drop some little hints that in our

1045
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,320
future games we could start putting in

1046
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,580
multiplayer because we've learned so

1047
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,070
much and make this sort of you know okay

1048
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,340
they

1049
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,500
learn from it and now our future games

1050
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,450
are gonna be better and instead they

1051
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,150
drop this like bullshit PR apology where

1052
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,800
they don't even really apologize no it's

1053
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
not that's not an apology thank you for

1054
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,730
playing millions of you have played we

1055
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,830
can't wait to fix the game ya know like

1056
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,410
it feels so not human like a corporate

1057
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,170
entity is just like we're sorry was that

1058
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,970
something I want to talk about yeah I

1059
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,850
also really really like Pete Hines I've

1060
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,430
met him several times conversations have

1061
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,290
always been good actually when I first

1062
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,820
started I don't think people liked me

1063
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,730
very much because my interview style I'm

1064
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,140
real aggressive and I was asking him

1065
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:44,070
hard questions and he anyway yeah and

1066
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,140
and and we had this relationship where

1067
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,610
he'd give me a look and I give him a

1068
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,370
look but yet we do it anyway because you

1069
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,080
know I at least I had the audience and

1070
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,730
Bethesda I'm gonna be honest with you

1071
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,350
for a time that des des was the most

1072
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,110
friendly to youtubers I've seen one of

1073
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,310
the companies as good as Ubisoft

1074
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,980
friendly and open and they know and they

1075
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,130
talk and but lately I have to say this

1076
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,230
they've become a lot more corporate I

1077
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,690
don't feel I feel like Bethesda is

1078
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,480
losing their way there is are they

1079
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,060
smelling their own farts at this point I

1080
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,920
see with this coming out and they're

1081
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,680
getting so involved and and then they

1082
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,780
got the whoo they got the whiff of that

1083
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,530
mobile micro transit and fallout shelter

1084
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,780
no that's that's why blades is coming

1085
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,100
because they were like okay we want it

1086
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,900
we need now we need to do this with

1087
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,700
every single one of our franchises it

1088
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,190
worked so well with Fallout and fallout

1089
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,680
shelter frankly is a good mobile game

1090
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,350
okay and and I'm not gonna shit all over

1091
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,300
fallout shelter because guess what the

1092
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,550
game is free and you can put as much

1093
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,170
money as you want into it I don't

1094
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,120
recommend you go crazy because you know

1095
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,550
that helps ruin our other games that's

1096
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,870
that's the danger and and and now we're

1097
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,310
gonna get blades and I think blades is

1098
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,110
gonna be one of the best mobile games

1099
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,840
but I'm really worried about those

1100
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,040
microtransactions in there

1101
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,070
it better be free anyways so you have

1102
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,510
all that kind of stuff and I'm worried

1103
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,860
that but des des is becoming too

1104
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,270
corporate and they're losing their way

1105
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,770
and they're turning into a little mini

1106
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,980
EA a little mini Activision and I just

1107
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,360
want to tell them guys

1108
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,690
like stop it please remember what got

1109
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,430
you here because as as quick and as well

1110
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,140
I don't know if it was quick but your

1111
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,970
rise to to such great community standing

1112
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,130
and people love and adore your games it

1113
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,190
can be destroyed you you are ruining

1114
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,020
your reputation I think you the

1115
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,420
community is taking a huge hit right now

1116
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,120
I don't think you can unless Elder

1117
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,970
Scrolls six is like the best game we've

1118
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,250
ever played in its and so like the thing

1119
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,470
is is because you guys have gone and

1120
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,720
released such a crappy game you've

1121
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,150
basically made your job 50 times harder

1122
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,920
with the Elder Scrolls 6 because now

1123
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,120
you're gonna be under that microscope

1124
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,860
you're under the mind you're like so if

1125
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,010
you're getting it is if there are game

1126
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,900
breaking bugs and buff every other game

1127
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,280
you've ever released because your story

1128
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,870
was good you got to look past it people

1129
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,160
were like I'll look past the fact that

1130
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,260
my save gets corrupted that I have all

1131
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,120
these quest issues it's a good game it's

1132
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,590
Bethesda but now that you released

1133
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,540
fallout you can bet your ass that

1134
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,700
everybody is going to go over your game

1135
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,470
with a fine-tooth comb and pick out

1136
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,390
every problem but I guess what guess

1137
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,100
what I don't care about the black still

1138
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,170
if there's bug like him I care about

1139
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,050
game breaking bugs okay but but I'll

1140
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,180
even forgive some of those if you can

1141
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,280
find fixes around it what I care about

1142
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,120
is your game design tentpoles the the

1143
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,070
major decisions that were made and

1144
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,620
fallout 76 that we're all wrong I want

1145
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,700
PvP to work

1146
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,250
I want PvE to work I want the AI to work

1147
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,350
I want quests to be good I want there to

1148
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,510
be a story that actually you can listen

1149
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,700
to I want there to be interface

1150
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,130
improvements these kinds of things are

1151
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,410
what's important to me yes you are gonna

1152
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,240
get raked over coals just because it's

1153
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,400
funny and it's YouTube content that a

1154
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,260
lot of channels are gonna do anyway even

1155
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,940
if maybe you don't deserve some of it

1156
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,800
it's coming just because of what you did

1157
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,330
here would fall out you set yourselves

1158
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,280
up for that and like you you've honestly

1159
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,650
they have removed a lot of their buffer

1160
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,210
they had that people were willing to

1161
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,160
tolerate because now you're the goodwill

1162
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,690
from the community it's destroyed it's

1163
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,270
gone and really hurt your standing with

1164
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,070
your community and I think your apology

1165
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,930
just made it worse like honestly non

1166
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,330
apology that that basically shows us

1167
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,150
that this was a cash cow this was

1168
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,160
literally we don't have a major

1169
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,920
tentpole let's pivot cancel battlecry we

1170
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,329
need something fall out

1171
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:35,099
everybody loves fall out we can make

1172
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,170
money no matter what on fall out no

1173
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,270
matter if we put it out Todd it's not

1174
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,200
ready man

1175
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,750
we need another year I'm sorry I just

1176
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,760
don't have the talent right now and it's

1177
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,260
taken us a little longer I'm sorry can

1178
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,270
we just get another year no you're

1179
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,069
putting this out now that may not even

1180
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:51,900
be tongs fault it's gotta maybe balls

1181
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,789
Todd it's marketing fuck is the

1182
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:55,349
president over there because I've never

1183
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:57,599
heard of ever met him I've only seen

1184
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,000
Pete Hines who's VP where the fuck is

1185
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,280
the president it honors a shadowy it's

1186
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,410
it's a fucking it's a fucking assault

1187
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,690
Ron it's the fun master from fire it's

1188
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,369
pretty much just it feels like they had

1189
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,230
to make a quota on numbers and sales at

1190
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,849
the end of the year and I mean they

1191
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,650
could have taken it why did bethesda do

1192
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:16,530
this it's money money has to be money

1193
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,329
and don't accept my money like seven

1194
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:20,730
times i bought like skyrim on every

1195
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:28,260
fucking console and we should talk about

1196
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,920
that too so the question is why did

1197
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,440
bethesda put this out no temple releases

1198
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,480
this year was it for their shareholders

1199
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,670
it's a publicly traded company i don't

1200
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,770
think i don't know to keep them afloat

1201
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,079
that's why they put this one out right

1202
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,480
to fund future games to or to make a

1203
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,940
quick buck i think i think it was all of

1204
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,829
those and i mean like you know by us

1205
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:51,210
saying they haven't released a major

1206
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,010
game like we're not talking the sister

1207
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,500
subsidiary studios under like arcane and

1208
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,089
aired and stuff yes they've released

1209
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,130
games but bethesda themselves hasn't

1210
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:05,130
this came out this year a lot 7676 and i

1211
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,440
don't repeat their big game yeah that's

1212
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,069
what I mean

1213
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:11,160
alright it that just it blow it bugs me

1214
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,319
alright guys do you think will it go

1215
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,930
free-to-play Joe no you don't think

1216
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,270
there's a goal in Christ job but they

1217
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,130
what they won't do it won't do it they

1218
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,559
won't budge on that I know what do you

1219
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,450
what do you think I think they will just

1220
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,130
because like every other game that I've

1221
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,230
seen has realized that you sell your

1222
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,750
game for 60 bucks you wait about six or

1223
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,339
seven months to when nobody's playing it

1224
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,630
and then you release it for free and you

1225
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,190
add more micro transactions and you

1226
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,319
double your money mm-hmm that's every

1227
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:38,970
even world of warcraft no I wouldn't put

1228
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,410
it past him at this point just because

1229
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,900
of all the steps that they

1230
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,630
so many people - so I don't know if they

1231
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,849
fix everything in February 25 percent of

1232
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,799
the people come back and and then

1233
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:54,480
they're like we have to monetize those

1234
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,010
people because we didn't get all of the

1235
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,049
people back they've got to do it in some

1236
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,670
way you're gonna get more micro trends

1237
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,680
and I'm gonna go for it it's gonna be 20

1238
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,289
bucks or free to play guys in the

1239
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:05,730
comments tell me do you think the same

1240
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,279
is gonna be free-to-play now here's the

1241
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:10,500
worst thing okay do you think they're

1242
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,220
gonna monetize the perk card system it

1243
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,220
feels like game probably I mean does it

1244
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,829
why where why did they create the perk

1245
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:22,559
system why is it a pax I have a theory

1246
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,339
and it's a conspiracy theory but it's

1247
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,950
it's coming from it's coming from the

1248
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,230
place of betrayal why'd you betray me

1249
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,630
now everything that you've done has been

1250
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,339
put into question including the perk

1251
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:38,010
system I think this is they put it there

1252
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,619
and they put no microtransactions and

1253
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,450
they give you them at intervals to see

1254
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,359
what happens and guess what happened

1255
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:47,069
every single review on YouTube that I've

1256
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:49,200
seen even including ours but I softened

1257
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,390
it is oh I love this new purchaser

1258
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,130
what's one good thing up the perk system

1259
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,109
yeah yeah the perk system is great I

1260
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:56,700
didn't say it's better I said it was

1261
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,950
interesting yeah it's not better because

1262
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,900
and but everybody's saying oh it's

1263
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,490
better it's great a great great

1264
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,770
inventory but and so they've gotten all

1265
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,109
that positive feedback now and I think

1266
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:09,299
that was that was the little planting

1267
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:11,460
the little seed and like Halo in the

1268
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,339
Halo franchise it's going to pop up in a

1269
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,670
future game if how about this if they do

1270
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,609
that skill system that perk system in

1271
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:23,400
Star field or in Elder Scrolls 6 and

1272
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,369
it's monetized or you can buy packs what

1273
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:30,839
would you guys do flip the fuck out yeah

1274
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,670
probably laugh and be like I told you so

1275
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,430
you buy the game or boycott the game um

1276
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:41,849
I gotta buy the game no matter what we

1277
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:45,000
have to do but if I didn't write

1278
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,700
probably not I probably wouldn't fucking

1279
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,470
die the game until it's free because

1280
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,559
that shit is fucking yeah if I was right

1281
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,089
or we didn't have the job for it that's

1282
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:55,800
predatory that's gambling

1283
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,840
shit and if you want to do that fine

1284
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,760
make the game free I mean the the perk

1285
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,380
packs already you like when you get five

1286
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,850
levels and you get that booster pack and

1287
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,470
followed something six it's all flashy

1288
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:08,100
you can get duplicates repeatedly and

1289
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,220
this is like rare is like bellick's

1290
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,870
yeah it seems like it was originally

1291
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,970
developed as a free-to-play game with

1292
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,390
this as the main system to get money and

1293
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,310
they probably saw if this really was in

1294
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,870
development for four years which I

1295
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,240
highly doubt but let's say it is let's

1296
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,670
believe them they saw what happened to

1297
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:29,310
EA battlefront too tied directly to

1298
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,020
progression and they're like fuck we

1299
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,090
cannot have that because our stocks will

1300
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,660
take a hit so I almost kind of think in

1301
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,150
a conspiracy theory way that this system

1302
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,950
was being developed or at least it was

1303
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,380
discussed in design meetings should we

1304
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,870
monetize this can we monetize this and

1305
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,700
now I'm scared in the future that

1306
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,840
because it received so much positive

1307
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,240
feedback that they might be able to take

1308
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,890
that extra step I'm telling you right

1309
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,750
now but that's duh

1310
00:50:54,750 --> 00:51:00,480
no no any news PU you think this is

1311
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,080
backwards I need a roll stop it man I

1312
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,780
need the rolled-up newspaper but anyway

1313
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,850
don't do it you think this is bad with

1314
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:18,060
fallout 76 no fuck with the elders do

1315
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,920
not fuck with progression and

1316
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,410
microtransactions or you will go the way

1317
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,540
of EA not only will you have destroyed

1318
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,100
the goodwill with the community but

1319
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,380
you'll have a revolt straight up those

1320
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,270
me as a fan that's one of my feet

1321
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:33,690
you'll lose me no so J I will be your

1322
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,350
opponent

1323
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,050
instead of your supporter okay anyways

1324
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,270
so please don't do that with the perk

1325
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,820
system and I think it's prime and setup

1326
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,630
for that anyways so um you know what I

1327
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,210
want to talk about it didn't make it

1328
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,800
into the review but I sent you a

1329
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,710
screenshot of I had a bug where I lost

1330
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,810
four thousand caps from something that

1331
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,450
was didn't work and it cost four

1332
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,310
thousand and so when I sent a ticket in

1333
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,830
and the first thing was when you design

1334
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,600
an MMO or multiplayer game you designed

1335
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,360
tools to let your CSRs and your customer

1336
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,980
support help people who are having

1337
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,880
problems with your game

1338
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,560
when I sent the ticket in and you'll

1339
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,910
probably throw up a picture of the

1340
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,430
response email I got they basically just

1341
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,040
said we don't got those tools we can't

1342
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,050
fix quests we can't reset characters we

1343
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,400
can't give you items we can't do

1344
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,170
anything and they admitted this and it's

1345
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,480
like that's it's probably it's probably

1346
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,330
a third party call center are you still

1347
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,010
we're gonna call center long ago and all

1348
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,410
you have is knowledgebase right and you

1349
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,820
and you click on things that's probably

1350
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,350
all they have but every other that

1351
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,550
employees like yeah I'm just gonna be

1352
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:39,180
honest but every other MMO every other

1353
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,250
online game that's online only like this

1354
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,680
game if an item breaks or your character

1355
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,050
just does not work their game masters

1356
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,090
can fix it and they even said we can't

1357
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,430
escalate it we just can't touch yourself

1358
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,010
the responses from Bethesda they need to

1359
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,870
look into how they deal with customers

1360
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,970
because somebody sent me a screenshot of

1361
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:00,060
somebody saying hey the DA I ordered the

1362
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,160
$200 collector edition and it said that

1363
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,620
there would be a premium duffel bag or

1364
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,870
they said that what material it would be

1365
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,610
or they showed of material in the

1366
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,710
marketing materials and it turned out to

1367
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,350
be a piece of shit nylon duffel bag and

1368
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,750
somebody sent in a support ticket hey

1369
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,700
can I get a refund or can I get a

1370
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,380
compensation or something like that

1371
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,610
because you're showing something and it

1372
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,220
wasn't that and the response was so

1373
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,770
flippant that I was like no the internet

1374
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,660
had to change those words around yeah

1375
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,030
but because that's how bad the response

1376
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,770
was it was something like oh yeah we

1377
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,660
know it was it was too expensive to do

1378
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,940
the other thing and yeah we don't ever

1379
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,290
plan to do anything about it

1380
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,900
bye you didn't say it let it say it

1381
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,700
exactly like that but I swear to God if

1382
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,100
you read the actual things it's like

1383
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,620
this has to be somebody's last day yes

1384
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,560
or or the internet fucking changed it

1385
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,660
but that doesn't change the fact that

1386
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,670
the fucking thing is a piece of shit

1387
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,200
they can't fix problems in their own

1388
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
game which to me is hilarious because if

1389
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,530
I went through their ticket system on

1390
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,000
their website and it's like account

1391
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,680
problems character problems item

1392
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,560
restoration we can't restore items was

1393
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,270
the response I got and it's like why is

1394
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,790
that an option then like what's going on

1395
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,800
and it's just they didn't even have the

1396
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,140
forethought to be like oh we should

1397
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,970
probably have the ability to fix these

1398
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,670
bugs where we're four players before the

1399
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,880
game came out you you copied and pasted

1400
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,470
to Fallout universe

1401
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,660
on to a survival game you're so late to

1402
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,700
the survival John roof failed because

1403
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,950
all the game systems in there aren't

1404
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,750
built for the game they're built for

1405
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,260
Fallout 4 and they're poor choices a

1406
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,930
fallout MMO I think could work I think

1407
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,240
you could actually do a real fallout

1408
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,530
multiplayer game and it might work if

1409
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,640
everything was created from the ground

1410
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,010
up it could be something special but

1411
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,880
other than that no it doesn't work so

1412
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,530
let's talk let's end the video by

1413
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,080
talking about the future of Fallout 76

1414
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,730
the future content they're talking about

1415
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:59,160
faction based PvP will you come back for

1416
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,210
that no no will you do world events if

1417
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,760
they put there's already world events in

1418
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,910
there they're awful I you can do to fix

1419
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,580
like here's one thing that I think

1420
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,020
they've been telling us the whole time

1421
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,760
it's been in front of our face I'm gonna

1422
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,560
reveal it for you guys they're doing

1423
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,140
human NPCs they're gonna put in human

1424
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,060
NPCs to try to get people back I think

1425
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,609
it's their one ace in the ACE that they

1426
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:25,200
could try to get people back what do you

1427
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,690
you guys believe me now okay here's why

1428
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,000
I think so because they've said multiple

1429
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,700
times now that other vaults will be

1430
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,250
opening they keep referencing the fact

1431
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,520
that other vaults are gonna open that

1432
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,740
that to me guys realize that confirms

1433
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,470
human NPCs doesn't it no I think they're

1434
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,940
just gonna do what they did with the

1435
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,440
other vaults and the other games where

1436
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,640
they're already they're all dead in

1437
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,080
there yeah they're gonna have like quest

1438
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,070
lines you're gonna go in there and

1439
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:56,640
you're gonna listen to fuck right though

1440
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,230
like they they're gonna do they're gonna

1441
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,580
be DLCs and they're gonna be like

1442
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,859
missions for specific vaults but you're

1443
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,599
gonna get if that happens I'm far

1444
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,980
everyone's gonna go ahead and you're

1445
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,480
gonna hit a button on a recorder like

1446
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,730
you know like I'm already done but I'm

1447
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,040
done done the drums are sounding in the

1448
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,570
deef and oh my god alright

1449
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:19,170
human NPCs yes or no dough no human NPCs

1450
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:22,140
yes or no rules maybe not actual people

1451
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,200
I I think you are wrong in order to save

1452
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,790
their game they have to put in the

1453
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,670
number one request just think they're

1454
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,070
gonna try to do the patches and just try

1455
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,280
to do the bare minimum

1456
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,810
their minimum and then they had planned

1457
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,610
I think somebody date a mind like six

1458
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:41,370
DLCs they're all free because nobody

1459
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:45,300
would pay for that yeah at this point I

1460
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,750
you can't you can't fix it like you can

1461
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,790
fix the technical problems but the game

1462
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,220
every single part of the game is busted

1463
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,700
or awful and this is a shock to it can't

1464
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,360
fix it you you just can't I am so so

1465
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,320
disappointed in you Bethesda $18 for

1466
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,890
fucking blue four blue are you serious

1467
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:12,660
with this evolve your memory the ball my

1468
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,480
dog no a weapon and he fall was more

1469
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,000
generous it was blue but it was blue and

1470
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,040
it was fucking blue but they didn't even

1471
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,350
make like unique looking power armors or

1472
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,790
something different like even in their

1473
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,170
live-action trailer there's a guy that

1474
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,420
looks like he's got an alien's colonial

1475
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,090
type that's not in the fucking game at

1476
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,740
least I haven't fucking seen what I've

1477
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,420
seen and that's the kind of stuff that

1478
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,550
maybe you could charge eighteen dollars

1479
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,430
for if you fucking put some alien stuff

1480
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,280
on it but that would be fucking IP theft

1481
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,660
anyways yeah

1482
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,910
guys that's it fallout 76 it's done

1483
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,580
they're gonna be bogged down by fixing

1484
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,370
all the bugs and the fundamental broken

1485
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,870
game designs for the next two three

1486
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,360
months and then they'll start to put out

1487
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,190
the DLCs but by then they'll only have

1488
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,290
20% of their player base yeah let's be

1489
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,390
real if they go as dispatching pace

1490
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,420
it'll be two three years or never or

1491
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,610
never they'll just be like the community

1492
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,950
Oh finally I'm gonna laugh so hard if

1493
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,370
there's a Windigo man in star field oh

1494

1498
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,840
don't care if it gets 100 views this was

1499
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,090
therapeutic for us and we got to give

1500
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,620
you a little insight into the review it

1501
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,540
was a 2 out of 10 until I cut it last

1502
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,460
minute and honestly it deserves a 2 out

1503
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,950
of 10 it could eventually become a 3 out

1504
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,360
of 10 how high do you think the game

1505
