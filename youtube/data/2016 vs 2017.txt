9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,280
See, look, Jimmy Kimmel. I don't care.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,240

I was so young and naive.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,180
This just in! NOOOO!!

21
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,560
What if we install facial recognition software into Snapchat to change and adapt to the users face?

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:55,410
..That way they could render their appearance to different colors shapes or even animals. *clapping*

23
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:11,240
So... I was thinking ..dancing hotdog.

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:23,070
Oh my god, why are dudes dressing like dads nowadays?  ( gagging noise)

25
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:30,210

36
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,320
I don't know, you think maybe we'd place these ads more strategically, or at least not mid-sentence anyway..
