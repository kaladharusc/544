1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,850
one of my favorite things about making

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,250
YouTube videos is that I get to decide

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,350
the videos that I'd like to watch and

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,500
make them exist hi welcome to I cut soap

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,809
and show it to my dog while he's wearing

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,049
a turtleneck for those of you that

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,210
aren't aware first of all Kermit doesn't

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,980
really like that turtleneck but he's

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,420
putting up with me right now

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,949
we found out that carpet has a soap

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,170
fetish so I figured out which soap was

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,519
his favorite which is overwhelmingly

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,619
Irish Spring and then I made him an

14
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,260
entire bed at your suggestion out of

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,420
Irish Spring which he hated so we're

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,340
gonna try and see if he likes the

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:47,129
YouTube trend of soap cutting me your

18
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,100
hands are filthy someone suggested that

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
I should just show him a bunch of ASMR

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,510
soap cutting videos but like he's not

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,820
gonna understand that he's a dog but

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,739
thank you for your suggestion so I

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,899

that one was too loud I don't know for

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,270

58
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,650
relaxing when I do it not very excuse

59
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,130

to be relaxing you know stop that we're

71
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,200

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,590
to hear a friendly content yes it is

73
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,450
look at my dog he's wearing a turtleneck

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,620
in classes

75
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,650
it's lovely content it seems to be

76
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,360
indifferent about would you like a

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:36,440
little salt can you stop using that

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,480
voice because you're ruining the

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,160
relaxing effect of low voice you do like

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,050
little choppy rocker I don't really like

81
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,910
cutting soap as much as I thought I

82
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,790
would it's actually kind of different

83
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,800
well that was rude if you're done with

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,420
your classes you can take them with your

85
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,310
face and place them on the table I don't

86
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,900
know why you felt the need to throw them

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,480
on the ground what do you think mommy

88

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,110
interested but he's also like

99
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,700
embarrassed I don't know he's not

100
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,310
embarrassed we've gotten over this like

101
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,650

106
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,340

110
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,460
that are like much more entertaining and

111
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,410
cool and relaxing and sound better than

112
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:43,680
what I'm doing but I'm trying my best

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,440
