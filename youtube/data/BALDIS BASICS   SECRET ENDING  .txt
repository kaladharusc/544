Ugh- FFF

20
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,480
The graphics looks really bad.

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,240
Excuse me, is it not 2018. What is this?

22
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,620
Mouse sensitivity?.. PFFT

Look at the graphics guys.

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,560
You need to collect two notebooks before you can use these DOORS.

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,220
Can you just not talk to me and look at me or do anything related to me? That would be great.

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,000
THENX.

WHOA! Jesus.

49
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,100
What the hell is happening?

50
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,460
What are you doing in there?

51
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,020
Okay, fine.

52
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll get the notebook.

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,100
OH *SMACK*

60
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,120
Okay.

61
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,740
What's with the butt smacking?

62
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,680
No running in the halls.

&quot;When will you learn?&quot;

(in high pitched voice) WHEN WILL YOU LEARN?

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,790
What is this game?

71
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,250
Fine, two more seconds.

72
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,200
Why is everyone making a D sucking face? Seriously..

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,340
What?

74
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,360
What was that-  despite her poor- Oh

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,380
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, HAHAHA

76
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,280
Fantastic.

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,180
Okay.

78
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,840
So, what is that?

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,560
What is this?

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,280
I got a coin!

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,740
Okay, that's always good.

82
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,340
All right. We're just in school.

83
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,460
This is like a regular school game.

84
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,120
Hey, we got chocolate now.

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,220
Wow! What a great game. What a great game, guys.

86
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,400

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,100
OH NO

88

NO

89
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,085

90
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:14,760
Oh god.

91
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
I should know better.

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,100
He's right.

93
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,540
Okay, we haven't gotten spanked yet. So, I think we'll be alright.

94
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
I'm a little spooked out.

95
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,720
There's something... something not quite right about this game.

96
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
What the hell was that?

97
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,660
Alright, I guess we just collect more notebooks.

98
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,180
Alright..

99
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,940
I'm just gonna do-

100
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,043
I'm just gonna do them all correctly.

101
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:37,260
WHO'S ANGRY AND WHY?

102
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm the angry one.

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,600
I am the one.

104
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,500
Another notebook!

105
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,900
Is there any point for me to do these? Oh my god.

106
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,880
Oh, wait.

107
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,600
Edit that out.

108
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
That's right.

109
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,240
I used to study math at university everybody.

110
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,849
Okay, we found school cafeteria. Cool. Can I use the item somehow?

111
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,680
Aw, I can't.

112
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,020
Oh god, there he is.

Don't spank me.

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,300
Oh god.

117
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,880
Oh god.

118
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,440

All right, I guess not. I guess we won't go in Oh God

124
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:29,620
That is a beautiful picture. You know, I didn't want to say it, but I think we're looking at some game of the year material here.

125
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:38,300
Is there even any point for me to do these? Oh wait, I'm a good moron

126
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,440
(something sweden) NOOOO- no running in the halls- I don't care

Damn. 3: DETENTION FOR YOU. Your parents will hear about this one.

Yes, of course. This game makes too much sense it hurts

133
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,750
Okay, I play the cassette. Oh god he's coming, he's coming

134
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,850
He's coming. Oh

I'm not scared ain't scared and nobody. Hey, we got cars everybody. Yes

137
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,600
Principals keys. Okay, that's good. We might need those. Yes. We're doing great. What is this be soda? Great. I'm glad

138
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,260
Why did we have that? Okay. All right, our fourth notebook. We're doing absolutely...

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,240
fantastic

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,400
How am I supposed to know that I am so okay. That phone can't hurt me

141
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,640
Right. Hello, mr. Phone. Oh, I have a quarter

Okay, that's great,that's great, that's great, honey. All right, let's check out you how you how do you do

146
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:30,919

147
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:39,349
No, it's not sweeping time, it has never been sweeping time and there will never be a sweeping time

148
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:44,479
No

149
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:52,180
He's coming here by I can hear him. Oh there is me sorry. I finally it's mine

150
00:06:52,180 --> 00:07:00,740
Okay, cool, oh this is where we weren't in the beginning? shit, oh, this is real bad this is real bad guys

151

What is that

153
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:14,449
Jesus Christ this game is annoying. It's worse than the PewDiePie video. Am I right geesh?

154
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:20,710
I'm so ridiculously focused to just beat this stupid game, which I know is a li'l silly guys

155
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,500
I know it's a little silly of me. Great he's right there. That's fine

156
