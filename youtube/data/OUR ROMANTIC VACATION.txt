can this is over there probably family victim i think a good place to start

10
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,450
would be to explain the boat that we were on there was a cruise and it was

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,620
the same thing that we want for our honeymoon we love it

18
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,220
and she keeps like lifting your dress shopping pcr entire she's like wearing a

19
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,740
long it's wildly inappropriate all kids and families around here and then these

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,920
two and this has come here at the bar you love Backstreet Boys

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,739
our room and the boat was tiny but totally fine perfectly adequate

22
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,920

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,430

25
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,700

26
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,390
saying this is a nice data files like some feminists that now my name is but

27
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,180
little did I know it's just some too lazy and the people that are on this

28
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,340
motor like mostly middle-aged no related right retired people we were on the

29
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,030
younger side of the people on this boat remember the dance party

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,319
but then we had all this trouble in the airport that ultimately ended with us

31
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,930
getting to Venice and having no luggage whatsoever all of our suitcases were

32
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,730
missing

33
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:39,519

34
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,890

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,459
that's like fifty percent of the day two of the holiday we're in I don't know how

39
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,500

41
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,540
of excited about buying more ski club that it was just inviting the cheapest

42
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,359
as at least expensive clothing we can find to keep ourselves dress look at

43
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,720
this mannequin with something seemed trying to strange with her

44
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,310
we just got some crucial information

45
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,900
they found one of our bags as in either canvases bag

46
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,870
for my bag if it's candice is back i'm going to be very upset but happy for you

47
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:58,570

48
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,590
right yeah

49
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,870
a woman came up to candace and said Candace your luggage and I think she

50
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,979
meant luggage

51
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:14,889

53
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240

54
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,510

the boat would stop somewhere like everyday regular cruise you could go to

59
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,490
the town that you stopped in or you can stand the boat if you stay on the boat

60
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,480
my favorite thing to do is you they let you swim off of the back of the boat

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,480
