00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,820
Marlon I see you out there yeah I got

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,750
you all my monitors okay see it but stop

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,269
you know I got you kisses you can't

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,309
sneak up on me like that you know I just

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,049
I just went down to your office and

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,100
radius snacks again somebody just sent

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,140
these to me they're too good I got like

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,529
three dozen of them

9
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,920
all right Marlon yeah take care

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:41,610
I slipped on the ice four times during

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,500
my run this morning and I mean like I

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,760
went down

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,579
I'm bleeding in two places and it was

14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,570
cold outside so 14 miles into my run my

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,480
iphone died which means no music and I'm

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
not that I lost all the data pertaining

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,730
to what was a very good run probably

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,579
like 16 miles that like a seven and a

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,729
half eight minute piece total failure

20
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,920
this morning total failure

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,869
question does your iphone die if it gets

22
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,740
even remotely cold out it's like chilly

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,600
maybe right now but it's not like I have

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,130
to kill my horse and climb inside of

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,570
it's hollowed out carcass to stay alive

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,000
cold out and this thing dies it's

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,240
exposed at all to the air is it my phone

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,240
or is it iPhones

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:57,690
let me know it's not that I don't

30
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,409
appreciate this but I feel like whoever

31
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,050
is sending me all this stuff is trying

32
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,429
to make me fat look at all these cookies

33
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,519
from the fancy bakery two cupcakes in

34
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,940
this place is like five dollars each

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,330
thank you

36
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:36,900
however something is cookies I don't

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,200
know if you remember this thing or not

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,030
it's one of my favourite toys I actually

39
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,760
dropped out of the back of my car and

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
then I left it outside overnight two

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,450
nights in a row and then I wrote it in

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,079
the ocean

43
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,690
and even it still works but it kind of

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,150
acts a little bit funny I describe this

45
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,310
the company and they were like you think

46
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,340
we know what the problem is so they sent

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,810
me a new foot pad sensor you know one of

48
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,640
the things that Candice says that she

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,709
really likes about me is how tough my

50
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,019
hands are you can never really trust a

51
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,470
man that has really smooth soft hands to

52
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,850
fix this thing you have to unscrew eight

53
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,370
allen head screws and rather than

54
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,570
turning this allen wrench like a

55
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,220
thousand times I'm just going to chop in

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,570
half so I can put it my power driver now

57
00:03:30,570 --> 00:04:02,230
I don't have to turn it by hand

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:09,200
feels responsive fast you forgot how

59
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,570
awesome this thing is yeah you want to

60
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,470
try you can try it

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,359
good go for it feel it now just kind of

62
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,739
lean the direction you want to go nice

63
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,400
don't go too fast bye guys

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,590
as an adult you can't play with a toy in

65
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,410
public and not let a child try your toy

66
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:51,020
if they ask so why don't they tell you

67
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,310
where the blades are supposed to go so

68
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,450
what did we learn today the propellers

69
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,610
that have the holes on this side and the

70
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,520
propellers that don't have holes and the

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,050
propellers that don't have holes on this

72
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,260
okay I missed that I'm sorry it's dark

73
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,430
out now

74
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,900
pardon back in the park it's kind of

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,230
dark out here but Manfrotto the company

76
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,670
has sent me all those tripods they sent

77
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,640
me this panel light ready it's so bright

78
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,970
it's like having a little mini Sun right

79
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:54,520
you throw a little light down yeah

80
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,470
okay so far so good have not crashed the

81
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,690
drone but it's above me

82
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,400
all right pretty impressed with this

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,660
thing so far

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,840
with this thing for sure

85
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,490
Ilyn is I couldn't figure out how to

86
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,990
control the camera I just watched a

87
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,640
YouTube video on how to control this

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,520
thing I think I figured it out you have

89
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:26,710
to use two fingers to control the camera

90
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,440
12 seconds later alright another wildly

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,509
successful flight I mean I landed in the

92
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:37,759
snow but all things considered in a

93
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,500
dream world what I want from the drone

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,870
is I want total autonomy I just throw it

95
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,639
in the air and it follows me there's

96
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,280
nothing on the market that does not this

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,080
thing's pretty close I was very

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,940
impressed with that give it a haven't

99
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,139
seen the footage but I really care if

100
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,550
the footage is good or bad I just care

101
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,389
if it got the shot importing the footage

102
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,030
now really exciting to see this it

103
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,680
hasn't imported yet I can't quite tell

104
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,509
it from the looks of it it's kind of

105
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,310
dark which is disappointing because I

106
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,319
tried to go out when the Sun was out but

107
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,539
I couldn't figure out huh I can't give

108
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,400
this thing a for review yet but I can

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,090
say doesn't work terribly well in low

110
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,240
light oh that's so disappointing alright

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:56,490
I'll show you the footage anyway

112
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,940
thank you very much

113
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,940
bro see you guys later I didn't mean to

114
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,830
make a video about a drone today it's

115
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,690
trying to make a video about fixing

116
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,880
things but then I got all distracted

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,510
then I got all obsessed and then

118
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:21,520
paraffin this is the wrong one I need to

119
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,000
unscrew the one that has the wire
