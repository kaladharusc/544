- That is a problem. But I think I've got just what you need!

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,100
It's something I like to call.....

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,320
(more chuckling)
- Whoa! Now that's a design! But Lena, my brain is bad, I can only remember things that have a catchy tagline!

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,240
- Whoa! Now that's a design! But Lena, my brain is bad, I can only remember things that have a catchy tagline!

(dangerous chuckling)
-Oh, boy! That'll be stuck in my head for days!

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,060
Let the master show you how it's done. What's up, Toby? Seems like you have a problem.

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,000
- You bet I do, Lena!

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,700
I'm just too tired to do *this*!

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,960
(dying hacks)
I'm just too tired to do *this*!

That's a doozy! Well, have I got just the thing for you!

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,440
(dying wheeze)

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,220
It's simply called....

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,680

34
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,220
(sounds of a dying man)
- This looks great, Lena, but without a tagline, I'm afraid I just won't remeber it.
