the city are always like family time I

6
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,070
sneak when I can't to workout run time

7
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,509
to the office pretending to have

8
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,399
important stuff to do and mostly just

9
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,190
shoot a video now since today is not a

10
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,490
regular day not to be making sort of a

11
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,700
regular vlog entry because Candis and I

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,840
are supposed to be out of town tonight I

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,450
offered my apartment our apartment to a

14
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,250
friend of mine now we're not gonna be

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,630
out of town so we're gonna be at the

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,950
apartment with my friend who's staying

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,630
there winner I thought I'd share a story

18
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,000
about my friend he was the guy who did

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,520
that ridiculous gainer off that cliff in

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,980
the devil's punchbowl

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,970
here's how I met Clint I was there with

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,560
a friend of mine named Graham grandma I

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,939
had been skiing out there something you

25
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,799
were at a bar we'd been drinking and we

26
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,869
hatched this harebrained scheme and

27
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,610
schemed to like travel to Africa and

28
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,740
climb Mount Kilimanjaro it was just one

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,820
of those things that you talk about if

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,929
you've been drinking a lot it seems like

31
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:04,929
a great idea Clint so we're going to

32
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,610
Tanzania to climb the tallest

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,349
freestanding mountain in the world

34
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:11,470
big Kilimanjaro so was my big brother

35
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,769
van Graham Clint and me traveling to

36
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,510
Africa to find the tallest freestanding

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:23,860
mountain on planet earth 5:30 in the

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,620
morning as our first night in Africa and

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,349
it just poured torrential rain all night

40
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:40,340
last night

41
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,440
and I've done some things in my life

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,690
well a lot of things we'll most things

43
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,130
including yesterday we missed our flight

44
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,690
from the airport I've done a lot of

45
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,550
things with zero preparation that I

46
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,989
probably shouldn't have been doing but

47
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,030
this one this tops them all

48
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,620
so our first day here we decided to

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,410
start the climb immediately so we're

50
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,930
headed to the mountain now pretty

51
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,849
exciting stuff pretty cool there's a

52
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,530
meat market across the street that has

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:14,410
the most pungent odor I've ever smelled

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,790
this is years and years you have no idea

55
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,670
how it works now but typically when

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,160
Westerners Gringo's travels to Tanzania

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,630
to climb this mountain there's a lot of

58
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,370
planning and preparation you hire

59
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,650
mountain guides like we did none of that

60
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,959
we just showed up and started asking

61
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,569
people in Tanzania how do we climb Mount

62
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,080
Kilimanjaro

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,090
[Music]

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,730
eventually we met these dudes they

65
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,500
seemed nice we paid them in dead

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:55,220
presidents stacks of $100 bills one of

67
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,170
the more jarring aspects of this climb

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,330
was we went with the dudes who are gonna

69
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,700
like carry our food up the mountain like

70
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,680
the porters and they showed us where

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,170
they were buying the meat now what so

72
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,550
terrifying about this is like we're

73
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,110
gonna spend ten days on a mountain

74
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,239
there's no refrigerators and this was

75
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,549
the meat that they were buying to feed

76
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,040
us picking up the meat then we're gonna

77
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,329
eat on our hike to the top of the

78
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:28,340
mountain here it is now

79
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:38,259
[Music]

80
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,720
the gods did were I think reputable but

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,009
yeah it was their idea to bring the

82
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:49,009
booze if ever you are fortunate you were

83
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,259
lucky enough to ever have the experience

84
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,330
or the opportunity to go I highly

85
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,860
recommend it like of all the things I've

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,449
done in my life and I'm very lucky to

87
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,849
have done a lot this is one of the most

88
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:08,360
magical where we know yeah so we're

89
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,620
halfway there in three hours

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,669
our first night is as if you're

91
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,590
experiencing every climate on planet

92
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,659
Earth inside of like a five day climb

93
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:27,259
first night went really well we're

94
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,150
packing up now it's 650 in the morning

95
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,560
morning boys this this is what our first

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,860
camp looked like that is not Kilimanjaro

97
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,580
my thumb is blocking the Sun day two is

98
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,949
Graham's birthday six we didn't have a

99
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,810
birthday cake but we did have a candy

100
00:05:50,810 --> 00:06:02,449
bar now I am extremely proud of the fact

101
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,340
that when I climbed aconcagua that is

102
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,919
the second tallest mountain of the seven

103
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,300
summit the tallest mountain in the

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,949
southern hemisphere a mountain that was

105
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,919
in 6,000 feet taller than Kilimanjaro I

106
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,169
did it with no porters no guides I

107
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,150
carried my own stuff but when you go up

108
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,370
Kilimanjaro you are required to hire

109
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,380
these dudes to carry your stuff porters

110
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,699
are carrying up all their gear but just

111
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,190
the sheer amount of their hearing but

112
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:38,340
seriously these dudes were so cool

113
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,410
on earth but we are way above the clouds

114
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,560
now as we got higher in altitude as it

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,290
got colder I got sicker and sicker I

116
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,250
this is cancer third day freezing out

117
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,930
here it could've been because I was

118
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,090
someone healthy back then or I have no

119
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,730
idea but I got so sick climbing this

120
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,010
mountain tomorrow morning we go from

121
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,310
there to there now I'm a pretty tough

122
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,490
guy and then I eat shrug off all the

123
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,320
altitude sickness and the cold and

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,790
whatever the hell else was wrong with me

125
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,590
but we had to wake up at 4 a.m. the day

126
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,570
we're doing this summit push and when I

127
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,720
woke up that morning I just some caution

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,850
I don't look good in this next shot it's

129
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,710
uh his last day I climb into the summit

130
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,850
in the morning it's about 20 below

131
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,590
freezing feeling strong but me I made it

132
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,570

we turn this in one of the episodes for

137
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,200
HBO show there's an amazing experience

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,030
like the last big adventure I went on my

139
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:04,210

144
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,629
the rest of that time in Africa we were

145
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,919
there for a couple more weeks just like

146
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:34,179
bopping around hands Ania

we're going to fly there was this time

150
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,399
we met this due to drop us off in a tiny

151
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,140
little Cessna airplane in the middle of

152
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,670
nowhere and we had to get a ride back on

153
00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:07,590
a tractor which took six hours

154
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,600
this is what it's like to get buzzed by

155
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,010
an airplane

156
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:23,730
[Music]

157
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:34,959
there were some great adventures I've

158
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,519
said this before I've said this on the

159
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,709
vlog before but when I was a little kid

160
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,199
my mom said to me spend your money on

161
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,559
things not trips cuz things last forever

162
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,769
and experiences don't and mom I could

163
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,740
not disagree with you more when I looked

164
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,779
at at the adventures I've taken in the

165
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,059
past I realized that they shaped me as a

166
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,019
human being

167
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,579
it was adventures like that spending

168
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:59,769
time with friends like Clint that made

169
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,990
me who I am but I look back at this like

170
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,879
I don't know what things I had in my

171
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,949
life then they're gone now but that

172
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,220
adventure that experience will be with

173
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,529
me forever it's the things in life that

174
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,259
are temporary the experiences are

175
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,570
forever you had it backwards

176
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:46,000
