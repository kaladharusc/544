1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,139
all in favor of prohibiting all future

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,190
movies from starting with a giant

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,719
eyeball cliche please say aye

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,089
or not I did I miss a row of judges

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,680
somewhere why is this upside down hang

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,150
and dismount so elaborate it doesn't

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,410
seem to serve any practical purpose and

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,520
there's not a single person around to

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,170
impress just slide down the damn rope

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,810
lure dead sprint or not did she just run

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,160
for like three seconds and then decide

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,810
to saunter is that the same artifact we

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,949
saw earlier yet it's in a completely

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,929
different room then why edit it in

15
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,550
earlier we shouldn't see it till she

16
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,380
does write praised creepy computerized

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,120
contraption can't course-correct current

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,070
cropped cropped coordinates classic good

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,420
to see the robot was at least programmed

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,770
with an acute sense of dramatic timing

21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,450
robot who punches through solid walls

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,460
now too weak to out arm Russell Angelina

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,050
Jolie seriously I've seen breadsticks

24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,640
with more girth than her arms there is

25
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,200
no possible way this robot can see this

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,840
but editors gotta edit I guess

27
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,890
apparently we were watching this movie

28
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,840
in tutorial mode all this time also this

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,460
was training isn't there a way to train

30
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,899
without destroying your entire facility

31
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,640
in your discount iron giant was it

32
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,469
programmed to stop before it took my

33
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,949
head off oh well and that would be a

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,619
yeah no someone went to the syndrome

35
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,420
school of testing things you said make

36
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,860
it more challenging are you kidding me

37
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,810
all she had to do was say stop when you

38
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,670
have a safe word it's all the exact same

39
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,740
level of challenging as in not live

40
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,159
rounds again Oh Simon my favorite part

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,119
of any installment of the Tomb Raider

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,460
video game franchise is the 1980s sitcom

43
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,470
running joke rapport between Laura and

44
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,119
Bryce considering Bryce's ability to

45
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,009
construct an immortal robot his talents

46
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,119
seemed to be wasted in his current

47
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,590
scenario of appealing to the quirks of

48
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,000
people that are stupid rich no one

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,740
showers like this except in movies and

50
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,270
Herbal Essence commercials at this point

51
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,040
I'm honestly not sure which this is also

52
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,110
what does a pg-13 shower scene do for

53
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,460
anyone in case you confused it with

54
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,610
Venice Nebraska the first day of the

55
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,130
planetary alignment and we are still no

56
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,259
nearer to discovering the location of

57
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,390
the key the trying to thwart planetary

58
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,920
assignment committee from the latest

59
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,479
James Bond movie was sent to the wrong

60
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,729
set we are working through things based

61
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,610
on ancient cosmological models do you

62
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,590
want t viruses cuz this is how you get T

63
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,600
viruses also it can't be stressed enough

64
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,219
that this is exactly the same character

65
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,689
he plays in Resident Evil extinction

66
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,250
he's the guy who has to find something

67
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,780
impossible for some shady organization

68
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,459
and it's getting blamed because he can't

69
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,230
find it what a weird typecasting

70
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,000
we will have our answer in time for the

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,040
relevant planetary alignment Tomb Raider

72
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
inspired so many planetary alignment

73
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,849
drinking games that DUI arrests tripled

74
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,769
in the summer of 2001 but I'm happy to

75
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,300
announce that we are almost ready

76
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,280
why is beardless jour as designated book

77
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
carrier even here the materials he's

78
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,459
carrying don't seem to be needed and

79
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,230
also aren't acquiring godlike power

80
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,000
meetings usually a fairly closed thing

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,950
in fact the sidekick will be so ignored

82
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,480
this entire film he'd be better labeled

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,550
as a side stand so we will have

84
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,200
possession of the key in one week one

85
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,849
week even though this time parameter was

86
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,440
never brought up in the entirety of this

87
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,030
every evil person in the world bored me

88
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,390
we have only a single opportunity to

89
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,060
retrieve the two halves of the triangle

90
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,579
and if we hey we must wait another five

91
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,480
thousand years

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,000
echoey exposition acquisition egypt

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,459
again it's nothing but pyramids and sand

94
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,670
I know gets everywhere in the cracks if

95
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,989
anyone was wondering why the Egyptian

96
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,579
Tourism Board decided not to sponsor

97
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,579
this film I miss you daddy and this

98
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,140
would mark the first time Angelina Jolie

99
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,670
has said those words in regard to Jon

100
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,319
Voight also Richard Croft died exactly

101
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,790
20 years ago to the day of this

102
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,010
planetary alignment on top of that JFK

103
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,420
was released ten years prior to Tomb

104
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,100
Raider and 17 years prior the

105
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,480
Ghostbusters informed us that cats and

106
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,739
dogs will be living together causing

107
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,030
mass hysteria so with all that

108
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,920
information we can conclude that two of

109
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,540
those films are good when is the Eclipse

110
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,209
in one week from today but there is

111
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,549
plenty to look out for until then equip

112
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,760
shadowing the exact alignment of planets

113
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,380
necessary to activate triangle only

114
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,640
occurs once every 5,000 years

115
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,370
listen Lara Croft to blow up and to find

116
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,690
it too bad we didn't get to see any

117
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,460
scenes of teenage Lauren whining about

118
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,600
how she doesn't want to be a worldwide

119
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,130
adventure seeker when she grows up she

120
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,720
just wants to cut hair also dream

121
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,550
splaining well we now know why Laura is

122
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,080
single first off she's an independent

123
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
woman who doesn't need a man second she

124
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,170
stabbed her last five boyfriends to

125
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,340
death in their sleep movie will

126
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,020
continually give us unnecessary POV

127
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,490
shots because the thing we all love

128
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,900
about video games is walking through

129
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,700
hallways this movie focuses so much

130
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,140
attention on Laura's breasts I think if

131
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,250
they had just called this movie Laura

132
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,690
Croft twin Raiders no one would have

133
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,650
blinked an eye seems like a pretty

134
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,480
drastic move but since Laura thinks she

135
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,919
hears ticking she's probably feeling a

136
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,440
bit clock blocked we have 82 rooms why

137
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,730
can't you live in the house probably

138
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,320
because it makes the robot orgies he's

139
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,610
obviously been having a little less

140
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,250
awkward for everyone involved this works

141
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,110
also this hammering scene will require

142
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,640
forward cutaways all of which piss me

143
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,940

accidentally bidding at auctions is not

only unbinding it's almost impossible

151
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,380
auctioneers are as skilled at

00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,030

motorcycle trip and another a car trip

169
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,169
she nearly brought photographs it's also

170
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,760
an amazing coincidence the Powell is

171
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,050
going to have the key fall right in his

172
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,640
lap a couple days after being threatened

173
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,680
by the old evil people committee this is

174
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,380
a pleasurable torment my ignorant amuses

175
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,510
me man Fred Powell's dialogue sounds as

176
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,729
if Emily Bronte and f scott Fitzgerald

177
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,470
had a three-way with Aurel Stein unjam

178
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,060
up a jumpring since they clearly have no

179
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,320
issue killing Laura why wouldn't they

180
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,520
have just killed Bryce instead of

181
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,050
locking him up inside his trailer where

182
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,340
does this bullet come from that it only

183
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,840
manages to hit the can and nothing else

184
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,470
on the desk

185
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,240
including Bryce not one of these hookers

186
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,650
has been able to even Nick Laura with a

187
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,330
bullet is this the Dollar General of hit

188
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,010
squats it took Hillary that long to put

189
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,070
on a vest and some slippers

190
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,710
of course Lara is in the exact place is

191
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,419
the phone when you call and at the exact

192
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,860
time you decide to call her because yeah

193
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,870
movies movie establishes the shot of all

194
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,130
the car keys falling down

195
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,020
however Laura still only has two hands

196
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,580
how is she getting every car to go off

197
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,080
at the same time just cut from her

198
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,669
running to her sliding and then another

199
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,380
cut to grabbing the gun from bad guy

200
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,759
then three cups of her getting up off

201
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,169
the slide then about five more cuts of

202
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,729
running and bad guys till she somehow it

203
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,139
gets to a motorcycle hood it's been

204
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,460
confusing to the audience and a little

205
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,289
over the place and there's loud music

206
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:27,970
bullets firing and she's all jiggly in

207
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,100
her PJ's who will even care cinemasins

208
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,740
cares mother farts cinemasins cares with

209
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,849
time of the essence our protagonist

210
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,949
wastes three seconds doing a full 360

211
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,270
doughnut instead of actually heroic

212
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,250
because reasons is this mess really what

213
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,289
counts is editing in 2001 the shooter is

214
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,970
shooting up to the right yet when we

215
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,979
quick cut to jolie she's also shooting

216
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,180
to the right and later he's still

217
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,440
obviously on the left if you're gonna

218
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,060
give us an epileptic seizure with the

219
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,470
cutting at least have the decency to get

220
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,849
the geography sort of correct why is

221
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,080
this still sitting on the table with

222
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,430
clock pieces around it we've already

223
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,810
seen that she took it to her clock

224
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,610
friend so why wouldn't she have locked

225
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,039
it away afterwards I think gone hero

226
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,360
never misses unless they accidentally

227
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,340
shoot at a friend cliched this editing

228
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,020
ten full seconds a hallway walking with

229
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,460
three different angles seriously I've

230
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,990
seen snapchats from middle schoolers

231
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,669
with more restraint lawyers note I have

232
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,169
never received a snapchat from a middle

233
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:19,840
schooler UPS driver casually enters a

234
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,130
home without being invited because

235
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,229
apparently what brown can do for you is

236
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:24,909
invade your privacy and judge your mess

237
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,409
also that concludes the always

238
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,820
compelling people delivering things to

239
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,139
other people's section of the movie with

240
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,580
the bad guys delivering the triangle

241
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,870
piece and now this letter with

242
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,070
absolutely nothing else important

243
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,380
happening by donning dota I knew you

244
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,570
figure this out how he was gonna have a

245
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,340
post deceased letter sent why not just

246
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,930
explain everything there instead of some

247
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,310
random William Blake quote that would

248
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,810
hopefully lead her to ripping up the

249
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,870
first edition text and I miss you and

250
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,360
love you always and forever movie takes

251
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
the old letter being read in the voice

252
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,240
of a person who wrote a trope up a notch

253
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,560
by actually showing footage of the

254
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
character saying it which makes no sense

255
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
because who's he saying it to us

256
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,349
strangest fourth wall break ever by now

257
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:00,729
I'm sure you would have discovered the

258
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,620
clock I concede it might take a weirdly

259
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,000
specific dream to wake you up in the

260
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,860
middle of the night but by Gauri Olaf

261
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,870
found it it gave its possessive apothem

262
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,560
could be used

263
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,139
good great evil so basically like all

264
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,940
technology then all power can be used

265
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,690
for good or evil

266
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,490
we get it stop Uncle Ben eNOS Hollywood

267
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,960
also I want to point out again how

268
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,820
fucking lucky Richard is that Laura is

269
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,590
both alive and willing to follow in her

270
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,430
father's footsteps

271
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,960
I mean we're resting the fate of the

272
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,760
world on some very specific instances to

273
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,900
happen over the next 20 years

274
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,380
devious dangerous men and women find and

275
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,010
destroy both halves of the trial now

276
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,120
that we are finally finished with this

277
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,890
in-game cutscene can Laura please go on

278
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,050
her mission quest faint Furious 7 could

279
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,029
have gone back a scant 14 years to

280
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,950
realize how stupid an idea it is to put

281
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,659
parachutes on vehicles these binoculars

282
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,010
literally come with a zoom and enhance

283
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,350
cliche built right in we have 72 minutes

284
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,570
to the next alignment we have to work

285
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,370
faster maybe not having your men Hall

286
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,810
Powell's personal couch on this journey

287
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,279
would have shaped off some final minutes

288
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,260
this is not how close the planets are to

289
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,589
each other

290
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,270
also which planets are these even

291
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,620
supposed to be this can't be Earth

292
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,880
because there are only two planets

293
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,260
between Earth and the Sun are those

294
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,000
rings is this supposed to be Saturn

295
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,560
because my very educated mother just

296
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,240
served us noodles and something isn't

297
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,980
quite lining up here's Alex helping pull

298
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,750
down the statue with the rope and here

299
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,370
he is just seconds later routing himself

300
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,480
on from the front are we in the

301
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,860
multiplicity expanded universe now

302
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,330
Laura's overrated

303
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,790
she's good don't get me wrong but she's

304
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,920
in it for the glory whereas I'm in it

305
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,550
for the money

306
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,870
considering Laura clearly doesn't need

307
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,520
money this seems like a bizarre thing to

308
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,110
be bringing up into the belly of the

309
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,750
beast and out of the demons ass

310
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,550
I'll take rejected Taco Bell slogans for

311
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,560
500 Alex Tomb Raider got a head start on

312
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,180
the Jay horror trend that would begin in

313
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,520
2002 by adding some ghost girls to these

314
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
ancient ruins why the fuck is this

315
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,790
little ghost girl helping Laura does she

316
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,110
know Laura's a good person why would

317
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,460
anyone help Laura when the triangles

318
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,420
supposed to be hidden from humans

319
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,900
forever

320
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,700
what is this glow stick for she planning

321
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,500
on starting a rave because this room is

322
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,960
already helot to receive the gift of

323
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,850
heaven mind you they probably can't hear

324
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,950
you down below but why transit we have

325
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,380
two minutes mr. West you'll the Tomb

326
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,060
Raider figure it out

327
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,380
so we're just going with Tomb Raider as

328
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,550
a legitimate thing you would call a

329
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,709
person why not archaeologist or simply

330
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,600
you're the expert mr. West

331
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,110
Tempus Fugit yes time flies thanks for

332
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,670
the translation Laura I'm not sure why

333
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,080
man for it felt the need to speak in

334
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,670
Latin all of a sudden he placed the

335
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,279
clock here at the exact moment of a lion

336
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,020
attack I'm confused why did the

337
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,339
Illuminati go through the trouble of

338
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:19,870
burying the triangle on two ends of the

339
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,280
earth but still give people the chance

340
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,420
to dig it up later also

341
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,100
under these rules how is anyone supposed

342
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,750
to figure out the exact alignment when

343
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,459
they're deep down inside this room back

344
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,779
in the day that these ancient people

345
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,250
live there was no way of knowing the

346
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,899
exact time without looking at the Sun or

347
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,310
stars or something how do you see those

348
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,500
things from here also also five thousand

349
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,760
years ago they could not have known that

350
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,320
airplanes would exist and that getting

351
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,610
the two ends of the earth within a week

352
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,260
would be possible and we find out later

353
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,519
this time-travel thing only goes into

354
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,850
the past forty one forty Alec stops

355
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,440
counting at thirty two and after a

356
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
minute of conversation he then starts

357
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,490
off at twelve eleven yeah sounds about

358
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,959
right Laura definitely missed her chance

359
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,850
to jump on this log in time but the

360
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,410
movie lies to us and tells us she made

361
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,329
the jump successfully also what a ripoff

362
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,190
the people of light rigged this book so

363
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,570
that people who were smart enough could

364
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,070
get the triangle but apparently you have

365
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,180
to do a lot of the work yourself

366
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,430
Manfred sees the CGI stone man throwing

367
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,839
the sword at this distance and can

368
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,940
easily dodge it but to science I'm a bad

369
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,740
guy I'll use one of my employees as a

370
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,600
human shield instead Elle he even does

371
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,100
this very thing the next time one of

372
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,779
them throws a sim car at him also how

373
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,010
exactly were these very slow

374
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,870
uncoordinated bunched into one corner

375
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,639
bad guys supposed to kill anyone you

376
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,720
could simply just run away from the

377
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,160
Frank Powell's many years of training

378
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,480
and defensive tactics against

379
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,190
resurrected God statues it's finally

380
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,899
paid off why is this statue polished

381
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,130
here and not killing her all right

382
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,750
because this movie is Indiana Jones and

383
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,550
to ripoff another classic scene got it

384
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,829
well I surely didn't think this would be

385
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,750
necessary I was just hanging back and

386
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,279
watching my ancient magic stone men get

387
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,690
destroyed and figured at least one of

388
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,680
them would be able to kill you guys

389
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
guess not we interrupt this obvious boss

390
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,100
battle to remind Hollywood that just

391
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,390
because the property is based on a video

392
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,890
game doesn't mean you have to have video

393
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,540
game mechanics you're making a movie now

394
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,220
moving it up already there's so much

395
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,630
whatever going on here that I'm just

396
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,269
gonna add 20 cents for smashing seams

397
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm level pegging with mr. pal

398
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,529
oh man level pegging is so hard to do

399
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,240
also do you happen to have footage I can

400
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,470
study in 66 hours and 53 minutes of

401
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,819
spike movies imperative time crunch

402
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,500
message we have time for scenes like

403
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,449
powell getting massaged or laura Horning

404
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,640
up a bunch of Cambodian monks your

405
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,760
father said you will never give up knew

406
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,480
my father

407
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,699
that's coincidental as hell sure but how

408
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,079
did he know this was Richard Crofts

409
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,209
daughter since even if he met her it

410
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,230
would have been over 20 years ago

411
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,000
by the way I know her dad told her as a

412
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
kid to find this triangle of power thing

413
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,569
and so she thinks she needs to find it

414
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,490
just from a pure curiosity standpoint I

415
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,079
can see why you'd want it but unless

416
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,339
she's planning on traveling through time

417
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,720
which is what this triangle apparently

418
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,889
lets you do why would she

419
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,869
the sky she could technically win this

420
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,670
movie by flying to Wolverines cabin in

421
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,989
Canada and hiding out until the

422
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:42,639
planetary alignment is over you always

423
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,100
be Illuminati it's no such thing

424
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,569
anyway now see Lara seems to be of the

425
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,589
belief that if someone tells you

426
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:52,149
something isn't true then you just throw

427
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,199
a knife to make it true

428
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,819
conveniently placed decorative railing

429
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:56,470
thankfully prevents us from seeing Alex

430
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,779
West's double O seven inches Wow

431
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,639
time to save universe again then is it

432
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,989
considering we've never seen them save

433
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,459
the universe once this seems more like

434
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,199
dialogue for a sequel than an initial

435
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,089
outing it bums going to sleep again

436
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,699
down the left cheek really fascinating

437
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,649
to be fair no less fascinating than the

438
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,329
majority of this movie no seriously are

439
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,220
you confusing Siberia with any other

440
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,319
foreign country Siberia is as synonymous

441
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,119
with Russia as election meddling or

442
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,569
collusion

443
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:21,549
welcome to the dead Sam if Christopher

444
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,139
Walken popped up right now I'd take off

445
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,730
at least five sins they've traveled

446
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,079
across the world to find a slightly more

447
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,269
advanced airport security scanner it's a

448
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,259
Time storm time is broken here and you

449
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,389
know this how exactly did you go to Time

450
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,129
storm school are you an official time

451
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,109
meteorologist now fifty bucks says the

452
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,059
pieces inside the Sun Alex decides to

453
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,230
play the game of who's got the bigger

454
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,480
Raider so the Illuminati really wanted

455
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,860
some asshole to jump around on this

456
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,059
structure and go through all this bullsh

457
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,889
just to use the key I'm still really

458
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:49,209
unclear as to why they made it possible

459
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,649
to find the thing they didn't want found

460
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,119
but then putting people through this

461
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,799
convoluted nonsense just so we're clear

462
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,540
due to their slightly different orbital

463
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,189
planes the planets lining up in three

464
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,929
dimensions like this is astronomically

465
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,669
impossible well someone please remind me

466
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,559
exactly why mrs. Bob Thornton cares

467
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,029
about this guy again all you've seen in

468
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,529
the movie is animosity and accusation

469
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,149
yet now she's all in trying to save him

470
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,860
considering no electronics work here

471
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,929
because it's a dead zone what kind of

472
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,489
voodoo magic is in this laser sight that

473
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:15,120
allows it to work you

474
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,260
how does she know how to do any of this

475
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,730
it's not like this has ever been done

476
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,300
before

477
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,770
you can't just Google a walkthrough and

478
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,450
some cheat codes in real life but in the

479
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,580
unholy cuz this you could have written

480
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,380
in your gems he most definitely could

481
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,300
have but instead chose to leave weird

482
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,890
quotes from poems and hope you would

483
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,210
somehow figure out how to do all this

484
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,520
why can't we use just this once

485
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,910
we can't change time bullsh

486
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,560
we know she's gonna use it to save Alex

487
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,940
so she could absolutely use it to save

488
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,320
you while you're at it maybe you can go

489
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,550
back and keep Michael Bay from the

490
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,470
Transformers franchise priorities void

491
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,080
priorities miss destroy the tribe in the

492
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,340
letter you gave Lauren why didn't you

493
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,020
just tell her to destroy the clock game

494
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,790
over nobody ever gets the triangle

495
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,140
without the clock so why go through all

496
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,120
this this is one of the most unthought

497
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,830
out endings to a movie ever made a

498
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,360
minute does she have control of how much

499
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,920
time she can go back is she doing this

500
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,180
with her mind how the fuck does this

501
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,830
time-travel thing even work if this is a

502
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,090
matter of strength I'm pretty sure you

503
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,740
can exact the same amount of force with

504
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,180
a flat palm against the flat side of the

505
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,010
blade but hey if you'd rather Rob Roy

506
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,480
yet and slice up your palms you do you

507
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,840
boo

508
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,370
look if this knife still has all its

509
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,750
forward momentum to the point that it's

510
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,490
shaking in midair then I don't know how

511
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,810
turning it around is gonna make it fly

512
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,400
in another direction it should just fall

513
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
into the ground right he's seen

514
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,470
particularly concerned that I shouldn't

515
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,940
take this so was pal been holding this

516
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,530
watch back in his bag of tricks to use

517
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,000
just in case he gets stabbed and left

518
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,210
for dead by Laura alright no he's coming

519
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,220
down get the motivator you just hurry

520
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,230
yeah speaking of hurrying in the time

521
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,250
that it took you to have this

522
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,540
conversation she could have run down

523
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,100
grab the watch and already been out but

524
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,720
by all means please converse slowly in

525
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
the disintegrating tomb you've been

526
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,630
rated look no matter what this movie

527
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,430
says this dudes been doing nothing that

528
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,900
would make us think he's a badass we've

529
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,370
seen him meditating getting massages

530
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,020
sitting down while others do work and

531
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,480
absolutely zero ab crunches so fuck off

532
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,340
Tomb Raider has the audacity to spoil

533
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,050
who actually did indeed let the dogs out

534
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,210
oh my god thank Christ the Tomb Raider

535
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,680
finally addressed the notion that Laura

536
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,360
never wears a dress because I would have

537
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,350
just left the movie pissed off that

538
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,610
there was no resolution to this

539
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,650
storyline to be the guy that has never

540
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,800
been able to top Conair

541
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,930
the fate of billions will depend upon

542
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:30,569
you but she's in it for the glory

543
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,189
whereas I'm in it for the money he's in

544
00:16:33,189 --> 00:17:02,790
it for the money not science mr. Powell

545
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,250
your explanation for this is I propose

546
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,370
that we end the world the names bond

547
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,829
James Bond

548
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:17,790
it's adventure time

549
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:23,000
