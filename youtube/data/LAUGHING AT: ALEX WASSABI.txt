00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,420

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,610

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,729
serious when someone puts their emotion

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,580

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,630
just he doesn't take me seriously

41
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,430
damn right I don't take you seriously

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:15,890
you flip slowly piece of shit so I'm

43
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,870
sorry I'm sorry I mean obviously he was

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,520
pissed at me for not taking them

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,920
seriously but I mean come on how can I

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,959
take this seriously

47
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,150
either way he responded to my reaction

48
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,070
and said this let me hit you with this

49
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,160
enjoy let me hop on a plane come to

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,930
London oh we can have a little sparring

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,970
match just me and you let me train a

52
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,400
little bit I'll come through we can see

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,299
what's up no cameras no vlogs no nothing

54
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,160
it's just a little a little sparring

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,170
match to see where we match up but I

56
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,239
ignored him I wasn't gonna waste my time

57
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,000
I wasn't going to entertain his bullshit

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
so I moved on he was doing terribly in

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,650
the voting system that I made anyway

60
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,630
then obviously Logan pole came into the

61
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,790
equation and since I wanted to find him

62
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,340
or Jake initially clearly guava juice

63
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,709
his shadow felt some sort of way about

64
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,560
this and came out with this these guys

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,170
think they're smart these guys think

66
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,390
they can fool the world I'm talking

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,940

106
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,240
always got to say I have not trained for

107
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,789
boxing in months and there's a reason

108
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,440
for that it's because I'm not getting

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,870
paid to fight I do not get any profits

110
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,900
from any tickets sold for this fight I'm

111
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,060
not competing for a belt or a

112
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,300
championship no views or subs will come

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,990
to me from any of this uni

114
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,440

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,720
let me train a little bit I'll come

116
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,780
through we can see what's up no cameras

117
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,940
no vlogs no nothing oh no cameras no

118
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,190
vlogs no nothing

119
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,400
now that I wait one more time no cameras

120
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,620
no fog no nothing I don't know about you

121
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,680
but it sounds like you are contradicting

122
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,690
yourself before you want to disbar me

123
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,090
with no cameras or anything but now

124
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,160
since you know that you fucked up you

125
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,210
don't want to spoil me

126
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,310
unless there's cameras loads and on top

127
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,500
of that money

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,470
Alex you're hilarious

129
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,210
what was even more funny was that you

130
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,120
started brown-nosing Logan JJ what do

131
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,710
you think you're doing bro you're come

132
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:31,910
again Logan you don't have a chance

133
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,010
against Logan I have a hundred percent

134
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,630
sure that when you called out the pole

135
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,400
brothers at the end of your first boxing

136
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,040
match you were hoping praying wishing

137
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,710
for Jake please didn't get Jake not Big

138
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:50,510
Boy Logan Logan let me tell you

139
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,140
something he doesn't stop he was in the

140
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,620
gym every single day he would be there

141
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,380
when I showed up at the gym to workout

142
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,300
and he would still be there after I left

143
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,430
sometimes I would go to the gym at like

144
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,450
1:00 in the morning

145
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,250
because I had a busy day and he would

146
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,080
already be there I'm uh stopping here

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,910
because he goes on for quite a few

148
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,000
minutes just repeatedly sucking Logan's

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,020
dick Oh Alex

150
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,990
what do you he's not human I just not he

151
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,390
goes overboard with everything he done

152
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,760
what the fuck we get it get off his dick

153
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,169
are you trying to get a kebab or

154
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,750
something hold it shit anyway like I was

155
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,850
saying he was one of the top fighters in

156
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,320
the world man he started killing it on

157
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,190
Instagram

158
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,440
he made his way over to YouTube and

159
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,050
within a year what are you sliding off

160
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,080
Logan literally a few months ago telling

161
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
him that the whole boxing thing is fake

162
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,030
why are you sucking him off now Jesus

163
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,210
Christ Alex no clout and if we sparred

164
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,320
you'd be even more butters

165
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,150
