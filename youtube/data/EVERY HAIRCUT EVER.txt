1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,639
Hmm...feels pretty good

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:09,309
I wanna close my eyes, but will that make it look like I like it too much?  I don't want to make eye contact though.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,900
Don't moan, Ian do not moan!

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,440
There's no way she heard that right, I mean the waters kind of loud and...

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Yeah! Okay. I'm sure this happens all the time. I can't be the only guy who

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,269
God!

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,110
Oh, oh ( Really, man :) )

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:41,200
What was that? (wtf?) nothing, keep going please.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,560
Every haircut ever.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,460
So how's your day going? I'm so sorry, I don't really want to talk while I'm getting my hair cut.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,430
I Toooootally get you. Do not worry. Having a stranger yammering at you and you're gonna relax it's totally the worst.

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,300
Especially when I have a job to do, and, it's like, you don't want them to get distracted. You're like 'Hello

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm here to get my hair cut not be your therapist.'

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,559
And plus I had a really bad day yesterday (so...?)

15
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,559
So I don't even want to talk like my uncle's kicking me out of his house

16
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,580
and when I say house

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,110
I mean I've been living in his shed for like three months and like technically I'm gonna be a homeless by Friday (just don't Courtney...)

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,439
So, you know,Oh my god! I mean, I know right it's like come on. Oh my GOD!

19
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,580
Wow, you really get me do you only get coffee after this?

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,970
Men's haircuts are $18 and women's are 49?

21
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,070
Okay, girl. What is we doing today?

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,040
So, I just kind of went through a really rough breakup. So I'm looking for a big change

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,030
Oh no, baby, what happened?

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,956
I found out he cheated on me.

25
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:34,646
Oh, so we doing some bang

26
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:35,623
with my sister

27
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:36,809
and a new collar?

28
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:41,080
And He Had A Whole Secret Family!!!!!

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:48,289
Girl don't you worry. I know just what you need

30
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:52,490
And done (wtf?)

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,600
It's perfect(?)

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,020
I'm gonna burn them all!!    (okay!!)

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,280
Hold on. Wait?

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,700

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,437
Wow. This looks amazing. Thank you.

Yeah. You're welcome

37
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,760
(Laughs)

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Hey, it's gonna look like crap in two days when I try to style it myself, huh? (yep)

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,820
Absolutely!

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,930
Yeah, I'll take a number two on the sides and a number one on the top

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,790
What can we do for you fella?

42
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,064
Well, I wanted my hair line dumped but where is the old barbershop?

43
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,400
They moved out and we moved in
