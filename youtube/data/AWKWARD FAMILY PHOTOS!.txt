can't that baby's face is so happy

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,930
though and that's all that matters

60
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,560
honestly honestly that's all that

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,519
matters it's it's a hard-knock life okay

62
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,549
what is this a family portrait yo for

63
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:32,819
real

64
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:39,629
it's like he's drying oh no there's a

65
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,280
pumpkin oh oh I get it okay so let me

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,479
tell you the first thing that came

67
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,129
across my mind I thought he was drawing

68
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,489
that pumpkin on there and I thought the

69
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,109
pumpkin needs like you know usually you

70
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,449
smash a pumpkin so I'm assuming he's

71
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,469
just gonna like people usually smash

72
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,579
pumpkins with like you know baseball

73
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,069
bats and that's the joke I thought that

74
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,040
was going on here but looking a little

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,139
bit closer he's not going to smash his

76
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,609
baby and his girlfriend his wife

77
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,509
girlfriend stomach he has a knife in his

78
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:16,799
hand carving the pumpkin I get it I

79
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,269
understand I understand it you have not

80
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,860
fooled me yet I understand it completely

81
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,080
because she's older she's like

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,460
now wants to get a c-section or

83
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,069
something because that would make sense

84
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,080
I mean why else would they take this

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,689
photo that'd be kind of like weird that

86
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,909
would be pretty weird family photo all

87
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,909
right look at that parrot though I don't

88
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,729
have too much to say about this one

89
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,900
other than white America that's what

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,879
this photos I see this photo and that's

91
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,349
the first thing I think of is white

92
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,469
America these people are like white

93
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:02,580
America I don't even know I don't what

94
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,889
is this what is this family they have a

95
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:05,819
freaking llama

96
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,830
they have a freaking llama at their

97
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,080
photo shoot and a pig they must live on

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,750
a farm they look like farmers

99
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,430
they look like farmers but you're taking

100
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,330
a photo you're taking a photo you're

101
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,569
taking a freaking photo of your llama of

102
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:28,860
your freaking llama taking a photo of

103
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,819
your llama mean that's definitely

104
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:41,300
interesting okay okay um

105
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:50,969

115
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,940
whoever a photographer that allowed this

116
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:31,529
I have a migraine now who why it's like

117
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,810
you can do so many other things at a

118
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,740
photo shoot you really can it's it's not

119
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,240
that hard to think of it or not

120
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,060
different ideas

121
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,370
I mean they're family you know all

122
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,530
innocent and stuff but I don't know I

123
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,810
could think of a million until more

124
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,060
appropriate family photos like yeah

125
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,710

126
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,240

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,050
I don't even know how every person in

128
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,419

131
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,050
compared to the other one except this

132
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,880
one those two dogs look like they are

133

literally wanna kill each other

134
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,370
those two dogs if you let them down will

135
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,310
probably kill each other and they find

136
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,000
entertainment off that what is wrong

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,880
