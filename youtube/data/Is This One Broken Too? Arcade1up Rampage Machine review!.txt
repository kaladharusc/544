1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,680
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,179
YouTube look at you 98 coming at your

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,500
levels again through the power of the

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,240
internet and I got a shipment from the

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,030
folks over arcade one up and I have a

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,830
story to tell you but first let me show

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,750
you what they sent yep this looks like

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,849
one of the fully assembled arcade

9
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,160
cabinets for review which is what they

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
said they would send me I'm not sure

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,410
which one that says I think it might be

12
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,320
the rampage slash dowsed one but before

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,970
we crack into this I have to say some

14
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,189
really bad stuff about a arcade one up

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,689
and then I'll say thank you for the cool

16
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,550
machine they sent so if you didn't see

17
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,660
my last review video of my deluxe arcade

18
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,989
asteroids slash centipede machine I need

19
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,129
you to know this because I reached out

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,300
to the company to talk to them about it

21
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,980
I'm still kind of upset about it so let

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,840
me show you what the problem was so here

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,789
is my deluxe machine and as you can see

24
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,289
it's got games on it like tempest that

25
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,059
require a spinner

26
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,399
now I'm gonna say that I have played the

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,660
buttons quite a bit and the buttons are

28
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,730
stiff but I liked them the trackball is

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,460
decent it's not amazing it's definitely

30
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,079
not as spinny as I would like it to be

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,210
but it's good the spinner

32
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,010
however for tempest and other games like

33
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,850
it absolute garbage and I contacted the

34
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,990
company to talk to them about that

35
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,920
that's why they offered a different

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
machine for review but I wanted to

37
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,580
include in this review that you do not

38
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,140
want to buy the deluxe machine because

39
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,990
this spinner is awful terrible terrible

40
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,299
spinner and also the our asteroid

41
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,040
machine artists are the the centipede

42
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,229
machine the tempest machine that uses

43
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,090
this spinner on it you don't want that

44
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,970
machine avoid that machine now the good

45
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,920
news is when I contacted arcade went up

46
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,299
and I told him about the problem they

47
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,770
admitted that they knew there is a

48
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,850
problem with the spinner that it would

49
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,100
put the 2019 versions of the machines

50
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,570
would have much better spinners as well

51
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,240
you can loosen up the spinner by opening

52
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,890
it up and make it a little bit better

53
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,899
so on and so forth they apologized they

54
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,640
told me how to fix the problem and they

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,439
said that they will fix it moving

56
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,960
forward but that said it sounds like to

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,009
me that you were aware that that was

58
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,420
probably not the highest quality spinner

59
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,149
when they release the machine I think

60
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,110
that kind of sucks so hopefully in the

61
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,219
Machine they sent me for review this

62
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,229
time is a little bit better but I can

63
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,759
absolutely tell you if you want to play

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,860
Tempest you don't want to buy that

65
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,810
arcade cabinet ok problem number one we

66
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,759
just realized that when they dropped

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,069
this off it was upside down so hopefully

68
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,200
nothing in here is damaged I can't

69
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,720
believe you PS shipped it upside down

70
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,800
secondly please keep in mind

71
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,120
when you get your machine it's going to

72
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,440
come in a flat pallet you need to put it

73
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,400
together it's got about a 30 minute

74
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,230
assembly time you can refer to my other

75
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,520
arcade 1up video to see what it's like

76
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,250
oh my first impression of this rampage

77
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,050
machine pretty sexy here it is fully

78
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,700
assembled out of the box we shot to take

79
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,170
it out of the foam and the plastic but

80
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,230
main it they all ship like this there'd

81
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,430
be another hundred dollars because the

82
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,600
shipping and cost and everything but

83
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,120
honestly man who's so much easier if you

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,690
just unbox it just start playing and

85
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,890
what am i complaining about they send

86
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,480
this one for review though so can't

87
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,340
complain too much for those of you enjoy

88
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,270
this kind of thing here we go oh yeah

89
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,810
there we go nice clean screen yeah oh

90
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,490
man that goes right down it goes right

91
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,100
down into that assembly this is the

92
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,420
problem I'm assembling it for you I

93
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,760
guess alright now look at this cabinet I

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,410
don't remember the original rampage like

95
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,360
controllers but this looks really good I

96
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,280
mean obviously you got to climb to jump

97
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,220
the punch but this I mean this these

98
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,080
arcade sticks are incredible that the

99
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,180
glass looks amazing look at look at the

100
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,360
art on this and the marquee is fantastic

101
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,220
I do wish these marquees lit up I mean

102
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,980
overall this is really really gorgeous

103
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,800
machine

104
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,030
hey I can't wait to play let's get let's

105
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,020
get this hooked up because I want to see

106
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,570
how a place now this one did not come

107
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,010
with the riser remember the riser is an

108
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,560
optional thing and it cost 30 bucks so

109
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,450
to give you an idea of a height

110
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,030
comparison that is quite the difference

111
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,520
there for sure absolutely big difference

112
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,870
between misshape there's no way I'm

113
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,040
going to be playing this rampage alone

114
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,030
without setting down so let's sit down

115
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,130
alright second impression here is I want

116
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,580
you to realize how small this controller

117
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,190
is this is built for three players now I

118
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,630
think I can easily set over here to the

119
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,980
side and play I think somebody else

120
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,090
could easily set over here to the side

121
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,560
and play you're gonna have to have a

122
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,620
child to play the middle person here

123
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,209
there's very little room let me show you

124
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,140
what I mean I mean look I'm as I'm wider

125
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,790
than this cabinet just me and obviously

126
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,769
I'm a very large person but even if I'm

127
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,769
all the way over here trying to

128
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,210
and someone's all the way over here

129
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,610
trying who's sitting here who is I'm

130
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,229
glad to put three controllers revenue I

131
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,720
really appreciate it

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,520
but come on it's this needed to be twice

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,800
as wide for that to ever happen but I

134
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,660
think two players is doable especially

135
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,800
since the controls are all the way over

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,289
here

137
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,610
yeah no way I'm just I'm in the play

138
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,280
like this here are the games that are

139
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,810
included in this one we have rampage

140
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,449
gauntlet Gauss and the fitter now these

141
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,789
are four really good games and the

142
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,990
retail on this box is about 300 bucks so

143
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,340
hmm

144
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,720
let's power it up now let's play some

145
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,569
games there we go oh I got a little

146
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,539
worried there for a second so rampage

147
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,039
along with gauntlet

148
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,139
two of my favorite corner monsters I did

149
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:11,810
enjoy them both quite a bit I have to

150
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,199
say looking at this looks really really

151
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
good the screen looks amazing

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,310
I don't know what it is I maybe it's the

153
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,470
way they've emulated it or already this

154
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,169
looks just like the arcade machine which

155
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:25,310
is really funny because when I try to

156
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,719
emulate this game anywhere else it

157
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,909
doesn't maybe they match the resolution

158
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,930
maybe I honestly don't know what is it

159
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,659
that makes this game looks so good

160
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,490
compared to other arcade games or other

161
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,599
ways to do it I tried to play rampage on

162
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,190
televisions before and and enemy

163
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,830
emulators before and it never looks this

164
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,810
good why don't I don't know what it is

165
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,110
but they sure got it right good job

166
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,120
arcade 1up beautiful I think this is the

167
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,620
one that most people are gonna buy this

168
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,110
cabinet for everybody's gonna want to

169
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,280
play gauntlet and being able to play

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,900
three player gauntlet it's probably a

171
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,680
really really cool thing now whether or

172
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,610
not you're gonna be able to fit three

173
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,259
people here is a whole other thing but

174
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,340
will you be able to play all the

175
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,169
different classes on one controller

176
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,090
there's four different classes this game

177
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,340
is originally meant to have four players

178
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,990
so explain to me how this is gonna work

179
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,449
on a three player setup okay I figured

180
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,789
it out this is not a four player version

181
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:24,050
of gauntlet this is the two-player

182
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,400
version of gauntlet and you can actually

183
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,440
just pick you can actually just pick

184
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,300
your class by pressing up down left and

185
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,460
right this I had seen a two-player

186
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,870
version of gauntlet in the arcades and

187
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,660
that's what this is no surprise here

188
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,830
what is surprising though is that has

189
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,720
set up for three players and they went

190
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,940
with the two-player version of the game

191
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,990
which I guess was the cheapest and

192
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,390
fastest and easiest solution but I'd

193
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,620
like I said I don't think you were able

194
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,030
to fit three people at this thing anyway

195
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,700
so just like every emulated version of

196
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,200
gauntlet it kind of takes the fun out of

197
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,020
it because you can just add quarters to

198
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,240
max out your health and you can add as

199
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,670
many quarters as you want so I'm

200
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:05,270
basically a mobile know I gotta say just

201
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,910
like rampage it looks really good

202
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,180
doesn't look as good as a rampage though

203
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,060
but still looks really good to love

204
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,790
garlic even though I've never beaten

205
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,780
this emulated or otherwise school door

206
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,510
today is gonna be the day now this is

207
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,860
probably what I'm most excited about on

208
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,060
the circuit I love ravage you love

209
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,540
gauntlet

210
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,310
jost though is like a personal favorite

211
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,230
of mine so I'm really curious as to see

212
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,420
if they got joust right it's kind of

213
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,130
hard to mess up joust and as long as

214
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,570
this is a two-player version of the game

215
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm going to be in heaven oh man I wish

216
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,460
my phone could capture this but look at

217
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,340
the colors look at the colors on the oh

218
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,530
my goodness

219
00:07:47,530 --> 00:08:01,160
yep this game looks gorgeous this is

220
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,540
such a weird game because yes I am

221
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,240
flying ostriches around trying to cows

222
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,460
to other ostriches off of their

223
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,780
ostriches and what I do they turn into

224
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,330
eggs which will then hatch into larger

225
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,400
dudes which then get picked up by

226
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,230
ostriches and don't forget there's a

227
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,880
pterodactyl I don't I don't understand

228
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,800
who invented this game or even why or

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,700
what they were thinking

230
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,080
I do love playing it the deluxe screen

231
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,669
or maybe it's the games that I'm playing

232
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,410
on this screen but this looks so good

233
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,020
compared to my deluxe version I am

234
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,620
really surprised now my this is my first

235
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,910
time playing with a joystick because the

236
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,870
other since I don't have that has the

237
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,550
trackball and the spinners and just the

238
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,229
buttons the buttons are about the same

239
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,580
so if you like the buttons on the other

240
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,209
machines you like the buttons here

241
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,790
this joystick on the left seems a little

242
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,670
corny it's definitely very clicky which

243
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,980
I guess is probably what people want an

244
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,939
arcade machine your mileage may vary but

245
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,470
it's rarely accurate so far I haven't

246
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,119
had any problems yet so this is

247
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,679
definitely a better quality than the

248
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,040
spinner but that's not saying much final

249
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,800
classic game is defender and I mean

250
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,240
honestly it's pretty hard to mess up

251
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,589
defender never one of my favorite games

252
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,720
never really didn't understand it when I

253
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,819
was a kid I played they like the Atari

254
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,319
version and it made very little sense as

255
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:18,269
well so let's see if this version makes

256
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,449
any more sense I'm sure it has to do

257
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:23,699
better right it has to be better than

258
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,470
what I remember don't okay there's a

259
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,869
thrust button there's left and right is

260
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,119
that it no just up and down oh and then

261
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,160
there's a reverse button why don't we

262
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,319
set up for the game isn't there a fire

263
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:37,079
button can i fire there's there's got to

264
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,959
be a fire button well what does that

265
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,459
button do what is that

266
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,809
what is what okay so left stick moves

267
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,300
thrust reverse then this second set of

268
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,299
buttons over here smart bomb and warp

269
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,600
and yes ladies and gentlemen this button

270
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,339
all the way over here is fire why did

271
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,850
they put defender on this set what why

272
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,269
if you have to do if you have to do this

273
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,639
to make it playable on the cabinet why

274
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,929
even put it in the cabinet put a

275
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:12,299
different game in here but crazy climber

276
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,490
in here or something that would take

277
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,019
advantage of all these joysticks or

278
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:22,139
kung-fu white what what I'm gonna try I

279
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,730
might be able to figure that out how

280
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:38,019
these buttons are so spread apart how

281
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,389
hi be able to do this let's try okay so

282
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,459
the reverse is over here and then warp

283
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:52,100
is here there's my bomb okay why fire

284
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,160
the same time unless you use one hand to

285
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,079
hit the controller and these buds to

286
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,369
sleep and which I might be able to get

287
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,499
good again

288
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:04,399
this is crap this is why why is it like

289
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:04,929
this

290
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,459
this is miserable you can't play like

291
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,319
this I want to try to find a youtube

292
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,359
video of someone who is able to play

293
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:16,129
this game like mmm it would have been

294
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:17,569
better if you left this off the machine

295
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,220
and put nothing in its place arcade why

296
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,119
not why okay rampage excellent gauntlet

297
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,589
very good even though it's the only the

298
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,109
two-player version just amazing is

299
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:32,600
always defender no no all right

300
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,489
so it's this second cabinet that I got

301
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,169
from arcade one up better than the first

302
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,029
cabinet yes by quite a bit the

303
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,829
controller is very very good the buttons

304
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,959
are very very good is that fight stick

305
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,790
quality is an arcade quality probably

306
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,429
not but it's fairly close I think it's

307
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,689
definitely going to be durable and it's

308
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,160
gonna last quite a while and I think

309
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,589
it's good enough to play those three

310
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,019
classic games as for the fourth classic

311
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,989
game the defender its offensively bad it

312
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:58,819
simply should not have been put on that

313
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,829
system if they didn't have the button

314
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,209
setup to do it I don't know why they

315
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,489
even tried well besides defender that

316
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,259
two-player version of gauntlet is very

317
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,360
very good the version of jouster just

318
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,059
two players is also very very good and

319
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,980
the three player version of rampage even

320
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,089
though I think with that setup you'll

321
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:15,410
never be able to play it three players

322
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,269
unless you have some very small friends

323
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,059
is very very good as well yeah but I

324
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,410
have very large friends so I'm gonna be

325
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,289
playing two player never three unless I

326
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,419
finally get say me to learn how to play

327
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,399
video games I guess once again I find

328
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,619
myself asking the question why do you

329
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,509
want an arcade 1up cabinet when there

330
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:34,009
are main cabinets out there there a

331
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,259
raspberry pi's there's emulations for

332
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,600
your laptop and even for your Android

333
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,939
phone so again I always ask myself the

334
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,739
question and I think after having one in

335
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,149
my house for a while and now getting a

336
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:46,039
second one I know the answer the answer

337
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,970
is collectors

338
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,160
if you have a nostalgic childhood memory

339
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,020
attached to one of those games in that

340
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,330
cabinet like gauntlet like joust like

341
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,800
rampage the way I do then obviously

342
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,170
you're going to want to have that as a

343
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,910
conversation starter a piece in your

344
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,100
home a way to remember that from time to

345
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,660
time and you know stand at the side of

346
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,280
it and plunk quarters into it like you

347
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,720
used to with when you were a kid except

348
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,740
you don't actually to actually put

349
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
quarters into it because you paid 300

350
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,280
bucks for it you might be better off

351
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,780
getting the full size our Kaden machine

352
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,280
if you have the room for the house but

353
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,900
if you want a multiple arcade machine

354
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,580
they can do better stuff that takes up

355
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,680
less space and uses less electricity

356
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
that arcade one up is a really good

357
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,950
choice and there's plenty of perks to

358
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,690
the system obviously it's a smaller

359
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,100
system so it fits easily into your

360
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,900
apartment or into your home though it is

361
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,640
fairly expensive for what you get and

362
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,430
it's not as nicely made as it could be a

363
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,840
lot of people have complained about the

364
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,040
controls even though I find them to be

365
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,650
just fine but it's nice to have in your

366
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,850
home it's a great conversation starter

367
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,220
it does give you that retro feeling and

368
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,690
every time I look at it I'm going to

369
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,220
think I have my own arcade machine I

370
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,990
have my own arcade machine and my

371
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,310
friends come over on the weekends they

372
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,560
enjoy playing them as well now I wish

373
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,810
there was more games per system I wish

374
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,890
that there they didn't take up as much

375
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,420
space as they did for just two or three

376
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,850
games I wish that you know a lot of

377
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,110
different things about it and I wish the

378
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,370
price is a little bit cheaper

379
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,290
I think 99% of people who watch this

380
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,030
you're not the target audience for this

381
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,160
but collectors like me with a lot of

382
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,620
space and a bit of disposable income

383
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,340
probably are and if you're one of those

384
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,690
people you might want to try out an

385
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,270
arcade 1up machine they're not bad for

386
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,430
the price but not one with a spinner not

387
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,560
the deluxe machine not the tempest

388
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,660
machine avoid the ones at the spinner

389
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,880
the spinner is bad the spinner has so

390
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,550
bad wait till they fixed that in 2019

391
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,490
all right guys as always thanks for

392
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,230
watching I love you very much and folks

393
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,760
thanks for the folks at arcade 1up for

394
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,560
