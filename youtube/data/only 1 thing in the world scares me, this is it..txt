1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,480
frenzy come on

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,500

yeah

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,610
your motorcycles are super fun

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,610
they're not like the most practical way to get around

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,330
especially when you have like a wife and a baby

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,090
the gas all over the gas tank

9
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,730
early morning ride to get the baby formula that i did not get yesterday

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,960
but I don't need a bag thank you

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,320
mission accomplished

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
now i'm going to go back to mi

13
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,840

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,159
what do you say Frankenstein she does not want it

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,530
Benson that's where we're taking you out there

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
where are we

17
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,470
ready how do you see it when you put on it

18
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:57,700
yeah

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
scared

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,170
quick family lunch and I think this is gonna go with friends into your house

21
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:37,390
shopping and don't know what I'm going to do

22
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,430
this morning will

23
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,210
then

24
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:59,210
for super scattered and has lacked any sort of cohesion and that's because I I

25
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,330
knew what I was doing today anyway at least what part of my day was not a zero

26
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:09,200
intention of locking it but i came here and i have been incredibly encouraged to

27
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,370
film something so I'm not bringing you here with me to be a part of what I've

28
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,990
been up to today

29
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,730
and why do you want me to film you in hitman

30
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,630
because this is you know this is real this is who I am at this moment and

31
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,890
there's my urine

32
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,010
isn't that exciting yeah I mean I like blue it's out

33
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,000
did you tell us what a pathetic uh well I recently had surgery to remove a star

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,020
, which is cancer from my leg and now i am just stuck in a bed for a week

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,370
how the DJ I'm 27 years old when did you find out you had cancer

36
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,610
about three weeks ago

37
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,660
what was the first thing that went through your head

38
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,960
honestly the first thing that went through my head this might sound of it

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,220
was that I still had so many things to make and I was like dang it I can't die

40
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,430
there's so many other things i have to create and that was really like hit me

41
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,280
really hard i was like well what kind of make like a family of five months to

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,470
live that was like the first pot so I'm trying to arrived at he had done where

43
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,549
do you want to go direct me what I would love and I mean this is the exercise I

44
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,140
do all the time

45
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,090
I'm like always in a place where I'm like constantly asking myself and I

46
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,360
finally have this much more time of what I look back and wish I have done

47
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,650
differently and then I come up with an answer and then I do that immediately

48
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,670
because i don't want to be full of regret if I find out that like my fuse

49
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,920
is being shortened you had to face that reality when we make things and i'll

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,970
talk to you and you when we make things that's who we are that's a piece of us

51
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,820
that's captured forever and we're honest I think we make things

52
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,750
it's really the creativity of who we are and so bummed me out the most was that I

53
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,140
didn't make enough stuff and I kind of thought what was the last video I

54
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,080
actually spent the whole week thinking about what was the last video that i

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,680
make be and I had like I came up with this why they even wrote like the

56
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,730
outline for it

57
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,460
that was kinda went through my head is I didn't make enough things because

58
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,650
there's still so much I need to share

59
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,540
I guess the good news is the prognosis for Jake is really good

60
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,290
you can be fine right yeah be fine just have a weird leg

61
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,740
they had a top of a part of his leg he's not gonna die

62
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,060
he's gonna be good and thank you for being too honest a chair

63
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,530
I mean it like that means a lot to me and I hope you guys can appreciate how

64
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,760
meaningful this is

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,660
thanks for visiting me when I'm like a disaster my hair is not good

66
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,970
oh look at this look you look great also by the way if you don't know this guy is

67
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,010
i will link his youtube channel below

68
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,550
he has one of the best channels on all of the internet thank you

69
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,550
all right look like someone putting the camera way now bye

70
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,120
yeah

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,550
I really meant that when i said i had no intention of filming in there and I

72
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,710
think it's a testament to Jake and just how positive an incredible that is one

73
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,320
of the first things he said the music where's your camera

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,340
I do weekly Q&A is in this log and one of the questions that springs up fairly

75
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,340
often is what is your biggest fear

76
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,590
and my response is always the same my biggest fear is getting sick is this is

77
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,820
not fair

78
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,889
like its boot and like I'm about to get on a motorcycle right now and I think if

79
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,880
you crash your motorcycle and . like that's fair because motorcycles are

80
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,150
dangerous you shouldn't be on a motorcycle that is a risk you take

81
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,300
but being sick getting cancer that's not fair

82
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,669
especially in someone like Jake's case is 27 years old he's totally positive up

83
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,249
there nothing but smiles

84
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,249
he's an amazing guy

85
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:57,650
you look like a criminal as having fun and say it's late now

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,340
baby's asleep we left the baby with canvas is mom

87
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,490

89
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,370

90
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,900

107
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,930
