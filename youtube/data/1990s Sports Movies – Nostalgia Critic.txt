1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,429
hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic I

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,500
remember it so you don't have to you

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,899
know what is it about sports movies

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,760
they're rarely good and yet we always

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,400
seem to enjoy watching them why it's

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
like watching a tape recording of a

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,820
baseball game we all know what's gonna

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,740
happen in the end so why do we waste our

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,840
time watching it this question has been

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,430
plaguing me for the last five minutes

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,859
and I can't take it anymore I have to

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,289
discover the secret behind the nostalgic

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,309
sports movies in the late 80s and

14
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,440
especially the early 90s we get a huge

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,809
flood children sports movies you could

16
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,489
say the start of it all was the Bad News

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,260
Bears at least that's where the formula

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,510
started you know the formula about the

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,430
underdog team of misfits who don't look

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,020
like they have a chance and then somehow

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,670
turn into the greatest team of all time

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,010
within one season it may have started

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,750
with the bad news bears but was the

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,280
Mighty Ducks that got the attention of

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,590
our generation it was about a lawyer who

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,390
had to spend his community service time

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,070
teaching peewee hockey to a bunch of

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,140
rowdy kids and as you might have guessed

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,460
hijinks ensue

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,710
of course in a matter of no time at all

31
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,390
the team makes it to the championship

32
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,939
because they start playing with heart it

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,619
wasn't a good movie but it wasn't really

34
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,689
a bad movie it was just kind of generic

35
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,850
supports beer but for some reason we all

36
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,390
saw it

37
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,700
which meant not one but two sequels

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,680
actually came out of this with the exact

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,930
same storyline but wait a minute how can

40
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,610
the exact same team that won the

41
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,409
championship suddenly need to be trained

42
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,600
again have you guys been training in the

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,490
off season you know I knew we forgot

44
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,260
something

45
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,470
that's very hey so this film spawned

46
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,780
dozens of mightyduck ripoffs including

47
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,030
little giants little big league little

48
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,800
angels in the outfield well okay maybe

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,240
they were all little but you get the

50
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,280
point everybody loved this formula and

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,260
abused it to death and if there's

52
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,000
anything these films have taught us it's

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,890
that there's a very specific type of

54
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,600
team you need in order to beat the

55
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,880
championships for example you always

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,770
need the fat kid the kid who does

57
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,720
nothing but apparently eat food and talk

58
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,190
about how much he likes eating food

59
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,590
after that you need the geeky kid the

60
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,600
kid who always over analyzes everything

61
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,459
and has to wear glasses so that you

62
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,470
automatically know that he's the geeky

63
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,350
kid which I highly resented and then of

64
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,450
course you need the girl the only single

65
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,760
solitary female who shows that girls can

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,130
do anything that boys can except move a

67
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,380
couch or pee standing up we own that and

68
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,180
last but not least you need the

69
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,040
good-looking all-star the character

70
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,290
who's troubled confused and could be the

71
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,850
best player on the team and only

72
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,580
somebody would give him a chance you're

73
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,300
up here me but I'm just an emotionally

74
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,190
troubled rookie what could I have to

75
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,970
offer you got Angie with you right now

76
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,400
what oh yeah apparently there's angels

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,019
out there to help players win by

78
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,880
cheating at baseball games at least

79
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,290
that's what they tell us in angels in

80
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,299
the outfield a film that stars an actor

81
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,920
that you might find to be a little

82
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,030
familiar okay that's right Tommy from

83
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,799
third Rock from the Sun stars in this

84
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,750
stinker as he tries to ask his father

85
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,459
when they'll be a family again

86
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,440
I'd say when the Angels win the pennant

87
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,600
in a last desperate attempt Tommy

88
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,489
actually turns to God and asks him for

89
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:20,140
help

90
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,190
faster than you can say religious

91
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,500
blasphemy tommy's visited by angels who

92
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,270
actually helped out the team to get them

93
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,990
to the pennant

94
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,210
now what sense does that make are you

95
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,980
seriously telling me God is up into

96
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,930
heaven somewhere saying a nasty

97
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,090
earthquake kills billions sorry not

98
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,850
really my department Oh

99
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,620
thousands of children starving in Africa

100
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,130
salary I do work in mysterious ways who

101
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,690
a little boy wants me to rig a baseball

102
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,760
game so he could be reunited with this

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,420
selfish jackass father who don't hey you

104
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,980
stop that curveball you help this

105
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,930
pitching you give him a backrub you get

106
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,040
that DiPietro that looks like

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,270
Christopher like to do some pointless

108
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,580
flashy special effects my god I've never

109
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,160
seen a cause more worthy but not all

110
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
sports movies necessarily have to follow

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,180
a team like how about the Karate Kid you

112
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,800
remember the kid that actually learns

113
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,020
karate by painting fences and waxing

114
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,180
cars yeah I know this sounds a complete

115
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,489
bullshit but I believe in this method so

116
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,230
much so that I have been training for

117
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,420
weeks painting my fences and waxing my

118
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,980
cars to become the ultimate karate

119
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,650
master and now I think it's time to put

120
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,040
my newly founded teachings to the test

121
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,020
this is my opponent and now I will

122
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,550
demonstrate the brute fighting force

123
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:44,080
that I have become

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,520
okay so maybe the idea is a little

125
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,319
far-fetched but not as far-fetched as

126
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,030
some of the other underdog stories where

127
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,560
the start of the movie is literally an

128
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,139
underdog like in Air Bud yeah you

129
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,150
remember this piece of shit right the

130
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,530
movie about a dog who is actually

131
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,509
allowed to play basketball and what

132
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:06,470
universe is this oh of course

133
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,629
it doesn't say in the rule book that I

134
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,759
can't bring a dog in to play basketball

135
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,740
what was I thinking and you wanna know

136
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,659
what else I'm pretty sure that doesn't

137
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,099
say anywhere that I can't bring

138
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,229
rollerskating black bears in it either

139
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,330
or how about professionally-trained tap

140
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,909
dancing orangutan or how about a giant

141
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:25,310
urinating elephant with one testicle who

142
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,139
can sing the classical works of Andrew

143
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,539
Lloyd Webber is that in the rule book is

144
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,380
it is it it is holy shit how amazingly

145
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,139
specific another film is just dealing

146
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,240
with one player is Rookie of the Year in

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,190
this film the kid injures his arm so

148
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,960
that it can propel back and watch like a

149
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,909
cowboy so a baseball team actually

150
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,860
decides to pick him up as a pitcher

151
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,020
seriously what baseball team could be so

152
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,969
desperate that they actually get a child

153
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:53,509
to pitch from it you sure this isn't a

154
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:54,949
true story

155
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,449
another reoccurring theme you might have

156
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,400
noticed in these movies is the villain

157
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,680
somehow the other team is always made up

158
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,139
of the most evil diabolically sneaky

159
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,819
bunch of people you've ever seen in your

160
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,590
life like remember the martial arts

161
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,789
teacher from the Karate Kid

162
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,590
this guy makes general now look like a

163
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,800
princess what are you here for old man

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,889
enemy deserves no mercy we looking at

165
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,810
what karate teacher actually talks like

166
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,789
this this is a karate dojo not a

167
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,469
knitting class well I expected this

168
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,300
country man from the YMCA but not from

169
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
this establishment my favorite scene is

170
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,050
when mr. Miyagi asked the teacher to

171
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,580
leave Daniel alone before the tournament

172
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,740
you're a pushy little bastard ain't you

173
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,110
I like yes yes very clever old man the

174
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,900
ball is in your court now but after the

175
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,330
tournament is over it is I will possess

176
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,919
the golden trophy making me sit next to

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,250
the Walgreens drugstores

178
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,350
god I need a girlfriend or how about the

179
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,090
kids from Little Giants remember how

180
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,310
intimidating they were we just can't buy

181
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,770
to tell you guys how incredibly sorry we

182
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,979
are that you didn't make the team oh

183
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,650
well thank you very much you know maybe

184
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,510
I had you guys paint wrong I always

185
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,030
assumed you were harsh mean individuals

186
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,280
but now I see you're just the playful

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,630
type who don't really want to hurt

188
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,970
anybody's feelings not dad no witty

189
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,220
repartee you know there's no way I can

190
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,169
talk my way out of than that clause it's

191
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,389
foolproof but I think my favorite

192
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,220
villains have to go to the Germans from

193
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,060
Cool Runnings

194
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,800
I don't know why but I just love these

195
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
guys they're like the great school

196
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,520
bullies of bobsledding why don't you put

197
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,260
some training views on that stick you

198
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,330
want to say something Jamaica come on to

199
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,669
make up you have no business here to

200
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,770
make them yeah and your father Baz of

201
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,710
the English needs oh no seriously

202
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,180
these guys are like the Nelsons of

203
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,750
Winter Olympics and of course you can't

204
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,400
have a kid sports movies without the

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,919
always popular sports montage this is

206
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,539
where you see a team working really hard

207
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,520
in a couple of clips and then suddenly

208
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,110
they become professional players

209
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,210
news flash guys fast editing and a

210
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,830
horrible 80s song doesn't make you

211
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,020
supports legends but to be honest not

212
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,520
all children's sports movies are

213
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
god-awful

214
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,370
I mean runnings isn't all that bad and

215
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,110
the Sandlot in my opinion is an

216
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,300
all-american classic but these films are

217
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,070
few and far between as most of these

218
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,080
movies just succumb to the same idiotic

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,910
cliches that make us all wanna get hit

220
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,639
in the head with a curveball so why do

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,740
we watch them so much because we love

222
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,479
sports and we always love the underdog

223
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,490
so much so that these films actually

224
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,919
continue to follow us now instead of

225
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,419
making cheesy sports films for kids

226
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,159
they're making cheesy sports films for

227
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,380
adults and again the good ones are few

228
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,390
and far between but I guess it's

229
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,680
important to remember that it's not how

230
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,659
good or bad the movie is it's how you

231
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,729
play the game and of course no

232
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,409
children's sports movie will be complete

233
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,050
without the latest cliche of all and so

234
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,150
- this cliche I say

235
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,129

[Music]
