00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,090
for Henry Cavill that continues to

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,250
remain unchanged additionally we have

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,960
made no current decisions regarding any

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,869
upcoming Superman films what does that

33
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,030
mean does that mean this is true are you

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,200
trying to misdirect

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,479
don't you fucking play with me what is

36
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,180
this word has been out that Warner

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,890
Brothers has been mulling a completely

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,270
different direction with its Superman

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,119
Canon for some time don't you don't you

40
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,310
don't mess with Superman can and I'm so

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,560
tired of you even considering casting

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,900
Michael B Jordan and the roller Michael

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,850
Bay chart

44
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,920
what are you doing you have Henry Cavill

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,680
why are you doing this that doesn't make

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
anything sense but at the present moment

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
a Supergirl movie is the studio's

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,190
priority a Supergirl you have the

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,520
Supergirl TV show deadline exclusively

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,370
brought back in August or in u.s. Elle

51
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,810
is working on a soup

52
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,569
Supergirl strip according to DC

53
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,370
mythology the character is a teen when

54
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,260
she escaped the doomed planet yes with

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,970
the infant who grew up is Clark Kent

56
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,000
so at this time he can't be that age is

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,430
wrong I read that somewhere else damn it

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,000
it says here that the Cavill they Warner

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,670
Brothers was trying to get Henry Cavill

60
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,700
into Shazam so I don't know where to put

61
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,760
the blame because I they tried but what

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,769
happened so that would have that would

63
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,230
have ensured that we saw more more Henry

64
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,060
as Superman if they would have got a

65
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,069
cameo in there it's what I begged for

66
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,470
it's what I was hoping that would be in

67
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,170
the Shazam film and now that's not there

68
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,260
why due to scheduling conflicts with

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,959
Henry Cavill talks broke down whether it

70
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,790
was about money or whether it was about

71
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,790
conflicts with Mission Impossible

72
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,030
fallout man Mission Impossible fallout

73
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,299
was an awesome film but as a Superman

74
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,750
fan it really fucked my character man

75
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,200
the whole Superman mustache thing look

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,320
at this shit look at what you did

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,709
this is fucking awful why did you even

78
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,109
keep that in the final cut of the film I

79
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,140
still don't understand it's fucking

80
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,570
bullshit what they've done with Superman

81
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,510
and I'm just letting out all my anger

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,790
they started off so well with Man of

83
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,859
Steel yeah say what you want about Man

84
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,070
of Steel but it is a fantastic

85
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,310
Elseworlds film it gives us new aspects

86
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,260
of the mythology that whole Krypton part

87
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,870
is so fucking awesome it's so sci-fi and

88
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,750
that's what Superman is I just hated all

89
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,060
the Jesus imagery in that film that's

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,770
when you just started losing it we're

91
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,530
where Superman is separated from those

92
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,090
above him and he's flying above them

93
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,389
look

94
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,919
down like he's a god figure that's not

95
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,860
the point of Superman the point of

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,719
Superman is he's one of us

97
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,300
he's aspiring to be the best that we can

98
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,270
possibly be and try to help and save

99
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,370
everyone even if you can't save everyone

100
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,460
the point is to try and and and to be

101
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,680
something better than yourself that was

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,009
the whole idea hope okay not Jesus

103
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,050
imagery so the thing is there are good

104
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,419
and bad aspects to that film and Zack

105
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,819
Snyder didn't understand it so so maybe

106
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,770
that this is a good thing that they're

107
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,870
gonna hit the reset button but I'm so

108
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,460
mixed right now you could tell that I'm

109
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,009
really mix because doesn't make sense if

110
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,650
if they kick out Henry Cavill who I

111
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,590
thought was great and they move forward

112
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,020
with gal gadot and Jason Momoa that's

113
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,029
just with that doesn't make any fucking

114
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,759
sense so those two are gonna get to go

115
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,650
forward and and and Henry's just kicked

116
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,419
out and Ben is kicked out as well like

117
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:26,189
if you're gonna hit the reset button you

118
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:27,930
have to fucking hit the reset button on

119
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,300
everybody get it get good doll out of

120
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,129
there get Jason Momoa out of there oh

121
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,779
you don't want to do that then why are

122
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,339
you kicking out Henry Cavill this

123
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,020
doesn't make any sense I'm holding out

124
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,860
hope that their agent or whatever clears

125
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,529
this up but it looks like talks broke

126
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,189
down and and but in his contract I know

127
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,889
he had at least one appearance left

128
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,919
maybe two I have no idea what's what's

129
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,990
what the hell this is all about but I am

130
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,860
fucking pissed

131
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,110
so I'm putting out an angry rant anyway

132
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,349
okay and this is my thoughts here some

133
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,020
this is a Twitter user who got linked by

134
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,089
some of these stories not a surprise but

135
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,460
a shame Cavill was perfect for Supes

136
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,449
but he was stuck in films that

137
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,189
fundamentally failed him and both you

138
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,399
know him and the character I expect to

139
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,949
flourish elsewhere I was so happy about

140
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,539
him getting cast in The Witcher I hope

141
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,370
that doesn't contribute to this and want

142
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,699
umbrella oh yeah well you well you want

143
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,969
her brothers Payne the man is money let

144
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:33,449
him to let him help fix it it's not his

145
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,370
fucking fault that you don't know how to

146
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,490
manage damn DC properties I'm so sick

147
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,370
your incompetence and making the DC

148
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,750
Universe this dark morose unfun piece of

149
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,440
piling shit I wit you know it's so funny

150
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,840
I wish Marvel would do a hostile

151
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,330
takeover Marvel Studios to do a hostile

152
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,150
takeover of DC they would treat the

153
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,220
characters right they would know how to

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,590
actually get the fundamental core of

155
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,690
those characters right on screen so

156
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,400
Warner Brothers if you want to hit the

157
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,259
reset button hit the reset button on

158
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,970
everybody but you're not gonna do that

159
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,710
because Wonder Woman too is gonna come

160
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,940
out and then what are you gonna fire her

161
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,560
after that what if it's a huge success

162
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,419
what if Aquaman comes out as a huge

163
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,370
success I don't anticipate that I expect

164
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,780
to be a middling success and then you

165
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,030
get rid of Aquaman too seriously

166
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,509
i what do you guys think I'm torn I'm

167
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,880
torn and I'm pissed off do you think

168
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,409
that how I'm gonna look at the comments

169
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,449
do you think Henry Cavill should get

170
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,380
another chance with actual competent

171
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,479
Direction actual competent story ideas

172
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,800
that gets the Superman character right

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,870
or should sure they flush him out and

174
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,210
then just do another one I think Cavill

175
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,940
is like the ninth Superman so I get I

176
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,060
get that Superman is recast I understand

177
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,430
that but I don't feel I felt Henry did

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,870
such a good job in Man of Steel and he

179
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,610
never really got a chance to be the

180
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,800
Superman that we all wanted because they

181
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,590
went with this stupid mopey emo shit you

182
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,919
know and do you feel that that if Henry

183
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,810
goes everybody else should get a reset

184
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,240
after their movies Aquaman done Wonder

185
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,840

186
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,560

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,980

201
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,240
like

202

and I was wearing this shirt and I was

203
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,540
like eww I wish DC could separate from

204
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,820
WB man I think that's where it is

205
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,860
there's too much studio involvement all

206
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,060
right all right guys so we don't have

207
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,100
all the facts yet I but I gave you

208
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,930
pretty much everything that's out there

209
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,720
what the agent said what WB said even

210
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,399
though they never reference Henry they

211
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,540
just said we don't know what we're doing

212
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,970
with Superman films they could have

213
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,200
already decided what they're doing with

214
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,270
