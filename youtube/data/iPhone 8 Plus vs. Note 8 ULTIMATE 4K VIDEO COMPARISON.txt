[Applause]

3
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,750
this video is going to be a

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,670
comprehensive review of the video

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,219
recording capabilities of the iPhone 8

6
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,820
plus versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 as

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,469
a youtuber the video quality on my phone

8
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,879
is one of most important things to me so

9
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,260
that's the only thing I'm gonna be

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,239
looking at in this video nothing else

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,800
except for what these things are capable

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,899
of when shooting video I built this here

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,969
rig to record video on that way the

14
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,219
iPhone and the Galaxy are both recording

15
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,989
the same image at the same time the

16
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,850
lenses are as close together as possible

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,710
enabling me to cut from one to the other

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,660
so for the rest of the video starting

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,940
right now every shot will be captured on

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,520
one of these two phones enabling me to

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,710
compare and contrast the image from one

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,189
to the other

23
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,020
Samsung therefore this is less of review

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,119
and more of a side-by-side comparison I

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,220
will not be issuing an opinion here I

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,380
just want to show you what both of these

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,140
phones are capable of okay and now a

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,060
very brief studio tour using the

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,580
respective cameras

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,990
[Music]

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,910
so this is my camera collection back

32
00:01:40,910 --> 00:02:13,730
here on the note here's a good

33
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,380
opportunity to see the skin color

34
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,500
differences on the iPhone versus the

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,870
note 8 the iPhone here appears to be

36
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,910
like a little bit more neutral and a

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,340
little bit more dim than the note 8

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,370
which offers a kind of feels a little

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,390
bright here

40
00:02:30,390 --> 00:03:21,939
[Music]

41
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,799
bin buffer on either of these this

42
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,810
outdoor skate for test is a very good

43
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,760
test of the optical image stabilization

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,790
which both of these phones have which

45
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,650
should yield a buttery smooth image when

46
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,160
you have little movements like honesty

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:04:00,640
[Music]

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:10,810
[Music]

49
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:41,690
[Music]

50
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:58,590
[Music]

51
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,210
these phones both these cameras have

52
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,700
manual features to wrack exposure rack

53
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,070
focus I'm not doing any of that for this

54
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,740
test I'm just clicking the record button

55
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,780
and then leaving them alone so this is

56
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:22,710
really a stripped-down raw video test

57
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,000
Lady Liberty that is the Statue of

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,510
Liberty

59
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,940
right there I'm now going to test

60
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,860
looking at livery

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:06:01,220
[Music]

62
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,040
[Music]

63
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,900
Samson tends to be slightly more cool

64
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:20,240
and iPhone this is the purple flower

65
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,530
test meant to show off

66
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,610
also this is a great way to check out

67
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,770
the dynamic range these flowers are

68
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,500
really bright these are in shade these

69
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,030
shouldn't be blown out they shouldn't

70
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,830
look white they should still be purple

71
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,870
these shouldn't be black it shouldn't be

72
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,950
dark they should still be purple this

73
00:06:42,950 --> 00:07:05,960
will be the slow

74
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,880
all right that just about concludes my

75
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,340
test one detail that I didn't capture in

76
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,280
that camera test is the iPhone has 256

77
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,870
gigs of internal storage which is

78
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,580
definitely a lot it's enough

79
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,380
the Samsung though has removable storage

80
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,650
so have a micro SD card laying around

81
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,510
but that means it uses the same SD card

82
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,070
is like a GoPro or a lot of other

83
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,740
cameras I prefer that but again this is

84
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,620
unbiased sort of sampling I just want to

85
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,440
show that detail with you the other

86
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,820
thing I needed to say is that this

87
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,710
side-by-side technique is something I

88
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,750
stole from my friend super-sad he's a

89
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,820
much better tech reviewer than me I will

90
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,520
link him in the description below what

91
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,320
about me I'm writing here man hello

92
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,180
something Sam below he contributed to

93
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,640
this video zero

94
