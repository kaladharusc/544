1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,780
A SOCIOPATH.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,800
What does it mean and why is everyone talking about it?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,600
Logan P: &quot;Sociopath is boiled-down, someone, who is...

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,680
MMMmmm.. Just more SAVAGE.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,380
lil chuckle

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,720
Thank you for the clarification, Logan. Very cool.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,900
Very cool.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,540
A sociopath is just someone -- a more savage, everyone.

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,940
Now this topic is being widely discussed on YouTube

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,760
thanks to Shane Dawson's latest video:

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,100
&quot;The Dark Side of Jake Paul&quot;.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,920
It's got 15 million views

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,700
and it was #1 on trending for a while

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,560
Now Shane talks about sociopaths in this series

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,920
and tries to answer the question:

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
Is Jake Paul a sociopath?

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,940
Now, this video rubbed me the wrong way

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,500
and a lot of other people

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,600
and here is why:

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,300
To be clear, when Shane announced that he was gonna

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,400
make a video series on Jake Paul,

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,600
I thought: &quot;Wow! That's actually really interesting,

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,700
because Shane usually digs deeper with his topics

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,460
and he actually Interviews people, so to uncover more information.

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,540
Like the TanaCon thing.

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,800
He actually interviewed Tana.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,400
So yeah, I was really excited about it, until he said it was gonna be an

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,520
Eight Part Series(â„¢)

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,020
Eight.

30
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,760
Parts.

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,280
WHY!?

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,440
(chuckles)

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,780
How can you make an 8 part series on Jake Paul?

34
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,280
Aaand

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,160
watching the latest video you realize

36
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,960
it's because it's not about Jake Paul (o_0?)

37
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,020
This video, called &quot;The Dark Side of Jake Paul&quot;

38
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,840
has hardly anything to do with Jake Paul.

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,380
It's a 45-minute sit-down with this therapist

40
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,860
talking about sociopaths and sort of alluding to

41
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,040
Jake being one.

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,400
Which is kind of a sociopathic thing to do,

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,540
if you ask me.

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,360
I don't know.

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,060
Trying to reach that someone that someone might be a sociopath

46
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,680
without having to have met them -

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,360
I don't know.

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,760
It's kind of weird. (a bit, yeah)

49
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,800
Now watching through this video, you realize

50
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Jake is 100% a sociopath

51
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,060
Shane is a sociopath.

52
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm a sociopath.

53
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,060
You're a sociopath.

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,460
Everyone is a sociopath.

55
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,380
Because the definition of what a sociopath is

56
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,840
was so incredibly vague that it fits anyone.

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,820
For example,

58
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,860
they drive fast probably

59
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,840
(crying manbabys stole their dad's car for the first time)

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
They drive fast. Have you ever driven fast?

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,700
Sociopath.

62
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,580
*nother lil chuckle*

63
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,220
Shane: Things that harm them, cause they don't care

64
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,240
Shane D: &quot;Tattoos.&quot;

65
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,420
Therapist: &quot;Probably.&quot;

66
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,400
*oh shit, she right*

67
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,740
sO aNyWaYs gUyS

68
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,060
*laughs*

69
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,120
I know these are just examples, but there were so many of them.

70
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,020
uhhhhh

71
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,460
My favorite is this one.

72
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,700
Shane D: &quot;I mean, this picture.&quot;

73
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,420
&quot;That looks like two fuckin straight-up sociopaths

74
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,160
planning their next move.&quot;

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,660
*gasps*

76
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,860
&quot;Oh, the caption.&quot;

77
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,440
Let's go?

78
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,680
(THOR IS ANGRY)

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
*gasps*

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,620
The caption!

81
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,440
(chuckles)

82
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,640
Is he joking? I don't understand.

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
It was before their boxing fight like:

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,160
&quot;He put a caption - 'Let's go?'

85
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,720
He's a sociopath.&quot;

86
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
He also had another one that was really good.

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,540
Therapist: &quot;For instance:

88
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,720
The other day, I was in my car and I'm driving this little

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,660
lady that started to get into the crosswalk and I was like:

90
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,540
&quot;Honey, you got like 12 seconds. I'm worried.&quot;

91
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm worried

92
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,000
&quot;(hehe) I thought people wait for you and like,  pay attention.&quot; Shane: &quot;Right.&quot;

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,920
Therapist: &quot;Y'know, sociopath would just be like:

94
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,640
&quot;UGH!&quot;

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,620
&quot;It wouldn't worry, there's no worry for her

96
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,640
&quot;You ever scoffed at an old lady being slow?

97
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,180
Ah got bad news for ya.

98
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,920
Then they dropped a big number: the big whole, the whole thing with the video

99
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,400
I think that a lot of people latched on to

100
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,200
and for a video with this many views

101
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,760
It's kind of annoying, how this is what's gonna be spread around from now on,

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,980
probably from a lot of people.

103
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,760
Shane: &quot;How realistic is it for me to know one?&quot;

104
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,780
Therapist: &quot;They say 1 in 25.&quot;

105
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,120
?

106
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,560
(nervous chuckle)

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,180
So Shane asked, how many people are sociopaths and--and she says: &quot;1 in 25&quot;.

108
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,240
Now the source I could find for this

109
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,920
was from author Martha Stout, who says that:

110
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,260
&quot;1 in 25 Americans secretly has no conscience

111
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,440
and can do anything at all without feeling guilty,

112
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,180
called &quot;The Sociopath Next Door&quot;.

113
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,800
Now this is clearly put on the front of a book

114
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
to sell more books.

115
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,340
It's a-- it's on the cover to intrigue people to sell more,

116
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,660
because it sounds interesting.

117
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,560
Now, what I found was that

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,940
3%of males and 1% of females

119
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,660
have APD - &quot;Antisocial Personality Disorder

120
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,960
and this is mentioned in the video.

121
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,640
But just because you have an APD,

122
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,280
does not make you a sociopath.

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,300
I understand what Shane is trying to do

124
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,820
is to draw more people in and make this more interesting.

125
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,760
Painting this picture that anyone can be a sociopath

126
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,300
and anyone can be used. You know, you never know

127
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,680
which makes it more interesting.

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,760
I get it, but when you're talking about mental health,

129
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,660
we kind of have to be more responsible than that

130
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,880
the video constantly uses this bizarre stock footage edits in them

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,810
with this creepy background music...

132
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,200
Shane: &quot;Oh, there's a bar right there.&quot;

133
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,820
Cameraman: &quot;Yeah.&quot;
Shane: &quot;Like if we walk into that bar,

134
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,980
there's probably, what, a hundred people?&quot;

135
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,460
So that means there's four

136
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,560
HOLY-

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
JESUS!

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,820
Is that a fake reaction enough for ya?

139
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,880
Yea-heh-heh

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
They didn't talk about Logan Paul's famous forest video.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,120
Shane: &quot;To me, it was like 'Oh! This is sad,

142
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,920
I'll put a sad song.&quot;

143
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,420
&quot;So

144
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,560
not saying he's a sociopath,

145
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,180
but

146
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,720
like

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
that's something that a sociopath would do, right?&quot;

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Therapist: &quot;Totally, yeah.&quot;

149
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Shane: &quot;If somebody didn't know like how to be emotionally,

150
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,320
they would just go to audio library and like

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
literally creepy emotion&quot;

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,340
Therapist: &quot;Just click the emotion that they want people to feel.&quot;

153
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,540
Shane: &quot;Wait, do they not know?

154
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,880
Like would they...

155
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay, if a YouTuber is a sociopath,

156
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
and they're making an apology video -

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,449
Jake Paul: &quot;...and I first want to apologize to my brother...&quot;

158
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,820
Shane: &quot;So they just type in sad? And they pick one?&quot;

159
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,580
Pewds: So like, they like just Google emotions?

160
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,360
And like, put them in the video?

161
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Uhhhh...

162
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,100
*laughs*

163
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,580
You do the same thing!

164
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,000
Everyone does this.

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,220
If you need a sad song you search for sad music.

166
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,300
So you can find the sad song

167
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,360
just like in the sad part of your video,

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
you added sad music.

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,060
Shane: &quot;Or, multiple.&quot;

170
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,900
&quot;So then it's like that person is never going to experience like the joy of like having sex for the first time

171
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,820
or like getting your first car or like going to musi-

172
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,300
&quot;They don't like.&quot;

173
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,560
And I don't know maybe it's just me, but I think adding

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,460
creepy music while talking with the therapist

175
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,720
about mental health.

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,700
It's kind of a sociopathic thing.

177
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,380
As well.

178
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,900
Now Shane's response to this was

179
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,480
the reason I made it scary and creepy

180
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,380
was so people would watch it.

181
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,480
Because if I made it like a standard video,

182
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,840
where I just sat there and was like:

183
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,060
&quot;Oh, interesting. They don't feel.

184
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,560
Okay,

185
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,300
Next topic.&quot;

186
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,820
People wouldn't care.&quot;

187
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,320
And-

188
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,420
I disagree.

189
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,060
I don't get 15 million views of my videos (just hire a bunch of unemployed immigrants to click and refresh your video 1 million times each)

190
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,919
I just think it's some topics you either do them right or you just don't touch them

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,880
The video is called the dark side of Jake Paul. People are gonna watch regardless

192
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,290
I'm pretty sure and you didn't even have anything to do with Jake or hardly anything

193
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:10,919
When it comes to this type of person or when it comes to this disorder, you don't want to XYZ

194
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,629
I mean, you know the video uses clips of randomly of youtubers while talking about

195
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:24,069
this whole thing, you know not just take Paul but others as well if you have to be kind of a

196
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:33,819
Super honestly, are you sociopath?

197
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,599
Exactly

198
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,949
And not until 11 minutes and 30 seconds in the video you get this disclaimer

199
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:49,930
Old clips shown are youtubers actors and even myself are just being used for context. I'm hundred percent. Not even seeing any people sure know

200
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,759
Usually you addicts at the beginning of the video, but I don't know

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,189
That's just what I think I'm like, I don't know. It just made me laugh out loud

202
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,060
Like I have to drag in all these youtubers by the way guys

203
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,639
Not even you waiting anything

204
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:12,310
My favorite one. However, it's one they're mimicking you're honing their craft kind of so if they're not very good at it

205
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,189
They won't elicit the right response out of you

206
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:19,469
Her fans are not having it because they once again just a clip for context

207
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:25,120
It has nothing to do with why we're saying we're not attacking this person just for context

208
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,469
Just for context just for context clips as well was used with actual killers actual murderers

209
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,659
Like OJ Simpson and I don't know who this is, but will you kill again?

210
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,870
If the opportunity arises I hope so

211
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,540
so it's kind of blurring the line between not just youtubers but also sociopaths and

212
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,649
killers as well just because you're a sociopath that doesn't mean

213
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:57,310
you're a killer or that you want to hurt people and this was sort of sort of reinforced by the

214
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,589
Therapists as well in the video talking about impulsive 'ti and that that can lead you to become more dangerous

215
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,340
Which is what makes them a little dangerous. I always thinking

216
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,920
Like a dangerous thing for both of them and the people around them, you know

217
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:17,230
When a simple google will tell you the opposite while it's coming to think sociopaths and Psychopaths are inherently dangerous. This is more

218
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,960
Constructive TV drama than a true reflection of the disorder. It is definitely possible

219
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,330
But it's not an inherent characteristic

220
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,290
And Shane is doing the same thing here it sort of overly dramatic

221
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,490
Sizing the topic for the sake of drawing people in so your only regret is that the torture didn't go on, right?

222
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,960
And I regret not killing my other victim the weirdest thing about the video

223
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:49,810
Is that the therapist they're referring to really icky or really nasty or gross behavior?

224
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:56,020
It's just creepy

225
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,630
Isn't that kind of weird for a therapist to do I don't know I understand not liking it

226
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,030
I don't either but for a therapist to describe

227
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:11,020
Mental disorder as really icky really gross. I don't know. That's kind of weird to me now the cherry on the top

228
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:18,940
After this video, you know has described everyone as a sociopath basically anyone falls under this category

229
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,390
It's also sponsored by better health today's episode is brought to you by better handled

230
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,930
This is something I really think it's great something. I actually really believe it

231
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,340
You're a sociopath by the way this video sponsored by online therapy

232
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,620
Also this video enter the coupon code Shane for your online therapy today by the way guys

233
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,080

234
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,150
Now this is one of those online therapy apps. They've been coming more and more popular

235
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,190
A lot of people are said they work great for them

236
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,660
But they also get a lot of bad reviews saying that they don't work at all

237
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,280
And if they work for you great, but it's kind of questionable to promote one of these services

238
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,000
I did I think a year ago and they asked me to talk about their and I'm like, okay fine

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,750
But I would never want to take money from it. I would never want to take money for a mental health app

240
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,050
It just doesn't feel right and I'm probably the most morally skewed person ever

241
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,770
So for me to come up with a conclusion and not Shane, it's kind of weird

242
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:27,950
Now after all this there was a bit of backlash. I mean it has a million likes and 30,000 dislike us

243
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,380
That's hardly anything. I think most people just enjoy the video and I think that's fine

244
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,520
But Shane did make an apology where he said I'm sorry if I offended anybody. Oh

245
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,950
No, no

246
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,959
No, no Shane, this is not it okay. I'm sorry if I offended anyone said in lengthy snapchat video

247
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,750
Okay, Shane, if you need help with apology videos just reach out. I'm really good at them

248
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:03,279
This is a big no-no for one. I'm sorry if I offended anybody if you are offended for someone, I'm sorry you were offended

249
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,209
I know he doesn't mean it like that. It's just bad badly worded

250
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,290
The therapist made a response as well. Hey everybody

251
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,450
I found myself getting bullied in comments

252
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,740
and I know I've opened myself to a whole nother group of people and that's fine and I'm an adult and

253
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,230
Like if I have to block you

254
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,510
That's what I'm gonna do because I don't have to allow you to hang out in my pool great response

255
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,820
These are great responses guys

256
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,900
Just please just come to me. All right, if you need help with apologies

257
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,839
Well, I'll set you up they say in it. They say me you're making it worse five hours of footage

258
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,790
I feel really cut it down

259
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,459
And try to make it entertaining which is my fault. I should have maybe just left a very

260
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:53,510
plain, I wanted to make it entertaining but but at the at the core of it what I wanted people to know is like an

261
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,480
Actual sociopath does not care

262
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,860
It's an okay to dehumanize someone just because they don't care if you do I don't really agree with that

263
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,510
I think Shane made a mistake of starting up this series asking if it's Jake Paul a

264
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:15,250
Sociopath it's either yes or no and and, you know, maybe to the benefit of the doubt maybe he uncovers some that

265
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,250
We don't know about Jake that hasn't been told before there's a lot more episodes coming up to this series

266
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,640
So to remain optimistic that could be the case. I

267
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,390
Don't know if Jake is a sociopath because I'm not a psychologist and I can't evaluate him

268
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,420
But a lot of these topics are gray areas

269
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:43,940
while we like to say that someone either yes or no is a sociopath most of the time that that's not the case and

270
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:52,220
Funny enough Logan reached out and made a video talking about just this starting off with a classic less eye

271
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,670
beer Shane Dawson

272
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,120
How to start a heavy topic you gotta say it out

273
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,660
99% of the time someone is not a sociopath or not a sociopath. My opinion is there's a sociopathic

274
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,070
Spectrum at which point some people lie higher on it than others

275
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,820
And by the way, some of the biggest businessmen in the world could be considered

276
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,070
sociopathic mark Jobs

277
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,839
Steve Zuckerberg a little bit actually makes a lot of sense here. How about that?

278
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,900
I never thought I'd say that then again, he also did say yeah original point when trying to say is Shane

279
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,390
you

280
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,970
You are scaring your young and interminable

281
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:41,779
You are scaring your young impressionable audience Logan Paul everybody, Logan Paul

282
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,279
the least self-aware human being on the planet

283
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:53,870
Shane Dawson, how dare you scare these children now Logan for that 100th time. So many people told me

284
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,240
Before they're famous for its video Oh Logan. He's like the cool one of the poles

285
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,600
He's like the the nice one the less crazy one and I always said nah. Nah that ain't it

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,120
he's a real crazy one and then the Fords the video came out and I'm like I told you I freaking told you I was

287
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,170
even quick to point out like Logan Pole is a sociopath because if you look at YouTube

288
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:21,050
It's a shame because it's such an interesting topic this whole thing is an interesting topic and now it's just gone completely

289
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,670
Gotten completely mixed up

290
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:31,900
I think the line between youtubers and sociopaths is really interesting because if you look at YouTube it sort of rewards

291
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,850
Sociopathic behavior and I think that's why it's so easy for me for example to spot it in other

292
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,680
Youtubers while for a lot of other people who are not aware of it. It will just go unnoticed

293
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,110
for example

294
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,360
You understand as a youtuber what kind of thought process?

295
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,910
Went through a person's mind or a youtubers mind when they made a thumbnail

296
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,060
what they want to present in it what was important for them for other people to know or how they present a message and a

297
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,370
Topic how they presented in what tone and like they said with the music or whatever

298
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,850
most people don't think about these things but as a youtuber you realize and you think and you understand what went through their head to

299
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,380
Make these decision and you realize wow

300
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,610
They're actually kind of messed up and YouTube in a way rewards these things you you don't get more views for having integrity

301
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:25,000
That's for sure and I think that's the thing with Jake and Logan. They they just don't care. They're just extremely

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,540
Goal-oriented and motivated to to become popular on YouTube and earn money. That's what they want

303
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,230
They're not trying to hide that it's pretty obvious. They'll do whatever they can to get that does that mean they're sociopaths?

304
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,520
I don't know maybe but it's certainly 100 percent makes some scumbags

305
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,880
Maybe they have some other personality behind the scenes. Maybe they're actually really cool in person. Maybe really chill

306
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,590
But then again we've seen their action online. Does it really matter?

307
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:59,110
You wouldn't go to a killer and be like well, maybe he's actually like a really nice person

308
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,190
That's a bad example I but you understand what I mean

309
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,960
I think what went wrong with this whole video the whole shame video and why I think it's so bad is because

310
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,950
Apparently Shane didn't tell Katie. I think that's her name therapist that this was about Jake Paul

311
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,890
Well, I'll explain later what this all is

312
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,500
There's a lot more to it yikes

313
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,010
Apparently Shane, I think he mentioned in the video that he didn't tell her that originally that this was gonna be about Jake Paul

314
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,910
they were just gonna sit down and talk about sociopaths and

315
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,450
You know, she's referring a lot of times in this video

316
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,580
about anti personality disorder

317
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,920
But through editing and the creepy music

318
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:48,630
and all that it kind of conflicts and it becomes anything and become it gets mixed up with killers and all kinds of stuff and

319
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,250
I don't know if that's necessarily her fault as well. And I understand Shane wants to make things creepy. That's what he does

320
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,230
He makes these conspiracy videos

321
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,000
That's how he keeps things interesting and I can understand that and I can respect that

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,110
He does a great job at that and I also think Katie took off her therapist had to sort of

323
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,010
Drop these numbers and the facts just to make it more interesting because she knows that's what Shane won and kind of like I don't

324
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,790
Neil deGrasse Tyson, it drops these science bombs to blow your mind

325
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,140
It's the same kind of thing and maybe it wasn't deliberate but these two things

326
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,960
Playing into each other just made it into in my opinion a really bad video, unfortunately

327
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,880
some topics

328
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,440
You just have to be more careful when you cover them and maybe not add in creepy music and all these

329
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,690
Stupid things in the background. I think they realized that now that's it

330
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,180
However for my eight part series about Shane Dawson. Hope you guys are look forward to this

331
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,310
Actually, I might make it a twenty part series

332
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:56,940
I think we can really uncover some deeper darker secrets in here smash like if you enjoyed Let me know what you guys think. Are you just jealous because Shane gets more views than you? Yeah.

333
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,000
(its ya girl macy I just did all the captains when I should've been doing my trigonometry homework I need to figure out this triangle)
