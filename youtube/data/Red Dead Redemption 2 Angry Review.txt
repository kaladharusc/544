24
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:06,209
Red Dead Redemption - it's got a lot to

25
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,909
live up to in my mind the first game

26
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,760
earned one of my first 10 out of 10

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,620
legendary ratings will this motion over

28

[Applause]

31
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,980
it's taken me forever to get this review

32
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,400
up because frankly I wanted to 100% the

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,139
whole thing and then maybe even wait for

34
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,599
the multiplayer component to come out

35
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,120
before giving my complete opinion on it

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
but you know I've waited long enough I'm

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,650
falling too far behind and I can make a

38
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,449
separate video for that component once

39
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,540
it releases I also wanted to do a few

40
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,269
new parodies with some real horses but

41
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,280
that didn't really work out at this

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,949
ranch so it's important I get up my

43
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,180
opinion of one of my favorite franchises

44
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,829
regardless of whether or not I nail the

45
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:02,570
parodies

46

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,539
sorry about that guys so how does the

51
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,199
game live up to the first well there are

52
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,169
so so many improvements

53
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,690
I'd say nearly every aspect of the game

54
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,690
has been touched and improved with a few

55
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,030
exceptions and I'll get to those but I

56
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,220
mean if I had to make a pro column for

57
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,460
this game it would like simply say

58
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,009
everything there's just too many good

59
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,560
things to list here without this video

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,900
being like an hour and a half long so

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,550
I'll point out some of the important

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,090
ones

63
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,210
what will strike you right away is how

64
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,720
impressive the graphics an attention to

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,620
detail is especially for console man

66
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,020
look at these graphics and this is Joe

67
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,229
this is fuckin ps4 this looks as good as

68
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,250
a PC game and I'm playing on a canoe

69
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,190
sold hardware I would love to see this

70
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:29,990
game on PC man drag his ass it is

71
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,610
absolutely gorgeous the lighting effect

72
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,430
[Music]

73
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,460
that look good detail with the horse

74
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,050
muscles look at his nose that look good

75
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,120
the realistic snow and mother you can

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,479
walk around in a hacky started I'll god

77
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:04,380
damn it huh oh my god and of course the

78
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,440
horse balls you gotta admire these

79
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,590
holders ball physics these balls will

80
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,599
actually move left and right and suede

81
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,490
you can zoom on right

82
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,410
right on in the pause that look good we

83
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,200
just zoom in here oh there you go that's

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,300
there's your physics he knew he was

85
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,010
looking at me cell yeah you want

86
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,100
something to look at but okay graphics

87
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,780
are fine but how about the new main

88
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,570
character Arthur Morgan we obviously

89
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,490
spend the most time with him well he's

90
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,340
thankfully got an interesting story and

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,580
journey I'd even say that maybe for me

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,220
Arthur was a better protagonist than

93
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,560
John it's kind of hard on the memory and

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,030
it just seems to be so much to his

95
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,890
character it may be a bit unfair

96
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,380
actually as the game is longer and

97
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,600
there's way more dialogue here in this

98
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,790
game but I just wanted to say I really

99
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,700
enjoy playing as Arthur he's right up

100
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:19,930
there

[Music]

103
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,039
and the game really plays to its

104
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,899
strengths that they they've marketed

105
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,629
this gang mechanic as you go on missions

106
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,579
with various members of your said gang

107
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,769
it will often pair you off and and

108
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,409
really let you get to know these new and

109
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,809
old characters allowing you to form a

110
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:55,149
bond with them and actually care about

111
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,699
some of them especially when the game

112
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:59,949
starts to ramp things up and these

113
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,439
people are put in actual danger

114
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:44,290
shit happens throughout six chapters and

115
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,389
too long epilogues I thought the story

116
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,970
of Red Dead Redemption too did enough to

117
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,250
entertain me all the way through and

118
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,319
well it may have lacked a bit of that

119
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:56,050
dramatic finish like the original Red

120
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,910
Dead and it kind of felt like its

121
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,100
journey to some cuban island was kind of

122
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,529
you know pointless just to mimic the

123
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,870
mexico missions in the original by the

124
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,500
end though i felt it was all well worth

125
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,009
the payoff though I do wish maybe maybe

126
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,319
just maybe it could've ended with a

127
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,990
slightly different ending some of it

128
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,029
kind of feels like a retread of old

129
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,899
grounds in many ways but it certainly

130
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,389
justifies its namesake Red Dead

131
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,140
Redemption

134
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:14,230
and while it might not have the

135
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,120
impactful story beats of the original

136
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,370
what it does have throughout and holds

137
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,500
up in this version is the excellent

138
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,410
dialogue not only is it extremely well

139
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,839
written and appropriate for the time but

140
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,420
there are so many spoken lines here it

141
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,800
boggles the mind hats off to you held

142
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,259
during horse rides actually believe

143
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,329
they've recorded all their lines two

144
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,819
ways like in Spider Man for when your

145
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,680
partner's further down the road from you

146
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,459
I kind of tested it not quite good work

147
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,069
back there Arthur everything went okay

148
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:52,139
few loose ends nothing major and John

149
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,110
about what you'd expect he's taking it

150
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:04,390
hard

153
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,350
going to get that board back whatever it

154
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,839
takes and just as in the original Red

155
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,050
Dead the fantastic various side missions

156
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,209
don't even feel like side missions at

157
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,639
all they feel like mainline story

158
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,189
missions with how interesting and varied

159
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:35,500
they are always gonna be kicked in the

160
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,360
face yeah now you get a Robin and the

161
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,360
game here the world fields alive with so

162
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,970
many side activities good ones too you

163
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,550
can lose yourself for hours in poker

164
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,430
cleaning out your opponents again just

165
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,720
like last time I beat you both parents

166
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,269
exes I win you dumbass

167
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,280
pair of sixes doesn't be a full house

168
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:08,410
I said para fixes or new Domino's I love

169
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,420
playing dominoes with my grandpa it's

170
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,080
here there's that five finger fillet

171
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,940
returning there's hunting with detailed

172
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,120
animal skinning or fishing it's got that

173
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,270
old country feel no here you can buy him

174
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,570
in a shop won't be quite so satisfying

175
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,630
getting in with some shop ball easy for

176
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,470
you to say but maybe I'm inclined to

177
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,640
agree and even a full-fledged theater

178
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,550
show like in Grand Theft Auto with slide

179
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,700
animations magicians and even can-can

180
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
girls

181
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:55,950
[Music]

182
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,170
[Applause]

183
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,340
[Music]

184
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,500
it's all really immersive and above and

185
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,300
beyond the call of duty

186
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,430
but that's Rockstar for you I spent

187
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,950
hours and hours just browsing through

188
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,920
catalogues stocking up on appropriate

189
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,560
items for longer journeys and gunfights

190
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,370
but also trying out various outfits and

191
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,860
different haircuts not only for the

192
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,590
best-lookin Arthur but also the most

193
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,110
appropriate for the climate this shit is

194
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,030
crazy look at all this holy shit oh my

195
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,120
God look at the cut the gun

196
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,070
customization is amazing in this game

197
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,960
all I'm gonna make this just like my

198
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,560
actual freaking piece maker this is so

199
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:53,030
detailed and so cool this is a Haas the

200
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,890
next most impressive thing is the

201
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,380
animations and physics Arthur and

202
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,560
everyone and everything in this world

203
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,380
moves realistically and it feels so

204
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,190
alive despite it being maybe a tad too

205
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,590
sensitive which results in some

206
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,200
hilarious horse crashes early in the

207
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,060
game when you're trying to get used to

208
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,040
the fact that if you barely brush

209
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
against something at speed you're a fly

210
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:48,450
off alright that's not to say I didn't

211
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,580
deserve some of the Falls I took because

212
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,190
I certainly did and it is always super

213
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,950
funny

214
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:01,190
suck it you fucking fuck oh shit back

215
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:07,130
boom right foot back but don't don't

216
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,959
don't don't don't

217
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,810
but it can be a bit frustrating though

218
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,089
when the controls are so deep and

219
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,240
complex and varied that use is the same

220
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,070
button for things that will get you

221
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,620
accidentally into a fight and the law

222
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,420
wanting to kill you for a simple

223
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,240
accident no I press some Wars what the

224
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,010
fuck could stay fuckin oh shit no god

225
00:15:34,010 --> 00:16:02,870
dammit you fucking idiot the law is just

226
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,880
way too sensitive before you become

227
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:30,440
wanted peace I'm sorry officer I

228
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:58,150
[Applause]

229
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:08,400
[Music]

230
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,020
aside from that it's just a pleasure

231
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,260
being in this world I can really enjoy

232
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,660
it as you can tell especially because

233
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,810
I'm a fan of Western I'm from pixs

234
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,089
that's right and this is triple-a stuff

235
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,780
at its finest no bullshit

236
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,190
microtransactions or broken off sections

237
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,650
of the story sold as expansions or

238
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,770
stupid season passes though guys maybe

239
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,410
some of them might come later when the

240
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,630
Red Dead online but that remains to be

241
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,880
seen but credit must be given here

242
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,820
however this game right it's a

243
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,210
masterclass the world can out of 10 the

244
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,820
graphics 10 out of 10 the animation is

245
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,370
10 out of 10 the attention to detail is

246
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,040
10 out of 10 it only stumbles in very

247
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,710
small ways here and there this game

248
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,040
immerses you to an insane degree perhaps

249
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,640
a bit too much going too far picking

250
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,280
things up one at a time is realistic but

251
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,450
painstakingly slow looting enemy bodies

252
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,790
takes ages which results in your gang

253
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,670
member friends constantly yelling at you

254
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,440
while you're looting everything not

255
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,640
nailed down one of these guys are giving

256
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,610
us some good health care revolver

257
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,240
killing people actually pays off the guy

258
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,320
that fell off the water tower too

259
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,420
yeah well you could wait a little longer

260
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,510
Dutch I'm the leader this here gang now

261
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,430
look at me look at me

262
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,350
I'm the captain now enough oh fuck off

263
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,140
got plenty more looting and do plenty

264
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,350
and the game has you constantly leaving

265
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,180
your most valuable weapons and your

266
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,510
horses n natori because because that's

267
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,690
the way it was in the Old West also can

268
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,840
I just say that I hate slow walking and

269
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,680
camp I can't get the what the fuck why

270
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,480
isn't it like just go now it just

271
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,370
fucking goes there's some invisible

272
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,220
walls and some fucking slowdown is

273
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,090
pissing me off now this game is confess

274
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,300
but it's also pissing me off

275
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,890
I've always hated those types of

276
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,620
restrictions and this game has a few of

277
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,470
those I hate how this thing is slow

278
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,690
right here why look I'm what the fuck

279
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,790
why are you doing this Rockstar this

280
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,640
will stupid just give me the same key

281
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,490
movement controls in and outside this

282
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,530
damn building dammit god dammit like on

283
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,600
missions you need to do them in certain

284
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,480
ways ok can't get too creative or you'll

285
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,720
get a failed state I told you I was

286
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,500
gonna be an outlaw what failed Oh son of

287
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,000
a bitch what are you telling me I can't

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,580
do whatever I want to do your credits

289
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,720
discrete from the sheriff's even you

290
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,640
shot a guy in the back well come on now

291
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,470
that's fair because it's trying to tell

292
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,870
a story but it may surprise some who

293
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,670
think it's a little more open-ended that

294
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,800
it is it's not far crying the way you

295
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,110
can approach everything in that sense

296
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,840
but it's not even the worst one the

297
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,630
worst worst most unforgivable one is the

298
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,180
lack of fast travel it is so annoying

299
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,730
maybe 50% of this game

300
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,860
friggin half of

301
00:20:37,860 --> 00:21:28,940
game is someone talking your ear off

302
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,710
there's a cinematic camera that you can

303
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,140
use to auto ride but the game never

304
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,410
really shows you specifically how to do

305
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,330
it it just mentions that it's there

306
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,400
which is gonna piss off a lot of people

307
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,559
who who may not ever find that function

308
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,230
so you got to hold the button though all

309
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,870
putting the camera button on and then

310
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,240
releasing and you can stop ruining your

311
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,720
damn thumb if I didn't figure that out I

312
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,309
likely would have dropped the game a

313
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,040
whole point with this shit agreed that

314
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,230
stuff gets annoying and later in the

315
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,870
game you often feel discouraged from

316
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,210
doing those faraway side missions

317
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,080
knowing there's a massive long ride back

318
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,350
with no fast travel on the way back and

319
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,200
even the extremely puzzling ly

320
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,140
well-hidden fast travel option in the

321
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,540
game that it gives you it's still just a

322
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,850
one-way trip this choice

323
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,610
it was clearly made by the devs team to

324
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,340
make trains and stagecoaches actually

325
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,799
means something to use and to show off

326
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,340
the beautiful wildlife mud and snow and

327
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,429
freaking everything scenic here but what

328
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:40,770
they really should have done is just if

329
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,540
you want to restrict it fine restricted

330
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,030
for the first half of the game and then

331
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,460
for the second half when

332
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,950
but he's seen everything 40 50 hours in

333
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,620
let us fast travel back and forth to

334
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,720
caught all that horse padding for those

335
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,820
that don't want it and maybe it's to

336
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,830
show the hardships of the Old West but

337
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,650
unless the developers forget the real

338
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,580
Wild West yeah it was not really a fun

339
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,550
place most of the time to be in so yeah

340
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,140
try not to go too far rocks are boy no

341
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,860
what is that smell bad Oh smell like an

342
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,230
orc shit that's cuz I got the deluxe

343
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,070
edition ps4 comes with real-life

344
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,960
[Music]

345
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,020
controller not only can you be some Wild

346
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,480
West now you can breathe it too

347
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:48,830
Oh smell it alright the immersion and if

348
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,170
it seems I'm now listening mostly

349
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,480
negatives it's because while these are

350
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,640
they're ultimately rather small gripes

351
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,490
right but they're even more apparent

352
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,610
when everything else in this game is so

353
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,130
damn good that I don't even want to stop

354
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,170
playing it and it took me forever to do

355
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,480
this review I just want to go back to it

356
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,420
so I can understand how people will then

357
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,210
clearly to give this game a 10 out of 10

358
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,550
there are so many aspects of it that are

359
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,560
legitimately 10 out of 10

360
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,800
however from me when a sequel comes out

361
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,190
I'm often a bit more harsh on it tough

362
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,550
love

363
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,790
okay so these small things started to

364
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,730
stack up like how I oddly felt that the

365
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,490
economy of the game breaks after one

366
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,530
particular early game Bank mission did

367
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,510
you run into this stupid and dangerous

368
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:54,950
thank you I was so flushed with castin I

369
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,440
didn't need to do any actual robbing

370
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,890
after that you know how Dutchess gay

371
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,750
supposed to be doing all in Robin

372
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,090
there's nothing to really use on your

373
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,370
cash nothing to buy no houses no

374
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,040
property even not even really the many

375
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,250
weapons sure there's 59 weapons in the

376
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,580
game whoo however most of them are

377
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,520
puzzlingly locked until you reach some

378
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,770
certain story mission or if you just so

379
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,450
happened to get lucky to pay attention

380
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,100
with a problem somebody drops some and

381
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,030
they pick it up

382
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,180
why is everything else so painfully

383
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,580
realistic in the game and you're telling

384
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,700
me I can't walk into a store and buy a

385
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,670
gun that I'm staring at for sale right

386
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,950
in front of me

387
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,230
howdy partner I'd like to buy a weapon

388
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,280
well you came to the right place partner

389
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,390
you weren't here - yes but you're

390
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,770
wearing a bartender outfit don't worry

391
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,380
about it all right whatever

392
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,560
show me the the Cattleman's special oh

393
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,820
that thing's beauty check it out yeah

394
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,990
that looks real nice I'll buy know what

395
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,440
said no no what I've got the money right

396
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,360
here right okay and it's for sale right

397
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,640
yes well then take my money then know

398
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,520
what you little see they are willing to

399
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,620
make gameplay concessions locking those

400
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,680
off over realistic stuff for gameplay

401
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,110
purposes so that puts into question some

402
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,660
of the other design choices like the

403
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,720
quest log is a little weak the map is

404
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,360
undetailed the inventory system a bit of

405
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,850
a mess and the gang donations at coffer

406
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,400
system seems pointless by the end of the

407
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,800
game seeing as where you end up by its

408
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,090
conclusion and finally the combat

409
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,080
unfortunately that's a stiff

410
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,120
of rockstar games seems a little

411
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,160
untouched here it's just better to snap

412
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,650
to auto in and then snap to auto aim

413
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,020
over and over then trying to manually

414
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,120
aim most of the time and that is unless

415
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,040
you're using the thankfully still

416
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,220
awesome Deadeye system to shoot heads

417
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,680
and even guns out of people's hands just

418
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,260
shooter ride off that's it I've had

419
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:40,930
enough your shit so that's a lot of

420
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,560
Awesome some small little annoyances and

421
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,150
we have finally arrived at the final

422
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,790
verdict which honestly isn't even really

423
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,740
a final verdict since a free update is

424
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,110
gonna put the whole new second game to

425
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,630
this package for free in multiplayer and

426
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,850
I hear there's some unique stuff that

427
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,500
maybe I've been mentioned was missing

428
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,390
that's gonna be packed in there so if

429
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,580
the rating may change but I feel the

430
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,860
final verdict for Red Dead Redemption 2

431
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,200
in its current single-player release

432
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,690
state at the time of this review is a 9

433
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,860
out of 10 wouldn't an easy badass seal

434
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,140
of approval is it better in many ways

435
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,510
than the original yes it could have

436
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,210
easily been a 10 out of 10 itself but I

437
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,940
needed to justify my 9 out of 10 with

438
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,040
all of the above that I talked about I

439
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,760
absolutely love this game every single

440
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,440
one of you should buy it spend your

441
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,120
hard-earned money on this because there

442
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,940
are so few games out this like there at

443
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,220
this quality level even if you don't

444
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,800
like westerns own the game I've gotten

445
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,350
so many hours out of yes even with the

446
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,170
horse ride padding taken out it is still

447
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,470
so many hours of enjoyment and so many

448
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,960
more yet to come
