2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,450
man this kid is an asshole he rides

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,889
balloons to the moon to fish for what I

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,809
guess is cloud trout by the way you know

5
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,190
the dark part of the moon is supposed to

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,780
be silent and not a nesting crook for

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,670
delinquent kids right also as if you

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,170
needed any more proof that dreamworks

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,760
desperately wants to be pixar they rip

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,530
off the classic scene from up for the

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
opening logo wait up came out two years

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,350
after this

13
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,270
well dreamworks still totally wants to

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,040
be picked up Jesus movie are you trying

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,510
to go on Harry Potter on us I know

16
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,520
Prisoner of Azkaban was that series

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,140
third entry but this is a totally

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,610
different franchise full of magical

19
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,350
creatures and sentient animals and

20
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,780
wizards and operating and a protagonist

21
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,620
with two trusted allies and wait are you

22
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,120
even here doesn't look like anyone at

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,739
your table is excited to be here so it's

24
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,239
not like you got dragged in against your

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,089
will - so Pinocchio secretly loves

26
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,859
dinner theater and for that reason we

27
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,479
get this cheap wooden joke at least this

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,979
movie's telling me early on what passes

29
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:04,720
for humor do you my gingerbread man

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,040
would go on to transform into a

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,720
different magical creature Twitter troll

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,490
how is this vanity mirror even lit up

33
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,500
you might say candles but then I'd call

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,090
you a filthy liar because this is a

35
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,829
steady light bulb type of light oh yeah

36
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,420
I remember that storyline about the

37
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,759
fairy godmother in the last movie no me

38
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,060
either

39
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,890
I had to Wikipedia that point is at

40
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,360
least the second movie had the courtesy

41
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,890
to not depend totally on having the

42
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,090
knowledge of what happened in the first

43
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,680
one I get that this is a bed fit for a

44
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,689
king but before he turned back into a

45
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,729
frog a regular-sized King slept here

46
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:32,619
right with his regular-sized wife but it

47
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:36,119
can easily fit two grown-ass ogres oh I

48
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,630
know

49
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,490
isn't it wonderful I'm glad that the

50
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,899
Shrek franchise basically became The

51
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,780
Addams Family overtime to us is

52
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,770
wonderful to them

53
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,359
nice try a movie but no matter how cute

54
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,829
you try and make these dragon donkey

55
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:49,299
babies I'm always going to remember that

56
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,399
they're a crossbred unholy abomination

57
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,170
against God and man movie somehow misses

58
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,159
the chance to do something completely

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,469
on-brand and truthful by not calling

60
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,149
this Shrek the turd I'm not gonna play

61
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,829
this song for a number of reasons but

62
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,479
just trust me it's royal pain by the

63
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,189
eels which is a great song by an awesome

64
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,719
band so I continue to wonder how the

65
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,670
Shrek franchise can be so good at music

66
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,360
while being so terrible at movie

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,590
remember that time that Shrek either

68
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,569
killed or maimed a dude in front of a

69
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,400
large crowd with no repercussions

70
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,410
wait a minute how the sales catch fire I

71
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,880
suppose that's the joke but damn it I'm

72
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,260
gonna be thinking about those sales for

73
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,970
the rest of the movie damn movie you've

74
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,380
already ripped off Holy Grail with the

75
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,850
coconuts and Dumb and Dumber with the

76
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,020
toenail grinder in the first five

77
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,310
minutes you do know the difference

78
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,440
between homage and outright theft right

79
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,120
nope all right carry on

80
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,470
yeah but the king and queen from the

81
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,390
last movie never dressed like this if we

82
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,860
will go to all the lengths for one

83
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,140
stupid fucking sidekick oh hey get your

84
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,760
fat bastard out of my Shrek who do you

85
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,670
think we're kidding I am an ogre

86
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,080
isn't this the plot point of every Shrek

87
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,610
movie and how many times does he have to

88
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,390
remind us of this

89
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,960
what if theoretically yeah they were a

90
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,000
little ogre feet damn if this movie

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
takes a hard left into ocher porn I

92
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,510
gotta say it'd be much more on board

93
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,600
have you seen a baby lately they just

94
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,570
eaten poop and they cry when they poop

95
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,280
on their listing all the reasons babies

96
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,170
are terrible cliche aside I think this

97
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,850
was just the movies excuse to say poop a

98
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,040
million times in five seconds wait Shrek

99
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,990
has nipples clay has he always had

100
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,460
nipples and I've just never noticed it

101
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,170
and even so what are they for I haven't

102
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,950
had this many questions about

103
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,540
unnecessary nipples since Batman and

104
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,850
Robin don't forget to pay the god that

105
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,459
Lillian for explaining I am proud to

106
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,250
call you my son and I'm proud to call

107
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,970
you my frog King dad-in-law Oh Shrek

108
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,660
never change

109
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,490
you had Farquaad in the first movie and

110
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,140
you crazy comic dispensers have cracked

111
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,760
up all the sensors with this double

112
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,270
entendre

113
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,230
the Frog King movie directly inspires

114
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,940
the most irritating part of Deadpool -

115
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,010
it's a funeral so therefore it must rain

116
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,270
no matter what at this point in the

117
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,740
movie they're playing the wings version

118
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,150
of Live and Let Die and I have to ask

119
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,220
did anyone actually think this through

120
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,720
this is not a mournful song that pays

121
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,130
respect to a morose occasion like

122
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,660
hallelujah did in the first rap it's a

123
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,570
goddamn Bond theme Cinderella is in Far

124
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,230
Far Away right now eating bonbons wait

125
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,450
but Prince Charming just named off all

126
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,950
the actual plots that the villains in

127
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,090
the poem were involved with if

128
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,530
Cinderella is in this universe she

129
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,910
should be married to charming right if

130
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,170
you're gonna subvert fantasy movie at

131
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,380
least get your straight who wants their

132
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,799
happily ever

133
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,680
yeah charming ordered fuzzy navels for

134
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
everyone when he got to the bar but

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
Mabel hasn't made and the rest of the

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
place has been busy threatening him for

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,289
the last two minutes so where the hell

138
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,940
did these drinks come from also it's not

139
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,530
really a fuzzy navel I thought it's just

140
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,629
peach and orange juice but it's got like

141
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,699
pineapple and lime and I mean it could

142
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,169
be a fuzzy navel just like the drink

143
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,759
Jason Bateman orders in game night could

144
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,379
be a Harvey Wallbanger but I'm sending

145
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,180
it until I receive confirmation I don't

146
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,330
know you but I like to Wieck and none of

147
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,190
the other cats speak these cartoons are

148
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,120
really gonna have to get to the bottom

149
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,919
of this animal language puzzle also a

150
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,569
man this franchise assumes people have a

151
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,099
lot of interest in anthropomorphize

152
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,150
sexual activity

153
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,039
oh so also why can't Fionna go on this

154
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,990
voyage - Arthur is her family right and

155
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,520
she's been a badass up until now I

156
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,139
remember that matrix bolt against Robin

157
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,340
Hood in the first movie sure she's

158
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,880
pregnant

159
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,919
but Shrek doesn't know that I knew my

160
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,300
friend I royally what screwed is that

161
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,800
any worse than the Frog king thing this

162
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
movie got away with earlier movie that

163
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,860
barely scratches featurelength has time

164
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,690
for an extended dream sequence better

165
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,479
out than in I always say yes you do in

166
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,789
every incorrect movie when a man has a

167
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,009
certain feelings for a woman I know how

168
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,169

169
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,240

170
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,099
finishing on Fiona's - how does it

171
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,150
happen dude if you're gonna make this

172
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,469
joke make it with the character that

173
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:32,969
hasn't already fathered at least five

174
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,740
offspring when have you ever heard the

175
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,469
phrase as sweet as an ogre or as

176
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,889
nurturing as an ogre we can get it odors

177
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,330
are terrible you're worried about that

178
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,310
Jesus give it a rest had a trick even

179
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,750
know where to go Harold only got out

180
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,430
Arthur's name before he croaked and it

181
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,779
didn't even seem like lily and knew he

182
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,699
existed bro don't burn all my

183
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,130
frankincense in man yes at least one of

184
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,539
the screenwriters fought tooth and bond

185
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,069
keep this fucking stoner joke in the

186
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,779
script congratulations guy who wrote

187
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,419
Caddyshack - and wild wild west by how

188
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,430
did you receive the wedgies when you are

189
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,349
clearly not aware of the Underpants

190
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:05,789
let's just say some things are better

191
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,409
left unsaid and leave it at that the

192
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,880
only reason you were leaving this unset

193
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,469
is because it is a total lie the fact

194
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,789
that donkey is even leaving something

195
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,710
unsaid is proof enough for me so then I

196
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,150
was all like I rather get the Black

197
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,860
Plague and lock myself in an Iron Maiden

198
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,849
than go out with you

199
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,380
lines like this illustrate why movies

200
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,819
like Shrek should stay at one or two

201
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,560
chapters because every single time the

202
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,150
dialogue peppers medieval references

203
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,310
into modern lingo begins to pile up and

204
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,050
become stale

205
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,370
man this will be so derivative of other

206
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,230
movies that I totally believe that horse

207
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,340
just got hit by a golf ball remind me

208
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,390
why we're in high school for this

209
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,620
sequence I mean I guess it's

210
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,150
tangentially related to the Arthurian

211
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,610
fable but in high school what sense does

212
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,380
it make to any of this goddamn story

213
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,420
thank you to Professor Prynne bottom and

214
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,670
is invigorating lecture on how to just

215
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,100
say no I mean do you see what I mean

216
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,110
they got a million of them folks already

217
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,340
a king more like the mayor of Loserville

218
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,870
jeez even when the movie appears to try

219
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,490
to be self-aware it's so stupid you

220
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,720
think it might actually be serious

221
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,360
wait babies poop everyone poops Beauty

222
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,340
I'm adding a hundred sins for the poop

223
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,900
jokes in the anachronistic way people

224
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,190
talk in this movie it's goddamn

225
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,860
nauseating also this is a quick ass baby

226
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,270
shower right Shrek can have been gone

227
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,770
long we've only seen one night pass

228
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,690
Dover babies fully just eat in less than

229
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,200
a week I don't care what fantasy land

230
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,670
you're living in there is no way they

231
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,420
could expect Fiona to fit into that no

232
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,650
way dragon saw these assholes

233
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,240
approaching especially since we've seen

234
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
how she is it guarding castles in the

235
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,580
previous movies I see someone got the

236
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,870
Golden Snitch what the hell are the

237
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,490
trees from anyway if they're ents from

238
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,960
Lord of the Rings then they wouldn't be

239
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,370
villains if they're from blizzard of Oz

240
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,410
then they're really also not feelings

241
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,180
and they should be sporting apples in

242
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,800
what someone please tell me the logic of

243
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,660
this joke how does chasing people out of

244
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,920
a booter II suddenly turn it into

245
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,780
hooters I think the joke is that you can

246
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,300
easily change booter e into hooters and

247
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,280
I'm sorry I just don't get it to the

248
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,020
console why didn't they go there in the

249
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,490
first place then they now have to climb

250
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,960
up to the castle on foot just because

251
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,210
they wanted to do some light looting

252
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,590
stupids this line is appropriate because

253
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,090
this movie is definitely funnier than

254
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,430
the 1996 Tom Arnold vehicle the stupids

255
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,510
and that's about it

256
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,820
last time movie thinks it's got a cool

257
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,130
reflective shot but if hook is truly

258
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,750
threatening gingerbread man directly to

259
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,190
his face this is an impossible angle

260
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,890
screw me now everyone in this universe

261
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,400
goes to high school

262
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,830
couldn't exactly not say this or is

263
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,240
let's combine all the stuff that's

264
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,500
terrible about this movie with the

265
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,839
shrill character voices and guys so I

266
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,099
might have to stop sending this movie

267
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,100
it's that freaking awful the sink

268
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,480
counter says I have to finish this and I

269
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,980
always do what the master sets I just

270
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,390
figured everyone forgot about me

271
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,800
well it did get a little funky after you

272
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
left didn't sink but just to find was

273
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,510
the man I'm going back to what how is

274
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,440
this even a struggle

275
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,820
Shrek's been shown to have incredible

276
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,320
strength and newbies gone to great

277
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,760
lengths to show us what a pipsqueak

278
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,770
already is even if he's in panic mode

279
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,400
far far away from you you get back here

280
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,050
young man and I mean it guy and we'll

281
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,610
soon be a father learns fathering with

282
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,140
the surrogate son during an adventure

283
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,450
cliche I was merely a victim of a level

284
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,790
3 fatigue and at the request of my

285
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,710
therapist this is Eric idols voice right

286
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,210
because it sounds so much like John

287
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,770
Oliver then I'll never be able to listen

288
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,330
to John Oliver again without thinking he

289
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,130
stole Erik idols mojo to further his

290
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,890
career this is lame wow you're late

291
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,330
somehow the argument between Justin

292
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,680
Timberlake and the director made it into

293
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,080
the actual movie I get it my dad left

294
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,060
so what Luther issues whenever the movie

295
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,740
finds itself in a run somebody sings or

296
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,480
plays a modern song that was popular in

297
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,610
its day but relatively obscure now for

298
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,470
all the laps and inevitably all the

299
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,970
other characters hate the song and scorn

300
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,260
the person for singing and or playing it

301
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,700
Scooby is so tired that it's practically

302
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,890
is equal maybe it just bothers you that

303
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,529
I was voted fairest in the land man in a

304
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,360
sea of bad scenes made by talented

305
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,890
people in this movie the Princess seams

306
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,839
are absolutely the baddest we're gonna

307
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,760
get inside and find out what charmings

308
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,470
up - how does Fiona know that it was

309
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,670
Prince Charming that attacked the castle

310
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,529
he was way too far away for her to see

311
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:10,029
him before they escaped and even if she

312
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:11,380
had seen him there were like dozens of

313
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,430
other well-known villains that could

314
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,810
have been the ringleader but how long

315
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,040
have they been wandering the catacombs

316
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,140
like minutes right maybe a couple hours

317
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,670
but in that time Charming's taken over

318
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,350
the entire city and carved out an image

319
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,330
of his head into the hedges if rapunzel

320
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,950
was on charming side this whole time why

321
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,180
did she even bother going into the

322
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,410
secret passage with the rest of the

323
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,620
princesses flipping the bird also a

324
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,150
movie franchise can't resist the chance

325
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,890
to kill yet another bird as if it's got

326
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,950
a vendetta or some if the trees are this

327
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,630
angry and been here this whole night

328
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,130
then why didn't they attack them in

329
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,730
their sleep Oh

330
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,800
hooks piano blow up the whole plans

331
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,390
ruined run for it even though we have

332
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,830
nowhere to go I know you

333
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,050
do it I said forget it character says

334
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,250
he's not going to do something before

335
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,870
immediately doing that thing cliche

336
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,940
I've been abracadabra into a fancy face

337
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,650
and second-rate sidekick there's an

338
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,480
actual plot to this movie or was this

339
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,550
entire thing greenlit as is after the

340
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,900
first brainstorming meeting yeah you

341
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,060
should feel all exposed nasty what is he

342
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,840
talking about

343
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,370
donkey doesn't wear pants this is the

344
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,780
second time donkeys mentioned something

345
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,190
about pants look there's some weird

346
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,420
character trait where he's delusional

347
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,370
about pants he suddenly wears how did

348
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,120
far far away

349
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,650
shut down so quickly again it's only

350
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,600
been a few days since Trek even left so

351
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,010
even though charming took over the whole

352
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,360
city wouldn't end up like Hill Valley

353
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,920
and back to the future too that quickly

354
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,390
if you need to put five bucks into this

355
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,340
machine to see Pinocchio then who put

356
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,600
five bucks in the first time look at

357
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,860
this scene you can see the machine on

358
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,480
the left with Pinocchio inside of it did

359
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,590
the witch that's walking away from it

360
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,820
put five dollars into the Machine and

361
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,770
leave there's this machine along he's a

362
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,090
star people

363
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,360
hello I'm so sorry about this mr. Shrek

364
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,440
this is some how it works

365
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,930
who told you to stop dancing Wow Carmen

366
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,610
got a lot of authoritarian capital out

367
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,290
of one rousing speech at the bar and a

368
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,760
round of fuzzy navels let me guess

369
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,990
awesome how does everyone now know who

370
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,610
arthur is when the King only just

371
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,440
mentioned to him on his deathbed he's an

372
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,410
ogre what did you expect whoa hold on

373
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,060
now wait just a fucking second are you

374
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,740
telling me Shrek isn't a girl when did

375
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,280
this happen

376
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,960
why didn't anyone say anything so

377
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,910
they're just gonna let him go the second

378
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,350
rightful heir to the throne charming is

379
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,550
still planning on killing Tripp right

380
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,860
seriously this is the second sad music

381
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,330
montage for the movie and by my

382
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,190
unofficial count the 47th of the

383
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,810
franchise also the song that's playing

384
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,880
is Damien Rice's nine crimes which is

385
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,130
about infidelity in Jesus movie whose

386
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,810
because a song is slow and dour doesn't

387
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,490
mean it's perfect for a sad moment damn

388
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,530
this is a big castle to only have one

389
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,180
cell to put all the dissidents in

390
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,680
together

391
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,970
I suppose the journal about Sleeping

392
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,590
Beauty is that she's a narcoleptic and I

393
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,850
understand that the deal with these

394
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,410
Shrek movies is to be irreverent and

395
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,300
interpret fairy tales in a skewed and

396
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,470
humorous manner but knowing that

397
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,150
Sleeping Beauty only fell into her deep

398
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,920
deep sleep because of a curse and not

399
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,030
because of some sort of sleeping

400
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,650
disorder makes me wonder how long anyone

401
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,730
thought about giving her more of a

402
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,140
character than the tired narcolepsy

403
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,019
nonsense

404
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,160
if she could do this why didn't you do

405
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,850
it earlier okay because I mean also see

406
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,209
there's a whole other cell right there

407
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:56,890
why don't you just fight out dialogue

408
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,810
was personally approved by Roger Goodell

409
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,519
just now to have it this is funny and

410
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,930
all but it's guaranteed that when we see

411
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,279
all these women again no one will be

412
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,810
sporting a pair of pokies consistent

413
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,399
with the choice who would have thought a

414
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,740
monster like me deserves something as

415
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:17,620
special as you man you think there'd be

416
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,940
a better way into the castle than this

417
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,860
overly complicated plant like couldn't

418
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,269
Lillian have just head-butted an

419
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:26,140
interior wall Wow hey how's it gone see

420
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,760
it's funny because she's ugly even

421
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,899
though she's apparently got attractive

422
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,329
legs and guys are horny laughing yet he

423
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:33,459
was using me that's all there is to it

424
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,410
Shrek only said those things to protect

425
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,149
you this is one of the only times when

426
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,860
saying something or not saying something

427
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,510
in order to protect you is actually used

428
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,459
correctly but my sins filter still wants

429
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,870
to sin it simply because they said those

430
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,640
magic words that I hate so after Prince

431
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,380
Charming became king he still wanted to

432
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,760
put on this stupid play about beating

433
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,290
Shrek like he did at the beginning of

434
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,760
the movie when he was clearly at his

435
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,649
lowest point oh just be king not like he

436
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,149
even knew Shrek was in line to be the

437
00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:04,510
heir look is this movie about really

438
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,949
wish they had given this warning at the

439
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,660
beginning of the movie that's actually a

440
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,910
very nice leotard thank you did they

441
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,800
come in men's sizes this has got to be

442
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,660
like the fifth man is a woman joke in

443
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,279
the movie but I'm too pissed at it to go

444
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,839
check just like every Shrek movie the

445
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,279
dragon comes into X Mach and other

446
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,540
proceedings feel like they could just

447
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,100
take this dragon anywhere and no one

448
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,690
would ever put them during their stupid

449
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,760
schemes but Who am I to judge I'm not

450
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,440
even mad about the stupid poop joke I'm

451
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,209
just sad that everyone fucking does this

452
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,890
joke and it's neither funny nor clever

453
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,390
no matter what character is doing it

454
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,100
there was no screwing things this time

455
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,250
oh go kids but make sure to do it all

456
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,810
slow and stuff so I can actually finish

457
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,519
jerking off for once the thing that

458
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,290
matters most is what you think of

459
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:41,800
yourself

460
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,110
is anyone buying this as a speech really

461
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,390
gonna turn the tide here god dammit holy

462
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,180
this could not be more telegraph but no

463
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,649
one moved a muscle except the one

464
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,970
motherfucker who's chained to the floor

465
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,130
yeah the guy we've never met no I heard

466
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,110
about is going to be keying whoo I have

467
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,580
something much more important

468
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,710
mind what so shrek school with the

469
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,060
Fatherhood now he just faced down an

470
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,530
asshole that wanted to kill him and let

471
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,120
Artie take over as king and nothing

472
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,320
about that would prepare him for having

473
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,420
a kid plus I had a perfect Cameron Diaz

474
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,250
audio outtake from Vanilla Sky queued up

475
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,110
for whatever Fiona inevitably yelled at

476
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,000
Trek for being a dick dammit this movie

477
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,070
for that alone please I guess everyone

478
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,360
thought this guy was going to be such a

479
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,890
hit that the filmmakers gave him another

480
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,420
scene at the end that's too bad

481
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,410
I was kind of hoping they forgot about I

482
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,530
hate so much about the things that you

483
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:36,310
choose to be working if you think this

484
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,030
whole mad scene ain't dope I feel you

485
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,430
don't mess with me I'm one crazy mofo I

486
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,050
had to pop a cop because he wasn't

487
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,200
giving my props in Oaktown so so just go

488
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,910
I'm gone get it

489
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:58,720
I am go I'm gone coconut and you're

490
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,860
banging him together

491
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,460
once upon a time someone decided that we

492
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,690
were the losers

493
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:18,230
and get in my belly Fox force five Fox

494
