1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
we're shooting all kinds of videos in here to her actual people in actual

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,110
people in this spot but hotel manager is just so the boys and two video cameras

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,110
nobody

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,530
yeah

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,250
yeah

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:41,250
644 in the morning we slept 0 last night we stayed up the whole night working

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,630
which is great

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,780
I just showered and shaved and I feel like a million bucks

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,640
flight is in a couple of hours now i'm staying at this ridiculous hotel and I

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,840
want to do a hotel room torques it's so dope here but because we're up all night

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,670
eating like junk food room service

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,149
the place is kind of a mess so here is my dope belfast hotel room tour a strict

13
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,149
sorry for being such a total mess

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,229
you enter through this foyer which just lovely

15
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,229
then walk into the main better

16
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,289
this is the main bedroom but there's no bed in the bedroom

17
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:24,750
you have to leave this room and go into this room to get into the bedroom

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,090
the bedroom was great but the bed still made because I never slept in it

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,580
see this bathroom it's got my name on it but just a great bedroom

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,689
this bedroom would be considered one of the nicer hotels i've ever been but the

21
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,750
Barons only a part of this room the bathroom over here is really more like a

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,090
one person spa

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,920
there's this like amazing nearer showers that way you know what's that way and is

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,030
backed up here which of course i didn't use is just awesome

25
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,160
the pattern of the federal was just really overall underused and we never

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,990
even came into this room

27
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,250
most of the time was spent over here this room was like this was like our

28
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,720
main operating base this is where we spent the whole night I mean like seven

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,890
straight hours just sitting here working and I didn't want to thank hotel

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,520
management

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,780
this lovely bottle of champagne we didn't drink it not because I didn't

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,590
appreciate the gesture but we had to work in champaign plus work just been

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,490
really mad

34
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,820
this is the bar that's like a proper real bar right here it's a little

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,920
disgusting right now but it wasn't this discussing we got here and fries pita

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,320
coffee soda

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,010
you know we had a non later really though the magic doesn't begin until you

38
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,030
outside

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,700
sure the views amazing but also private hot tub and look at the sheer amount of

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,930
real mistake

41
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,459
I mean this patty of years bigger than my apartment that you mind this all in

42
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,459
all though I really like we took advantage of this hotel

43
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,620
I was just thinking we should go to the spa

44
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:10,450
yeah then let's do it ok this is not like a wake up at six in the morning

45
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,220
time of hotel so we have to be a little quiet and we have roles with our names

46
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,220
on the shot

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,860
good

48
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,690
do you know where you're going now just follow the provide

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,740
it seems right

50
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,790
where's the spot dude all right morning were this

51
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,209
where's the the snow room smaller means i picked them in their projects

52
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:53,030
this is where the snow room is and I sure hope so

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not even kidding look how slippery that's it

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,230
that

55
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,330
yeah

56
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,110
you have to start of the first cold

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,390
yeah

58
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,799
I didn't get very far it's like saying looking over there not slippery and all

59
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,060
right here

60
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,060
whoa

61
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:28,560
where does this snow come from Sean we gotta put on our swimsuits and get just

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,050
think real slow

63
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,700
what's that noise

64
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,660
I've never been much of a spot

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
this place is incredible

66
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,020
this pool is impressive and all the church out these bits

67
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,639
heated water mattress

68
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,460
the one who play school this is like the dry heat room

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,770
about a hundred and thirty degrees in here that's like 50 degrees Celsius

70
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,770
this isn't really my liking yes

71
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,550
this is the snow room you hope to get out it three

72

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,480
us out and drove us to the airport but there was no car

75
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,810

76
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,030
can't miss this flight Sean i'm hoping so hard that we don't miss it

77
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,030
the decision not to sleep last night starting to kick in

78
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,700

79
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,700

I cannot wait to get on the plane and just fall sound asleep

93
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,380

you know the gate number 22

95
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,460

96
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,460
