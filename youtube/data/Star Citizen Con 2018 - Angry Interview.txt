1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,000
hey guys I got a big long star citizen

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,339
interview or I really press some of the

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,480
questions get some nitty gritty details

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,740
and things like that but I did want to

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,400
preface it here because I wasn't I

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,619
didn't plan for it it's in Austin I

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,810
missed the first portion of it because I

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,699
was live-streaming it with you guys then

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,529
I went down there didn't bring some

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:23,970
lighting equipment certain things like

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,310
that and they didn't really have an area

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,260
set up for interview so lighting doesn't

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,789
look that good I'm just telling you this

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,349
cuz I'm really proud of the way we're

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,850
kind of improving the show but it

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,520
doesn't look too good but I did my job

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,520
which is a basically asking them some of

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,500
the tough questions letting them talk a

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,570
little bit about the the features that

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,040
they're showing off and things like that

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,780
but we mainly had a lot of concerns

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,940
about the economy the prices of things

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,899
and things like that

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,000
so that's why it gets a little long the

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,559
first guy Brian couldn't answer those

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,199
questions I do a second interview and

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,780
the second guy Tony was able to sort of

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,520
go into those detail now I'm not gonna

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,350
give you any sort of final impressions

30
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,600
angry rant or what I actually think of

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,250
the whole thing that's gonna be in a

32
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,170
separate video where we give you our

33
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,850
personal breakdown because obviously I

34
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,890
can't really do that mix that into the

35
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,350
interview so I want to kind of leave

36
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,000
this out here for you guys and hopefully

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,580
it's an enjoyable watch for people out

38
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,799
there that are wondering what heck is

39
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,960
going on with star citizen how long is

40
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,189
it man how long is it gonna take

41
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,040
etcetera stuff like that people like me

42
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,220
cuz I originally backed it I think 2011

43
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,829
I have no idea okay so I hope you guys

44
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,659
enjoy the interview sorry about the

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,390
quality but that will improve in the

46
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,400
future okay thank you so much and please

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,009
enjoy the interview hey guys angry Joe

48
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,810
here and I'm with Bryan chambers the

49
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,210
development director and cloud Imperium

50
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,259
games for star citizen so we just saw

51
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,610
the keynote for 2018 by the way you guys

52
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,990
have been doing this how many years now

53
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,189
we've been working hard for a while yeah

54
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,159
and we I came to the first time that you

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
guys had a convention in Austin came to

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,799
that one was real exciting and and then

57
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,209
I kind of fell off because I don't know

58
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,530
what's going on with the game people

59
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,250
like me who backed it you know initially

60
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,260
have been waiting a long time and then I

61
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,970
heard rumors that this one might be you

62
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,800
know super exciting there's some stuff

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,550
going down exactly so I came checked it

64
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,020
out the keynote was awesome

65
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,990
like I did not expect a lot of the stuff

66
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,850
that you guys showed ah yeah we actually

67
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,130
I heard it from a lot of people before

68
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,170
the keynote they were like man you guys

69
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,090
did a really good job of keeping your

70
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,010
your lips tight we don't know what we're

71
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,810
gonna see but we've heard stuff yeah

72
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,480
that's like coming from the outside

73
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,490
looking in because I'm expecting a space

74
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,950
sim to be delivered to me what I saw

75
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,600
here is I saw ground combat I saw almost

76
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,820
like an RPG you know we're going through

77
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,640
a town where there's a large focus on

78
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,130
immersion as we're going through the hub

79
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,650
areas and we got a mission in

80
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,870
specifically with a satellite we got to

81
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,060
find this downed satellite and I was

82
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,440
wondering is this one of those missions

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,720
that's a long this is single-player

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,459
we're looking at or is this multiplayer

85
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,410
this is both I mean you can grab it by

86
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,900
yourself you can go on with your friends

87
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,239
and attack it and it's just one example

88
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,049
of a type of mission that we put

89
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,769
together we'll go through you know we'll

90
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:25,970
look at all the elements that we're

91
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,380
putting together the transit system

92
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,570
right how do how doing this if we're

93
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,220
putting in new animation mechanics or

94
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,019
what-have-you and then we go okay cool

95
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,110
how how can we craft that into a mission

96
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,489
that we can show off all these elements

97
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,950
yeah there there's a lot of systems

98
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,630
going on here I think star citizen has

99
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,799
gotten bigger and bigger and bigger

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,380
since I contributed and I think that's

101
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,260
led to a few delays of the game and some

102
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,900
restarting of development work on the

103
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,340
game so some people are getting

104
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,900
impatient some people a little getting a

105
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,120
little upset that it's not out yet but

106
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,890
can you explain why that is it may be

107
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,630
it's not it's not yet ready yeah I mean

108
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,070
when I I look at it and I'm really close

109
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,660
to it right I've been on the project for

110
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,450
over three years now I don't see

111
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,310
anything is necessarily restarting but

112
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,610
when we look at what they're join when I

113
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,170
joined we looked at systems that were in

114
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,489
place right and we said as an example AI

115
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,470
where do we want AI to go how immersive

116
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,490
we want this to be right and

117
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,650
you know chris roberts set the bar of

118
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,750
where it's gonna be and we all said cool

119
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,639
we understand what the vision is once

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,139
you looked at the tech that was there

121
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,440
for AI we knew we had to build up the

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,210
foundation stronger mm-hmm

123
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,400
we needed to put what we've put together

124
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,069
called subsumption to be able to get the

125
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,860
AI to the level that it needs and we try

126
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,380
to be as AI challenging because that's

127
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,289
one of the things I saw in the game is

128
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,789
that because it's an how far what's

129
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,979
going on yeah absolutely on I mean the

130
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,310
base for subscription is done

131
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,259
Saburo all the AI behaviors from combat

132
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,229
AI to even chip AI right so it's there

133
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,539
but there's a reason why what you saw

134
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,759
today isn't out in everyone's hands yet

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
yeah we still need to get it where it's

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,750
massaged it's it's you know those

137
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,900
transitions and everything really you

138
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,409
know the moment it's off you lose the

139
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,389
immersion yeah right and that immersion

140
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,210
for us is huge I mean the the game looks

141
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,500
amazing I want star citizen to succeed

142
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,060
obviously there was a little bit of you

143
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,340
know embarrassing moments it did crash

144
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,500
when you're drinking coffee I mean what

145
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,449
happens when we go into fleet battles if

146
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,380
you're crashing when you're drinking

147
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,389
coffee right you know what I'm saying

148
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,180
but it's it's alpha and so that's what I

149
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,620
was giving you a chance to sort of

150
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,659
explain to backers like me who have been

151
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,900
waiting for six seven years now like if

152
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,460
you just said yeah we had to restart a

153
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,479
few times because we won't get

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,070
everything right you know we want we

155
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,229
injected planets in and we're doing this

156
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,229
and that meant that would bring my fears

157
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,969
at rest you know what I'm saying but if

158
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,650
you just been kind of spinning your

159
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,990
wheels on the same things and it's like

160
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,639
what's going on here for six you get

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,590
everything that we built up from from

162
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,719
physics and from a I getting the

163
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,940
procedural Tech in place then creating

164
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,229
the tools to be able to get the

165
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:15,909
procedural Tech to work the way it needs

166
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,889
to even a level of getting in and

167
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,810
there's probably new challenges the

168
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,699
biomes to work on the planets and to get

169
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,310
VFX tied into those biomes and the night

170
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,710
and day and the new physics grid and so

171
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,419
on and so on and so on yeah there has

172
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,150
been a lot of work that was put into

173
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,330
this that was maybe initially you know

174
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,550
not looked at at the level of detail

175
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,280
is now with the team the size we are I

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,160
know the team intimately right I know

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,250
what the vision is and I know where

178
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,730
we're going and what we're doing right

179
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,140
more than confident that we're gonna get

180
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,910
there right and I think you're gonna see

181
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,830
well I know you're gonna see the pace

182
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,010
get more and more and more right just

183
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,350
this last week when you look at PT you

184
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,410
which is our early testbed right we

185
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,350
stepped it up with OCS object containers

186
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,580
streaming it's getting more and more

187
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,080
mature we got to build out there for

188
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,670
people to beat up we've been pushing

189
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,980
twice a day now yeah so twice a day

190
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,110
people are getting a new build right if

191
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,090
I go from what I've heard Oh back years

192
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,950
and years I mean okay here's a build

193
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,320
here yeah here's a build here right the

194
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,560
amount of work that's getting put in

195
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,030
successfully yeah and then compiled into

196
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,650
a build and pushed out to the public

197
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,180
that pace is increasing in you guys are

198
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,970
focusing on that transparency that that

199
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,220
constant updates to the community but

200
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,540
from what I've been hearing it's mostly

201
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,910
like a tech demo kind of thing where you

202
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,200
have different aspects where you're

203
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,180
going in and your experience I'm

204
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,610
wondering when I can come in and be like

205
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,250
let's play this thing and this is what

206
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,660
we're this is the star citizen

207
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,790
experience is that three point three is

208
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,410
that three point four is that five point

209
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,540
two is that six point seven what what is

210
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,250
that there's nothing you can really pin

211
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,240
down cuz with the PU it's always gonna

212
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,920
grow and grow the universe so if you

213
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
look at the persistent universe that's

214
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,860
gonna grow and grow for years and years

215
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,160
right you'll see we have a road map that

216
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,270
takes it out for the next couple

217
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,980
releases so we're transparent on what's

218
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,080
gonna be there yeah right people will

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,060
get an indication we're getting more and

220
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,280
more sandbox stuff that's in there I

221
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,010
mean people can play it now yeah however

222
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,100
yeah limited in the full scope and it's

223
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,050
not it's not what the full vision is

224
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,840
yeah right we know that but again a team

225
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,570
of 450 developers all right you know can

226
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,130
I stand here and give you an exact date

227
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,720
of when you'll have the best experience

228
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,630
no no right but I'm confident with the

229
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,630
team we have

230
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,430
everyday we're working our butts off to

231
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,080
push it further and further and further

232
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,210
I do see the war some people will say

233
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,040
you know okay once there's five solar

234
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,990
five systems in we're good

235
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,850
other people say no just two are good

236
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,490
some people say I want 50 it's really

237
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,100
it's really ones interpretation right

238
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,050
but I know I've seen the roadmap I know

239
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,490
where we're going yeah I know the steps

240
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,140
we've taken and I would say over the

241
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,480
last you know last couple years we have

242
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,280
worked incredibly hard to build that

243
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,290
foundation up on the tech side right

244
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,790
again with physics with the base

245
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,430
rendering with animation you name it

246
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,520
yeah and so from what I saw on the tech

247
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
demo like I said I really enjoyed it if

248
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,400
that's that contact demo okay demo just

249
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,860
to clarify yeah it's a demo right it's

250
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,620
is that mission in the game it's in the

251
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,050
game at the build in my office yes okay

252
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,460
cool cool we just haven't given it yet

253
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,200
so what Chris said which is honestly

254
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,750
true what we showed you that's the build

255
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,820
that we're working with right right and

256
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,340
that content is in there okay perfect if

257
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,200
there's there was nothing fake there I

258
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,320
know nobody is claiming that it's fake

259
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,610
what they're saying is what hey so long

260
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,140
and it's because they've restarted

261
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,080
development a few times to get some I

262
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,280
understand challenges you know hey we

263
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,990
got it we got to fix things as we just

264
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,030
know there's not been a game like this

265
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,880
before honestly III can't think of one

266
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,010
that is this ambitious you know what I'm

267
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,900
saying so obviously right exactly don't

268
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,500
amber you john-boy

269
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,390
okay but but I do have to ask the hard

270
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,830
questions and brass tacks towards the

271
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,140
end of the demo like I was enjoying it

272
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,180
it reminds the music whoever you are for

273
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,400
the music excellent it was reminding me

274
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,430
a Blade Runner the elements to it looked

275
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,740
like you know a little bit of deus ex a

276
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,150
little bit of Mass Effect so those are

277
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,250
all good things because it helps players

278
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,710
immerse themselves in the world however

279
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,950
at the end I was like wait what so we

280
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,320
spent about an hour on this deployed

281
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,780
satellite side mission and it only gave

282
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,050
us about 4,000 credits as our reward we

283
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,510
also lost our ship by the way I got shot

284
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,280
down we got baby that

285
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,890
and then we went to go to the not the

286
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,420
renter because you can rent ships but

287
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,470
you could buy ships and the ship cost 1

288
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,720
million credits and I did the math on

289
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,200
this Brian it's like some somewhere

290
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,270
upwards of two hundred and thirty days

291
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,570
24 hours every single day 231 days

292
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,470
what's your problem

293
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,760
that's the almost are those numbers

294
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,430
accurate because obviously that is

295
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,040
geared towards hey you pay a seven

296
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
hundred and fifty dollars for the ship

297
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,030
rather than gravy just what you saw

298
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,490
there was that systems in place right

299
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,280
huh you do a thing I earn some I can go

300
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,530
to a thing I'd buy something yeah all of

301
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,210
those numbers in the Kimani they all

302
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,070
have to be tuned in yeah now there's

303
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,110
just so many questions is what I'm

304
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,190
saying yeah it's it's it's special it's

305
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,080
awesome you're gonna need this thing are

306
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,330
you gonna you'd be a huge advantage if

307
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,560
you had this ship and it's really

308
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,160
expensive

309
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,530
I don't mind grinding for weeks maybe

310
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,680
even months but years people have jobs

311
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,870
and things I need to take care of so I'm

312
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,730
just worried about how the economy is

313
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,010
going to be balanced is what I'm saying

314
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,089
because if if lumps been in that much

315
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,620
time or I'm spending seven hundred and

316
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,270
fifty dollars and somebody comes over

317
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,000
and steals my ship they in and half a

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,750
second my my $750 ship is gone can you

319
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,400
explain how that would work because

320
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,160
these are serious concerns that people

321
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,260
solve from the demo they're like okay my

322
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,720
ship is very expensive yeah I don't want

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,550
to lose it so if somebody steals your

324
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,160
ship what then happens yeah yeah does it

325
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,120
disappear the next first of all as far

326
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,460
as you know how much do I get and how

327
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,400
much yeah you don't hold that okay oh

328
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,810
that's proper we're not going to make

329
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,740
somebody play for three and a half years

330
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:39,640
[Music]

331
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,100
can I steal a Kraken instead of span and

332
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,510
you know that much money and then I've

333
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,460
got a Kraken for the angry army you know

334
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,560
and or does that crack and get taken

335
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
away from me because it was only like on

336
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,640
loan for 24 hours because I stole it you

337
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,990
know that kind of stuff is what people

338
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,490
want

339
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,880
right now I think in the coming would

340
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,399
the coming months will get more and more

341
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,080
information okay right okay these

342
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,660
systems as we show today it scared me

343
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,200
that's well that's why I saw what Bob

344
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,160
they're getting on and more and more

345
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,800
mature okay as they get more mature and

346
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,570
what I literally was just having this

347
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,140
discussion

348
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,810
yeah with todd papy earlier today after

349
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,760
the demo is called what we call

350
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,920
hardening right we get all those base

351
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,870
systems in there we now need to sit down

352
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,310
and we need to balance and we need to

353
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,930
look at all those edge cases yeah and we

354
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,459
need to make sure that that experience

355
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,130
is fun it's engaging it's difficult when

356
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,649
it needs to be it's it's immersive right

357
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,390
yeah and that's really once you get

358
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,399
those core systems in that's that next

359
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,050
step we take exactly and these are fair

360
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,040
questions I'm not trying to be overly

361
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,200
hard on you guys because I'm excited I

362
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,260
want my own crack and if I've been at

363
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,060
$750 nobody better take that away from

364
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,680
me and then I never have it against can

365
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,170
you clean the insurance like if I is

366
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,630
that per ship like how does that how

367
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,720
does the banging man these are things

368
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,060
that where we need to know when are we

369
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:05,470
gonna know well you'll tell us how it's

370
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,209
designed yeah if they were here right

371
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,160
now they would give you an I just as

372
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,320
hard Todd would talk for an hour upon

373
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,209
how insurance works right yeah so you

374
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,500
guys are gonna have to think about this

375
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,760
when we open it up to our citizens ready

376
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,730
complex of it no no I hundred percent

377
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,190
okay I mean we know what we're doing and

378
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,720
we know where we're going right

379
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,430
the act of creating a new system right

380
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,070
the concept of that system and how it's

381
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,110
gonna work on paper is just a small

382
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,089
portion of it then you get in all the

383
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,070
portions of how does this work in

384
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,720
conjunction with everything else yeah

385
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,540
how do we put this in place oh the paper

386
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,680
the player doesn't you know get screwed

387
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,130
over during game play we was gonna be

388
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,450
parts we want you to grind who's gonna

389
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,890
be parts we want you to be difficult

390
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,180
right there's gonna be parser weak I

391
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,800
don't mind a grind no there are other

392
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,399
games out there that have a grind

393
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,560
sorry right right so it's a bit of a

394
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,390
balance but yeah yeah I mean you're fair

395
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,949
to ask the question yeah thank you and

396
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,150
one more question and I'm sorry

397
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,330
it's just so the fast fast travel right

398
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,070
yeah how is that gonna work because I

399
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,110
see the first few times I'm gonna do

400
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,580
what y'all did in the demo I'm gonna be

401
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,170
like slow and I'm really looking at this

402
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,910
I'm like oh that's real and then I'm

403
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,280
gonna jump but then you know the the fit

404
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,350
satellite or whatever mission I'm gonna

405
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,360
be like okay I got my thing let me fast

406
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,970
travel to this city can I go from this

407
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,770
city on this planet to fast travel to

408
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,660
another city on another planet instead

409
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,760
of having to get on my fly for 30

410
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,370
minutes so we could there's fast travels

411
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,890
and if you're just on planetary traveler

412
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,420
there's gonna be certain options but

413
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,740
from planet to planet there's different

414
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,030
options yeah I'm just wondering if that

415
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,650
was a design decision where it's like we

416
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,720
want to force players into the immersion

417
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,970
that yes you have to you have to drive

418
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,300
[Music]

419
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,550
yeah I mean when I'm on a planet and I

420
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,140
have a certain ship I'm gonna max out a

421
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,460
circle yeah there's certain amount yeah

422
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,350
yeah yeah so we even have this

423
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,360
discussion when we show this current

424
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,040
mission that we did today we go wait

425
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,560
going from here to here that's gonna

426
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,110
take like 12 minutes right are we sure

427
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,820
we want to do that yeah but we make the

428
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,650
choice because we like what was it the

429
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,020
choice was absolutely let's go A to B

430
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,880
because it's what it's what it is yeah

431
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,970
it is an immersive RPG slash space

432
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,730
combat simulator that RPG element is

433
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,210
coming in real real hard yeah it's as

434
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,160
systems come online we show off what we

435
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,650
have okay right so we've done you know

436
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,810
here's some combat AI cool band let's

437
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,440
show it off

438
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,300
hey that's we've just done this cool

439
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,760
we're gonna show it off right so what

440
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,320
you see is is a 100% true indication of

441
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,150
where we're currently at with the builds

442
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,670
we have back in our offices five of them

443
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,470
worldwide well that's what we're playing

444
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,690
with all right so to remedy it seems

445
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,970
like you know from what I'm seeing here

446
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,770
it's really really impressive there

447
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,540
there are little economy concerns and

448
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,070
you guys say maybe that's not finalized

449
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,200
yet right it's not I'm not concerned

450
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,970
about that I know that's gonna be

451
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,380
balanced and dialed in all right so

452
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,420
we'll get news updates when y'all are

453
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,220
ready for that and then some of these

454
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,950
other you know quality of life issues

455
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,570
that's something that you can look and

456
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,370
hear from your community or you guys

457
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,890
sent very reactive to your community

458
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,900
saying look this is it we're so reactive

459
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,350
okay every single day and I'm all over

460
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,579
the place every single day I'm in

461
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,790
spectrum I'm watching people stream

462
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,230
everybody is people are coming to us

463
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,440
with advice some of its legit some of

464
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,610
its right you all right right but you

465
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,770
know and even with the PTU crowd and the

466
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,150
evocati and the different groups that we

467
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,370
throw it to the feedback we get

468
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,650
we don't pivot and react on everything

469
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,420
but if we hear unanimous voice that

470
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,520
comes towards us and we go oh wait hold

471
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
on there is that one thing if I did this

472
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,480
and this and this and this and this this

473
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,970
happens right then yeah absolutely okay

474
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,440
we are very very reactive in the

475
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,760
community well we're looking to hear

476
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,370
more on those details is that it still

477
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,080
has me concerned everything is looking

478
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
really impressive I hope it works out

479
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,270
for you guys and we don't have any idea

480
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,260
when it's coming out because I usually

481
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,600
wrap up like a when does this thing come

482
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,320
out when is when is three point three

483
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,510
and four coming at point three is almost

484
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,020
almost out we like I said for the last

485
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,290
week I think it's been two pushes to PTU

486
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,679
a day so I can man I can imagine that

487
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,720
that's getting really really mature

488
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,570
every single day we are writing reports

489
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,850
we're not in a bad way not in a taxing

490
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,620
way but people see what we do every

491
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,970
single day right right I've been making

492
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,980
games for 25 no I've seen the wrong man

493
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,410
no I've been making games for 25 years

494
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,080
and never has there been this visibility

495
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,080
into what I do on a daily basis and what

496
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,080
my team does on a daily basis right it's

497
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,630
it's cool but it's incredibly unique as

498
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,100
well yeah yeah well I'm glad you guys

499
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,510
are here and I think that that is in

500
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,010
place because of your unique situation

501
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,559
how much has been fan invested into the

502
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,809
game and how long it's taken but you

503
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,280
guys it seems like you're on the right

504
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,679
track now the music is amazing the

505
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,140
visual I gotta give props to the art art

506
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,830
team man it's like the way it looks

507
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,720
amazing so amazing the level of detail

508
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,970
they go into every single picture that's

509
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,220
there and a lot of those biomes that you

510
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,710
saw that's procedurally done once we've

511
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,700
generated these assets we have delicious

512
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,130
just to get this thing done because III

513
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,570
think it's amazing what you guys are

know the demo glitchy but you know you

517
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,809
got some time to work on that all these

518
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,460
questions but these are the questions

519
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,740
that were asked to me to ask to you so

520
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,200

00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,610
hey guys angry Joe and I'm back I'm here

524
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,590
with Tony the director of the persistent

525
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,710
universe for star citizen and one

526
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,450
question I asked Brian that he wasn't

527
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,129
really he said you got you would be the

528
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,529
guy to ask on that and I want to be 100%

529
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,120
you know fair and get all the

530
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,700
information out there was pertaining to

531
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,549
the insurance for your ships now like I

532
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,190
told him I really enjoyed the keynote

533
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,889
the to our demonstration it was amazing

534
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,570
it looked great and then right at the

535
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,549
end it concerned me because it was like

536
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:25,250
the economy was like hey this ship is 21

537
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,950
million credits the mission we just did

538
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,080
for about an hour was only four thousand

539
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,990
credits something can okay let me say I

540
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,789
do put in the time to grind or I

541
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,830
purchased that ship on my own because I

542
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,110
don't want to do the grind is this ship

543
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,750
going to be taken away from me if I go

544
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,389
on on a mission and I have a pirate gild

545
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:47,659
show up and then they they manage to

546
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,450
take the ship away from me is all of the

547
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,299
work that I done gonna be completely

548
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,389
obliterated no we've got several things

549
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,889
in place that will protect against that

550
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,419
one is of course your ship would be

551
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:01,250
insured and so that all that you would

552
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,440
need to do if someone wound up taking

553
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,090
your ship is go back to the local

554
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,039
insurance office you file a claim at

555
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,980
that point the ship becomes mark stolen

556
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,289
anyone flying around and it would start

557
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,909
to attract the attention from security

558
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,070
etc so their life becomes more difficult

559
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,230
you are on it would now get a

560
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,779
replacement ship issued to you free of

561
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,269
charge if you've got LTI insurance there

562
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,389
may be depending upon you know depending

563
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,429
upon what type of ship there may be you

564
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,370
know a certain waiting time etc but in

565
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,019
general it's fairly easy to recover from

566
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,159
that the other thing you mentioned is

567
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,570
well only getting four thousand credits

568
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,000
it cost 21 million some of the larger

569
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,710
ships obviously we would in

570
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,350
and for a number of different players to

571
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,090
band together and purchase them you know

572
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,950
together as opposed to necessarily one

573
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,919
individual player okay makes sense it's

574
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,029
like for a guild because obviously

575
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:52,309
you're not gonna be off be able to

576
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,440
operate the crack in yourself okay

577
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,059
that's exactly and then one other thing

578
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,070
that one other things I would mention is

579
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,330
the fact that we're going to be

580
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,000
introducing the concept of being able to

581
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,669
rent ships and this is for the same

582
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:06,230
reason that if you think about when

583
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,809
people buy a car or people buy a house

584
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:16,360
they don't usually you know pay cash up

585
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,919
well maybe you want to test out that

586
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,750
prospect you don't know whether you

587
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,399
actually are going to want to be playing

588
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:23,600
that a month from now two months from

589
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,649
now three months from now four months

590
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:26,740
now and so what this allows you to do

591
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,000
with this concept of rentals that we'll

592
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,549
be introducing is try a ship out if you

593
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,470
like it you can either continue with the

594
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,120
payments for whatever you know whatever

595
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,279
yeah whatever it takes to basically

596
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,990
eventually you know own the thing or you

597
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,760
can try it out for one month and

598
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,320
basically switch to another ship where

599
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,460
you can basically try it for two for a

600
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,039
reduced costs that's okay and are we

601
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,049
able to pay real money to rent as well

602
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:50,690
or is that in-game only we haven't

603
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,919
worked out the details and stuff it's

604
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,679
just that a lot of the players that got

605
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,970
into the game they've got the one ship

606
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,679
they want to try some of the others and

607
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,289
so you'll hear more about the specifics

608
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:01,490
and stuff you know and they're not too

609
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,380
distant future it's just that that is

610
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,880
something that we definitely want to

611
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,289
support okay so I'm starting to

612
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,659
understand it a little bit better it

613
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,309
seems like you're not gonna be able to

614
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:12,470
get away scot-free stealing somebody's

615
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,840
crack in or high level ship that you're

616
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,690
always gonna be tagged as a pirate or as

617
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,679
stolen illegal property and you know so

618
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,870
it's gonna be sort of you can hold on to

619
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,059
it it's not just gonna disappear but

620
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,789
it's gonna make your life a living hell

621
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,890
will I actually talked about that in the

622
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,210
chat that I just gave I actually

623
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,980
wouldn't ok tale about this and

624
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,539
mentioned how we're going to start

625
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,580
introducing anti-theft devices so that

626
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,380
it's not as simple as just sitting down

627
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,240
in the pilot seat of someone else's ship

628
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,710
and then basically taking off these

629
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,809
ships represent tremendous stores of

630
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:46,730
value and so it is going to become

631
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,740
considerably more difficult to basically

632
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,509
take someone's ship and you

633
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,940
if you do wind up taking that ship like

634
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,169
I said it's like all they gonna do is

635
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,119
basically go file you know go file a

636
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,469
claim on it and Owens then it becomes

637
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,359
stolen property and once it's marked as

638
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,849
stolen property then your life really

639
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,259
does become a lot more difficult because

640
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,690
once you've got a stolen ship it's not

641
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,309
this way now but again I mentioned this

642
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,259
in the chat that I just did at that

643
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:12,559
point the the law-abiding shops repair

644
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,349
shops the refueling and things of that

645
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:15,859
sort

646
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,299
they're not gonna want to deal with you

647
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,739
know with stolen merchandise and so

648
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:21,049
you're gonna have to traipse off to the

649
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:23,209
lawless frontier or the criminal areas

650
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,129
in order to have your stolen ship get

651
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,929
serviced refueled repaired you know the

652
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,940
reloaded you know etc and of course the

653
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,319
prices out there are going to be more

654
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,059
expensive than when they would be more

655
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,399
secure zones etc and so there's going to

656
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,169
be a number of different ways by which

657
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,059
we're gonna attack you know attack this

658
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,769
particular problem okay give me a little

659
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,269
more confidence it seems like there's a

660
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,749
whole system in place to build this out

661
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,339
because I had people coming up to me

662
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:47,569
because the impression I got from the

663
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,239
keynote afterwards is like wow this is

664
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,459
sort of a little bit like the Wild West

665
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:55,249
in certain aspects and that's really

666
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:57,979
scary to put in any amount of time

667
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,379
investment into it versus you know a

668
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,269
sort of a directed hold your hand

669
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,099
experience through you know scripted

670
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:05,899
events once you've actually once you can

671
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:08,599
purchase the ship then there's really no

672
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,399
really the biggest danger that you would

673
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:13,190
face is if you've filed a certain number

674
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,779
of claims you know within a certain

675
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,549
period of time then you may have to wait

676
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,809
a little bit longer than you would

677
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,049
actually like or if you've got really

678
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,369
expensive you know and Idris but of

679
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,049
course an interest is a different type

680
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,639
of beast altogether you're not usually

681
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,079
going to be out flying your interests

682
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,629
yes solo it's gonna be you and 50 or 60

683
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,459
or any other guys and so if that

684
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,259
interest actually gets taken over by

685
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:35,599
some other guys and it takes you several

686
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,979
days before you can actually have

687
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,809
insurance fulfill that replacement

688
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,759
that's not really that out of the

689
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,199
ordinary you're talking about once

690
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:42,769
you're starting to talk about

691
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:44,239
battleships and aircraft carriers and

692
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,499
stuff like that you're not really gonna

693
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,659
you know tend to lose those things as

694
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,729
easily as you might Hornet to where I

695
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,440
hop out I basically go into the base

696
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,059
somebody jumps in the seat they take off

697
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,979
and I'm basically saying hey wait what

698
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,169
just happened right like Anakin

699
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,450
Skywalker could take that that

700
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,640
anyway so I was just thinking we had I

701
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,230
had a few guilts come up to me or our

702
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,430
clan members they're like hey Joe man

703
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,110
tell you what and they gave me their car

704
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,460
in here too they were like look if you

705
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,600
want one of them shits

706
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,820
you know come to us and we'll steal it

707
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,500
for you you know so I was like man this

708
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,810
is gonna be like the Wild West or and

709
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,070
I'm like if they could do that for me

710
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,170
and I'm gonna be streaming I'm gonna fly

711
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,640
my we're gonna be doing our thing I

712
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,280
won't be a huge ass target and I'm

713
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,200
thinking all this time that we put into

714
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,940
this thing it's gonna be taken away from

715
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,730
us and it's not another one I touched on

716
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,890
is how dramatically things like the

717
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,660
bounty hunter occupation are going to

718
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,730
change you know over the course of the

719
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,990
next year and what that's going to mean

720
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,030
in terms of people that have you know a

721
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,550
bounty issued on their head and the

722
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,810
dramatic change that we're gonna be

723
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,460
implementing that's going to again it

724
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,600
just kind of goes back to what I was

725
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,400
saying earlier to where it's going to

726
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,610
become considerably more difficult to be

727
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,190
you know a wanted felon and to try to

728
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,290
operate within these secure zones where

729
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,330
you tend to get you know the best most

730
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,160
efficient you know prices and stuff to

731
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,450
where you really do want to hang out

732
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,850
there a lot of the time it's gonna be

733
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,380
it's gonna become a lot more difficult

734
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,720
and so since you're in sort of a little

735
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,150
bit of the insurance department or at

736
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,370
least you're overseeing some of those

737
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,710
design decisions are you really paying

738
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,260
attention to griefing because I'm really

739
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,570
worried that you know the experience is

740
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,580
going to be ruined because it's so Wild

741
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,170
West that you know people will just be

742
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,000
constantly doing these types of things

743
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,340
what have you guys implemented besides

744
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,020
insurance that may alleviate some of

745
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,160
that you talked a little bit about

746
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,650
anti-theft systems yeah what is that you

747
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,880
walk in the ship you touch the controls

748
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,580
it blows up well you're right it is it

749
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,530
is Wild West but that's basically just

750
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,140
you know indicative of the way that

751
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,340
we're trying to roll the stuff out as

752
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,450
soon as we have it and then we basically

753
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,070
iterate and add all these other layers

754
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,170
and so what you have right now is you

755
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,110
can basically spawn your ship I can fly

756
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,210
off somebody can right now very easily

757
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,400
steal it I can very easily get you know

758
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
a get a replacement that ease of

759
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,810
replacement is going to persist but the

760
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,490
pressure exerted on the people that are

761
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,590
stealing things and I mean that's not

762
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,540
just in terms of bounty hunters will be

763
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,160
more gone to them they will not be able

764
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,630
to get that surf you know that that

765
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,340
ships service you know within you know

766
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,930
within secured areas they're gonna pay

767
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,960
higher prices to maintain it there will

768
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,310
be ant

769
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,840
theft devices that they'll have to

770
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,550
overcome before they can actually take

771
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,770
you know the ship in the first place all

772
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,340
of these things again referring back to

773
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,710
the to the talk I gave earlier directed

774
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,850
bounty hunters where even when they're

775
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,490
within a criminal area outside the

776
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,440
jurisdiction of the you know secure zone

777
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,630
etc if the price on their head gets

778
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,340
significant enough and it would if they

779
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,110
actually stole a really expensive ship

780
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,600
then the game would actually be sending

781
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,610
you know NB c-- bounty hunters you know

782
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,710
out towards the area in addition to

783
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,500
player bounty and one thing i notice and

784
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,000
this is what some doe were brought up

785
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
while we were watching the stream what

786
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,030
happens when you get stranded ship

787
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,230
you're out in the middle of a planet

788
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,180
like a middle of nowhere and you're

789
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,620
maybe legs are broken because remember

790
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,420
he missed the several times to get there

791
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,280
it's like how do you then get back is

792
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,040
there a fast travel where you go back to

793
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,810
that's that's the entire purpose of the

794
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,340
service beacon which is it allows

795
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,940
players to request or offer their

796
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,910
services to others and npcs can do this

797
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,620
as well and so if you found yourself

798
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,660
stranded on you know on on a moon or on

799
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,610
a planet then you wind up going to your

800
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,930
mobile glass you fire up your service

801
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,240
beacon app you basically you know offer

802
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,820
100 you ec 200 you ec for transport back

803
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,590
to the you know the destination of your

804
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,080
choice and at that point players you

805
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,330
know will make the determination as to

806
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,310
whether or not that's sufficient and if

807
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,840
you have zero credits do you just throw

808
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,160
a grenade where you're at or something

809
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,570
what we'd likely wind up eventually

810
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,060
having would just be you know rescue

811
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,100
services things of that sort

812
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,960
now it may take five or eight or ten or

813
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,820
twelve minutes to actually get those out

814
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,280
to you but again depending what zone and

815
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,390
everything you're having just like in

816
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,100
the real world what happens if man walk

817
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,930
out on the street and you know and you

818
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,310
collapse it's like even if you don't

819
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,810
have interests you know someone will

820
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,310
come they will pick you up they will

821
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,410
take you to a hospital you they will you

822
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,330
will get some basic level of service

823
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,640
okay and one final thing that to sort of

824
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,980
tie in to this is are you guys concerned

825
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,380
because the my main concern I'm excited

826
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,150
it seems like that that system is a

827
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,410
little more fleshed out than the first

828
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,880
impression that I got so I'm glad to

829
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,440
hear some of this stuff from you but I'm

830
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,150
still a little concerned if I walk into

831
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,890
this game and I tell hey everybody in

832
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,480
the English oh this great game go play

833
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,250
it and they play and they realize well

834
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,250
when we come in here we are getting

835
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,040
curb-stomped by people who have spent

836
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,680
thousands of dollars you know it feels

837
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,510
paid to win in that sense where people

838
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,460
already have a massive advantage over

839
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,530
you they bought lifetime insurance they

840
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,420
bought plots of land they bought bunch

841
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,520
of ships and I'm coming in here just a

842
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,800
normal player is that a concern for you

843
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,560
guys is that something that you've you

844
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,330
know done research on and how are you

845
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,830
gonna how is that gonna work

846
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,270
I'm I'm not that concerned about it

847
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,340
because it's not a zero-sum game the

848
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,680
fact that I may have an aircraft carrier

849
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,350
and you you know and you may have you

850
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,460
know you know ship it's like well we're

851
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,530
probably gonna be pursuing different

852
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,930
objectives within the game if I'm a

853
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,700
miner and you're a bounty hunter we're

854
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,920
probably never gonna cross paths if I'm

855
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,350
basically a pirate and you know and you

856
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,960
engage in the occupation of discovery we

857
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,180
may very well never cross paths and so

858
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,040
there could be criminal organizations

859
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,510
like some of the people that came up to

860
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,190
me there's like here's what we can do

861
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,920
for you John there check this out you

862
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,480
know the Transco thing where they're

863
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,950
gonna just grief players and they're

864
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,420
gonna go to the starting area in there

865
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,520
that's their whole objective well but

866
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,320
that's but that's the basic reason why

867
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,360
there's such an emphasis on the whole

868
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,400
supply and demand economics which is is

869
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,530
if there is a lot of criminal activity

870
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,960
within a given area then you should

871
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,630
naturally see a desire to basically

872
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,030
inject more security forces in that area

873
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,770
the prices should go up as the prices

874
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,950
rise more players more NPCs would be

875
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,140
willing to take those offers and instead

876
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,400
of mining I can now make more money

877
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,140
doing security so now I'm gonna do that

878
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,760
I'm gonna hang out in this area and so

879
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,270
it's a whole yeah it's all very systemic

880
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,250
in terms of an imbalance that's

881
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,800
temporarily created by player influences

882
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,420
can basically be push back can be

883
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,190
resisted by other factors within the

884
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,900
system to bring it back down into

885
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,310
something that's you know a little bit

886
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,480
more region and that has this been

887
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,610
wrested is this just all on paper and

888
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,560
then you know and say it doesn't work

889
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,060
out the way you guys want you always

890
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,370
react to community feedback and noise

891
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,110
you always react and they're there there

892
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,080
are pieces in I thought I talked about

893
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,390
you know a lot of this in my previous

894
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,980
chat and everything you'll see a lot

895
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,750
more

896
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,880
you know the next you know 12 12 months

897
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,370
or so okay there's a lot of foundational

898
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,260
elements in some particular cases

899
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,590
there's actually significant amounts of

900
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,390
the technology but we're missing one key

901
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,500
piece one of the things I talked about

902
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,970
with the dynamic mission service which

903
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,640
is incredibly important to addressing

904
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,260
some of the specific problems that

905
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,840
you're bringing up right now but that's

906
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,700
slated for some time you know first half

907
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,830
next year okay thank you so much for

908
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,300
answering that question with me the

909
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,520
insurance guy no the director of the

910
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,320
persistent universe you're the one

911
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,790
that's probably gonna have to deal with

912
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,350
like you know the ebb and flow of

913
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,990
criminal activity and and all that stuff

914
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,280
so thank you so much for taking the time

915
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,030
to speak with us

916
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,040
