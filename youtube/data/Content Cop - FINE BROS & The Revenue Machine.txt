22
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,270

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,149
seen Luke's pussy lips before but if I

31
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,880
had I think those would resemble them

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,209
quite nicely I mean if I put a

33
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,489
pixelation over this dudes eyes you

34
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,100
wouldn't know if their pussy lips or his

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,910
eyes don't get me started on the other

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,549
one look at his glasses what did you

37
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:25,620
place at dupes would you start slipping

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,560
the revenue pros already you're hurting

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,510
my brain there are a lot of Internet

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,880
users out there saying very generic

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,380
statements like the finebros dun goofed

42
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,000
fucking hilarious I think it goes a

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,790
little bit deeper than the finebros dun

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,209
goofed they duped it up again the fine

45
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,670
cunts were looking to protect the only

46
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,459
thing that they have their format any of

47
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,200
these people that they feature on their

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,810
kids react teens react youtubers react

49
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,430
they could leave at any point in time

50
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,010
and the fine brothers would be up a

51
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,420
fucking creek without a paddle because

52
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,540
no one logs on to the fine network to

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,670
see Rafi and Benny fucked

54
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,370
I do reactions what you guys need to

55
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,560
understand is that they cannot function

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,080
without a format because they are the

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,940
corpses of YouTube what are they going

58
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,440
to do for their videos if they don't

59
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,180
have other people coming in to film

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,540
they're gonna do it themselves fuck no

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,340
corpses don't do well in YouTube videos

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,319
that's why they feel so threatened when

63
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,420
Ellen comes in this woman with a

64
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,870
personality and jokes she comes in and

65
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,330
does the same gag that the finebros do

66
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,849
but she actually has an additional

67
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,040
element to it not just random people of

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,569
the finebros fine on the street and go

69
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,130
hey buddy you want to earn a couple

70
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,560
bucks Jimmy Kimmel just talks to some

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,940
kids and they're like what do we do

72
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,830
Benny I don't know we're off e I don't

73
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,220
know

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,380
should we copyright them I don't know if

75
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,670
we could copyright them we could

76
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,590
trademark some part of why we believe

77
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,510
this initiative is important is due to

78
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,549
witnessing many creators ourselves

79
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,799
included having their shows and formats

80
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
blatantly stolen by companies and people

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,220
when you notice someone ripping

82
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,530
someone's format off don't stand for it

83
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,930
that incredible format where you bring

84
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,000
people in who have opinions and also

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,489
don't have opinions sit him in a chair

86
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,170
and say so do you know a band that was

87
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,030

88
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,799

pretty good right thankfully I have a

91
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,910
persona tied to my videos so if anyone

92

128
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,850
most interesting thing to come out of

129
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,130
this fine fiasco are the channels and

130
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,170
videos that are now dedicated to

131
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,170
counting down the death of a channel

136
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,620
seems like people are getting pretty

137
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,700
excited about it

138
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,310
today the finebros issued what I think

139
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,080
is a final statement saying that they're

140
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,150
getting rid of react world and they're

141
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,340
also going to retract their trademark

142
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,650
application for the word react and what

143
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,000
I thought would be really cool is if I

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,550
applied for the react trademark because

145
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,670
it's up for grabs now so I put my

146
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,650
application in hopefully in a couple

147
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,560
years I will fully own all the reaction

148
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,590
channels this video is sponsored by

149
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,570

150
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,160

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,740
