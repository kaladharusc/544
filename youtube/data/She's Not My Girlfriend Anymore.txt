00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,730
it's 1 p.m. on a saturday morning grocery store

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,730

4

now we're shopping so he can get any code

5
00:00:48,590 --> 00:01:02,840
today is kind of a special presentation on the vlog

6
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,729
all right i made this movie like three years ago and I just thought like

7
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,830
there's so much more to this movie

8
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,000
I should talk about it the movie is called my girlfriend Candace and I made

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,729
it way before Candice and I were married

10
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,390
it's here if you haven't seen yet this blog might not make sense if you don't

11
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,340
watch this first

12
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,430
what are you doing

13
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,430
I don't let it go

14
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,280
this is this is Candis if you don't know Candis she's my wife

15
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,690
canvas is currently reading the mail time packages that people have sent me

16
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,410
I open them are they stay here for a long time

17
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,340
well i try to open them it's just there's kind of overwhelming what have

18
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,149
you found

19
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,649
who look at this package the turkey

20
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,399
have a look at the drawing that is awesome

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,890
thank you in a day we waiting for this all come this is in here can't wait to

22
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,640
figure out now

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,360
yes I figure it out with it ok put your iphone in the blue one and then with

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,630
your iPhone's in the blue and you tried to blow into the purple one and it does

25
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,620
some it's a bad writing

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,069
what is the point maybe you need an extra battery but you don't want to

27
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,720
always have a fat case

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,400
damn ok this product is called in in fin case

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,959
thank you and Finn case for some media is there anything else that you want to

30
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,239
open but before we can start today's program

31
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,930
where's that thing that somebody saying

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,909
that like the x-ray vision goggles so you can look into all the boxes without

33
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,129
I don't have actually what do you think of that movie through your five years

34
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,269
three years later

35
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,269
well I remember the phone call in Paris

36
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,310
you have a very annoying

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,310
no I don't know

38
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,569
top

39
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,010
I don't think you're annoying horse oil and I thought it was very like an odd

40
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,019
conversation but then when I got home and I saw the note from you like my

41
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,249
heart dropped and i was like what because you know i was trying to get

42
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,120
back together with you

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,969
yeah this is this movie starts for those you who haven't seen it with us in 2005

44
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:30,099
when we went and got married

45
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,560
now this wasn't like we actually got married look we're in bathing suits and

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,980
then we got it like an old immediately thereafter

47
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,209
do you think that initial marriage was a bad idea yes

48
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,209
her parents were so upset with that

49
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:53,079
ok so this whole movie revolves around us going on an RV trip from New York to

50
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,079
Florida and close like poop

51
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:05,530
like my toilets to be stationary roughing it is not something can't you

52
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:13,780
see you're good at or enjoys it smells like you can I feel like we fought like

53
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,360
we didn't talk for a few days after the trip

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,060
we fought on the trip I know but I feel like after it was like I don't know if I

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,740
can hang out with this guy anymore

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,790
there's no sure way to find out whether you like someone or hate them and then

57
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,350
to travel with it

58
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,830
let me that's harsh

59
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,390
let's finish the movie now

60
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,550
pre-trip interview I'm excited as excited as could be

61
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,660
maybe you don't know this have literally never address this but I had braces like

62
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,570
until that a year ago in this movie was shot right before I got those braces and

63
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,830
look at the crookedness of these key like a hillbilly

64
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,730
they're getting crooked again next year are your retainer

65
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,450
I need to wear my retainer ok back we stopped at a hotel

66
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,510
maybe we're all set it really negates the whole point of having an RV if you

67
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,950
don't sleep in it

68
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,520
no yes we did make that agreement i would never have gone on it know what

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,760
thinking that we were going to sleep and drive in that thing for 36 hours

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:34,330
this scene which was shot on three ipods where it's all choreographed with us on

71
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,190
three ipods that that was shot way after the fact that that's definitely my

72
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,190
favorite scene in the whole movie

73
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,499
for a good part of our adult lives we've been stuck in this cycle

74
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,599
it's the same story you heard a million times

75
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,479
at first everything is all love you great then a little tension a pull and

76
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,900
we both walk away

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,419
we break up a little time and we forget why we were mad

78
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,780
yeah

79
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,780
with little effort we're back together

80
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,570
it breaks off it feels so real so permanent

81
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,169
but

82
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,490
time heals all

83
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,830
and again we forget

84
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,430
then

85
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,430
now here we are

86
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,390
just a little just pause a little product

87
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,790
there's no way that I could capture in any movie just how to mulch with our

88
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,330
relationship was until we got married

89
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,150
I mean in like six years we probably broke up six times at least

90
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,610
I mean like serious breakouts really seeing other people breakups and like I

91
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:18,300
had to go get a tattoo break up and like get skinny hot break up but to get me

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,140
back

93
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,250
yeah just like that that's what girls do when you pick up your scanning are you

94
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,010
just a little you know what were we talking about before I interrupted you

95
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,780
the context is something funny like it don't you think

96
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,520
like you get mad at people

97
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,190
that is the real killer

98
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,080
like that

99
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,180
I should be with somebody

100
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,180
a little

101
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,080
I can't imagine my life without you

102
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
it was a really gnarly relationship

103
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,220
the kind of relationship where your friends are like oh I don't want to ever

104
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,050
hear that name again

105
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,430
yeah and then my sisters like you will end up together my moms like just leave

106
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,860
him alone and Marcie's like I can't deal with you anymore and then everything

107
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,550
worked out now we have like the most perfect happiness me courage ever

108
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,879
because we literally almost broke up yesterday

109
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,879
yeah and every day

110
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,249
yeah

111
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,630
yeah

112
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,110
you want to not fight on a trip like this

113
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,410
I never want to fight ever but there was a lot left ignored

114
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:54,540
we've been broken up for a while plus we haven't slept much and I've done a

115
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,660
terrible job planning and canvas it better putting its board about we shot

116
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,140
that movie in 2011 I didn't put that online and told 2013

117
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,800
the reason why is I knew the minute I put online that I was gonna have to

118
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,540
propose to you and then marry you

119
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,650
but why do you think that well because i think that like by brew leasing that

120
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,610
putting that in the public there's a level of accountability there and if i

121
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,220
were to make a movie like that about you and show the world that means I couldn't

122
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,400
date anyone else has just say that the things you wouldn't be able to date

123
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,160
anyone else no way

124
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
yeah

125
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,990
yeah

126
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,690
yeah

127
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,010
yeah

128
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,000
all right I think that's it i hope you enjoyed this behind the seat

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,730
Candace brought an entire bag of cookies for this little like screening project

130
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,980
and she's really doing a hell of a job

131
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,850
why would you open the bag like that it's easier to get to them

132
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,220
this that that is why this marriage death

133
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,550
that is why this marriage you know i will open up the box of Lucky Charms

134
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,800
gesture and you opened it from the bottom

135
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,810
how do you how is this they're supposed to work if that's the kind of behavior i

136
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,830
have to deal with

137
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,040
she toured the cookie back open from the side

138
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,550
who does that

139
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:53,910
yeah

140
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,910
hi did you apply this dog is 14 years old so we should put on the blog more

141
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,130
because she's a senior citizen
