1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,149
Sup you beautiful bastards. Hope you're having a fantastic Monday

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,299
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,240
And the first thing we're gonna talk about today is we actually have a special guest host today. Ah

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,330
His name is cara de Franco. He's a little young. He's a little green got some interesting thoughts

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,859
They're not fantastically pronounced thoughts or you could argue. They're not even fully words

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,109
I dig the vibe is its own good you were just so confused. You just see yourself. It isn't gonna work out. I'm sorry

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,250
You can go that way your services are needed. Oh, no

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,360
All right, I think I got a better better replacement host you ready Wow

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,550
Okay, the first thing we're gonna talk about today is what the VA? Yeah, what happened with the VA?

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,010
Well, okay. Well you just that's half the job really?

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,050
Bye thanks for trying. Well, that was a failed experiment. I guess you and I are still stuck together

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,590
But with that said the actual first thing I do want to talk about today is with yesterday

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,969
Having been Veterans Day in the United States on top of just saying thank you to the men and women who have served and sacrificed

14
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:03,000
For this country. I also think it's important to talk about how as a country. We fail our veterans

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,189
Well, there are many different things we could talk about here

16
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,780
what we're gonna be talking about today is something more recent and

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,250
Affecting the immediate lives of veterans now and to start things off with a story

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,409
We briefly need to look back to 1944

19
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,259
and the reason for that is to mention that the US government has provided benefits to veterans since

20
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:23,040
1944 when the first so-called GI Bill of Rights was passed at that time veterans returning from World War two were eligible for a number

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
Of benefits things like better mortgage rates

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,350
tuitions a poor

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,740
business loan and it's largely been considered a huge success in the GI Bill of Rights has been updated over the years to reflect the

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,630
country and what veterans need with the latest version of the GI Bill of Rights the forever GI Bill passing unanimously into law in

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,619
2017 but a small part of that bill has resulted in big problems for veterans receiving their benefits and by that I mean many are

26
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,399
Not the gist of this. Is that while the forever GI Bill expanded veteran's benefits

27
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,610
the Department of Veterans Affairs as technical capabilities didn't expand to keep up and so the result has been

28
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,579
thousands of veterans as educational or housing stipends being delayed or just simply not delivered and so with this

29
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,950
Of course, you have the question. Okay. Well, where is the problem?

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,070
well

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,110
the Veterans Affairs Office of Information and Technology was given the

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,320
Responsibility of calculating the housing allowance and the new GI Bill required the stipend to be based on the zip code where the veteran goes

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,550
To school not where they live that was supposed to to effect on August first

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,910
But instead there were huge problems and according to VA spokesman Terrence Hays

35
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,450
There were severe critical errors during testing that resulted in incorrect payments

36
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,709
So the VA decided to postpone employment of the system and pay student veterans under 2017 rates

37
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,400
Which also meant that they were ignoring a 1% increase in payments for 2018 reportedly?

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,810
They plan to reimburse students the difference at some point in the future and according to Patrick Murray deputy director of Veterans of Foreign Wars

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,819
After these issues with the zip code system in the VA telling schools to wait to enroll students

40
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,230
That's when the floodgates opened with all the delays trying to get the upgrades in the zip code processing

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,459
They suddenly got all their enrollments which usually come during the spring across the summer instead

42
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,230
They all came a few weeks before the fall semester and they couldn't keep up. And so the result was that by November 8th reportedly

43
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,530
82,000 veterans were waiting for housing payment and it really doesn't appear that the VA was prepared for this and to kind of give you

44
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,700
A frame of reference here at the end of August the Veterans Benefits Administration reportedly had nearly two hundred

45
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,340
39,000 pending claims that is reportedly

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,819
100,000 more claims in the same time in 2017. Now what's really crazy is according to Hayes the spokesman for the VA

47
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,500
They are unable to identify the number of veterans solely

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,959
Impacted by delayed payments until all enrollment documents are processed and it's really important understand

49
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,209
This is a massive issue that's causing problems for veterans

50
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,709
I mean you have people being evicted being kicked out of school getting unnecessary loan and credit card debt

51
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,070
If people like for example Shelley

52
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,640
Roundtree veteran who served in the Army who was studying marketing at Berkeley College in New York hasn't received benefits recently

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,920
His housing stipend wasn't delivered. He was kicked out of his apartment

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,860
He sleeping on his sister's couch, which is further away from school

55
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,400
And as if that wasn't enough after moving his belongings to a storage container reportedly

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,390
They are now in danger of being auctioned off because he can't afford a round tree telling NBC News

57
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,910
I'm about to lose everything that I own and become a homeless

58
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,170
I don't want to be that veteran on the street begging for change because I haven't received what I was promised having

59
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,489
It's just confusing who is there for us? Who is

60
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,920
Representing us who is helping us always doing what they need to do to better the situation for veterans

61
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,400
Also in October you at Jane Wylie a former Marine and current Air Force reservists saying she sent her

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,910
certification documents two months before but had no idea about her payments telling NBC

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,060
Evil are homeless and starving because they can't rely on getting their benefits if it means making VA employees stay all night

64
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,859
then get it done because it's better than putting families in crisis you can count on us to serve but we can't count on the

65
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,940
VA to make a deadline now on that note the VA has importantly been making attempts to resolve these issues

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,209
He is saying that education

67
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,970
Services has the regional processing offices and mandatory overtime to get the claims that we've also reportedly added

68
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,940
200 to temporary employees to handle these pending claims amounting to what they say is 16,000 claims process per day

69
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,180
also

70
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,520
reportedly the House Committee on Veterans Affairs is going to hold a hearing on Wednesday to

71
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,030
Investigate these issues and on this note you had Phil Roe the chair of the House Committee on Veterans

72
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,750
Affairs saying this is to be kind a train wreck

73
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,870
It's really frustrating the amount of money that Congress has appropriated for veterans

74
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,680
And this is the way VA has rolled it out this discussion started over a year ago

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,560
But also an important thing to note is even without these increases the VA might have still been

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,140
Unprepared in a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Rose said that when visiting a VA processing center

77
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,150
They found rampant technological problems reportedly employees told his staff that systems frequently froze and crash

78
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,590
so some tasks that normally took five minutes now take

79
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,090
45 employees talked about suffering blue screens of death and managers actually had to write off

80
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,930
16,000

81
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,070
890 man-hours due to system crashes or latency issues and actually before the new GI Bill passed into law a deputy undersecretary for Economic Opportunity

82
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,880
Curtis coy saying in a house hearing my biggest concern is two words

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,450
ITT have an IT system in much or almost all of these sections that requires some degree of changes. But quo

84
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,780
I actually retired this year and the VA cut his position and the Office of Economic Opportunity

85
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,850
where he worked which many VA service organization says cuts all veterans from communicating with the

86
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,540
Organization and removes their ability to lobby higher-ups about GI bill issues and actually on that point according to VA numbers

87
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,510
there are more than

88
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,300
45,000 vacancies at the VA and the department hasn't had a permanent CIO since the previous one departed with the outgoing Obama

89
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,960
Administration but with all of that said ultimately that is where we are right now

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,150
It will be interesting to see what comes out of this hearing this week if there is any sort of movement or progress

91
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,030
I think really the main point here is this is something that we need to focus on

92
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,760
we need to address as a country if we can't make sure that we are looking after and providing for those that looked after our

93
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,430
country provided themselves to this country

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,620
I think that says a lot about us and while I get hopeful when I see things like a

95
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,720
2017 report from HUD noting that since 2010 homeless veterans have dropped by 45 percent

96
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,320
I also get concerned because even before this issue that report says from 2016 to 2017

97
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,780
There was an increase it was small is by 1.5 percent, but when we talk about that

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,780
There is no new CIO when we talk about the problems now

99
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,120
I get very concerned and so with this story because I don't think a valid question is do you think we should be taking care?

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
Of the veteran instead. The question I have today is a little more targeted

101
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,289
If you are a veteran you have a veteran in your family

102
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,810
What is your experience been with the VA whether it be fantastic experiences horrific horrible experiences?

103
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,050
Maybe something more in the middle frustrating things like that

104
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,069
Let me know any and all because I think it's just important that we talk about these things from that

105
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:53,319
I want to share some stuff I loved today and today in awesome brought to you by post mates and post mates if you don't

114
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,080
We decided to do a special video for veterans day. I don't want to ruin what it's about

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,849
But if you want to check it out after today's show

116
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,389
I highly recommend it and then I have no idea what this is going to look like

117
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,810
We got a first trailer of Pokemon detective Pikachu Pikachu

118
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:41,500
Of course is voiced by Ryan Reynolds and dude this looks it looks amazing and weird and I'm on board also

119
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,779
We got a teaser for Toy Story 4 a trailer for Mystery Science Theater

120
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,889
3000 the gauntlet intended giving us history versus Henry the eighth

121
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:53,469
We have a new Lucas the spider with Michael B Jordan going undercover on Twitter YouTube and reddit if you want to see the full

122
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,349
Versions of everything I just shared the secret link of the day really anything at all

123
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,089
Links is always our in the description down below

124
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,940
Let's talk about these horrible fires in California, and they're actually three they're gonna talk about in Southern, California

125
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,860
you have the Woolsey fire in the Hill Fire which together our force the

126
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,940
evacuations of around a quarter million people in Ventura in LA counties

127
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,120
The hill fire is the smallest of the three as of this morning it had burned

128
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,419
4531 acres and was eighty percent contained

129
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:16,810
meanwhile

130
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,909
The Woolsey fire has burned over ninety one thousand acres and is only around 20% contained that fires destroyed an estimated

131
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:25,879
370 structures and fire officials actually say another

132
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,300
57,000 are threatened. Also the Woolsey fire has killed at least two people with three others injured and according to reports

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,890
It's been making this fire difficult to tackle as you have these strong

134
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,349
Santana winds that have been Fanning the flame authorities warn that these gusts will continue through Tuesday

135
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,180
But the worst of the damage that we're seeing is happening in northern

136
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,130
Alif or nia where you have the campfire a fire that has covered nearly the entire town of Paradise, California

137
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,630
Which is home to more than 26,000 people and it's already considered the most destructive fire in California's history

138
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:59,490
It's scorched through 113 thousand acres. It's only 25 percent contained. It's also destroyed more than 6,700 structures

139
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,180
15,000 more

140
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,240
Threatened so far the fires taken at least 29 live which actually also makes it one of the deadliest fires ever happen in California

141
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,490
Has the same number of deaths as the 1933 Griffith Park fire, but right now there are over 200 people reportedly still missing

142
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,600
Which means that the number could rise soon. Well this situation has gained national and international attention

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,100
I think largely due to just how

144
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,520
horrifying so much of the footage coming out is also appears to have gotten a lot more attention due to some of the people that

145
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,320
Have been affected by this fire as well as some notable

146
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,240
responses 15 tons of celebrities posting on social media about their homes being in the path of a fire, right the likes of the

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,270
Kardashians Orlando Bloom Lady Gaga's from the digital world people like Shane Dawson, Jeffrey star

148
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,810
It's not just people saying they had to evacuate

149
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,130
But several people have actually lost their homes and the thing I really appreciated from these latter posts are people like Gerard Butler and Miley

150
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,830
Cyrus what we saw them do is they were using this opportunity to say. Hey you look at me

151
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,260
Look, this is what happened to me

152
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,060
But it also happened to so many other people and so you saw people like Gerard Butler promoting to support

153
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,070
LAFD bad or a place where you can support the Los Angeles Fire Department?

154
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,770
I also love that Jeffrey star in addition to raising awareness saying, you know these places they need donations went and donated himself

155
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:13,010
I appreciated Miley Cyrus promoting to several organizations where people could donate and so before moving on to where this story goes

156
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,910
I do want to take the opportunity to take advantage

157
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,360
of the celebrity that is involved with this story and use it as a way to promote good if you do want to help I'm

158
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,480
gonna link down below to a ton of fantastic organizations

159
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,709
Additionally GoFundMe has organized a page where you can donate to families that have lost their homes

160
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,500
usually you have

161
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,870
Airbnb launching a program where until November

162
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,720
29th people can open up their homes for people who've been displaced or aid workers where they can stay for free

163
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,750
so I'm gonna provide all event down below if you can and you want to help now with that said that opportunity taken advantage of

164
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,300
The other reason that people knew about this fire was because of the president's response on Saturday. We saw presidents from tweets

165
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,640
There is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California

166
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,100
Except that forest management is so poor millions

167
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:00,000
Dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forest remedy now or no more Fed payments

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,330
And while we saw responses from people in the celebrity world, like leonardo dicaprio katy perry also responses in the political world by california

169
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,060
Governor elect gavin newsom along with congressman ted Lieu. I instead just wanted to highlight the response from brian que rice

170
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,350
Ryan, is the president of the California Professional Firefighters?

171
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:21,570
Any criticized Trump's remarks in a statement saying the president's message attack in California in threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic

172
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,080
Fires is ill-informed

173
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,570
ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines the president's assertion the

174
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:36,030
California's forest management policies are to blame for catastrophic wildfire is dangerously wrong wildfires are sparked and spread not only in forested areas

175
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,960
but in populated areas and open fields fueled by parched vegetation high winds low humidity and

176
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,770
Geography moreover nearly 60% of California forests are under federal management and another one-third under private control

177
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,640
It is the federal government that has chosen to divert resources away from forest management

178
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,280
Not California and while over the weekend and into Monday

179
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,600
We saw the president's still talking about this situation saying our hearts are with those fighting the fires

180
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
God bless them all reading

181
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,720
Please listen to evacuation orders from state and local officials

182
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,370
California firefighters FEMA and first responders are amazing and very brave still on Sunday hit on the note of forest management tweeting with proper forest

183
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,910
Management we can stop the devastation

184
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,110
Constantly going on in, California

185
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,870
Yet smart once again that comment in the face of comments like that from Brian Kay rice

186
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,500
Also on Sunday saw Governor Jerry Brown holding a press conference where he thanked, the firefighters and first responders

187
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,300
But also he warned that based on climate conditions. This was likely not to be the last fire

188
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
This is not the new normal

189
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,750
This is the new abnormal and this new abnormal will continue

190
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,440
certainly in the next 10 to 15 to 20 years and

191
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,190
Unfortunately, the best science is telling us that

192
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,420
dryness

193
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,870
warmth droughts all those things

194
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,660
They're gonna intensify without saying Trump's name you responded to the criticism of forest management saying this

195
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:57,640
Scientists and the engineers and the firefighters all tell us forest management is one element. It's only one and

196
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,940
We have to take care of the whole range of

197
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,850
Threats and conditions and actions that are part of our living with fire

198
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,350
Living with fire threats mainly do all the force in everywhere

199
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:17,710
We can does not stop climate change and those who deny that are definitely

200
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,570
Contributing to the tragedies that were now witnessing and will continue to witness

201
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,600
In the coming years and according to Browns office. He has requested a major disaster declaration from President Trump

202
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,040
And as of right now that is where we are with this story and if there is kind of a final note that I can

203
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,050
Hit on again. There are tons of different ways to help

204
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,380
There are a lot of organizations that are trying to provide for a lot of different things

205
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,850
Obviously when it comes to donations, I highly encourage people to do research on those organizations

206
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,020
But that's also why I'm going to include a list down below and that was going to be where we ended today's show

207
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,800
But I did want to add this little bit just because right at the ends of today's show

208
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,610
We got the horrible news that Stan Lee has passed away at the age of 95

209
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,340
there is a lot to be said about the man his body of work and

210
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,380
many stories around but if there is something I can say that goes beyond Thank You Stan Lee for

211
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,940
Providing the stories that so many of us grew up on I think it's important to hit on a note that we see

212
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:13,020
with Stan Lee and that is we are more than what we are we are and we live past this body with what we put

213
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,830
Out into the world we do so to varying degrees

214
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,940
Some of us are privileged enough to be able to reach a large number of people and hopefully we do good with that every single

215
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,300
person can do that to some degree starting with friends and family whether through the

216
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,800
stories

217
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,910
We tell the words we say or the actions we take and I think that's an important thing for us to take into everyday onna

218
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,300
maybe there's something there or maybe that's just the the word vomit as I am still processing it all but with that said that is

219
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,920
Where I'm going to now end today's show with that said remember if you like today's show you like what I try and do with
