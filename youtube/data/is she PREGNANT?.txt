1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
then your is that the box it came in in it

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,270

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Jack's meeting me in there to help me shoot something that should be fine

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,380
I really love how empty the city is at this hour this guy requires a certain

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,460
lighting environment which is why i wanted to do it so early in the morning

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,880
okay learning morning so i'll wake you up so early

11
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,390
sorry all right let's go outside and try to figure out

12
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,970

13
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,159

14
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:39,110

15
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,720
that we're doing what we had to fly the drone down and then into this office is

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,190
finally got her

17
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,750

18
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,320
so I gotta go to the airport tonight and when I was buying my ticket yesterday I

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,590
was like what it what airline should i book with and I well with jetblue COS of

20
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,600
all my airline experimentation jetblue's the only jetblue's the only airline that

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,190
follow the Golden Rule and that is to treat others the way you want to be

22
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,660
treated other airlines follow this other rule that i would describe as treat your

23
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,950
customers the way you would treat an angry herd of cattle right anyway I

24
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,950
booked on jetblue I like jetblue and then today

25
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:31,820
this anonymous looking somewhat creepy care package shows up and guess what's

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,230
in it

27
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,379
all kinds of jetblue swag

28
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,330
there's a letter I don't know the letter went but so thank you jetblue please

29
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,099
know that i bought the ticket before you set me all this stuff that i'm not sure

30
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,030
what I'm going to do it

31
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,030
ah that bought the ticket because your people are nice

32
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,590
not because you set me free gloves and a headband but thank you for the free

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,310

35
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,060

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,990

43
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,830
of her new jewelry for her new line and then important people come by and look

44
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,519
at it

45
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,819

major tripping hazard that

48
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,169
that would have been ugly

49
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,620
