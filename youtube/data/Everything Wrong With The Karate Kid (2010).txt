1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,250
37 seconds of logos followed by 20

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,929
seconds of slowly reading a growth chart

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,370
this movie has no right to take up 2

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,839
hours and 20 minutes of your life so

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,190
it's signaling early that it couldn't

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,720
give a flying around house to the face

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,670
about your time just get used to it so

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,800
he lost his first tooth on December 11th

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
2002 but somehow grew a full goddamn

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,250
image in the three weeks prior to

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,410
January 1st 2003 I know kids especially

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,019
boys grow fast but not that fast

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,059
oh Jesus here's 2.5 inches of growth

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,739
between April Oh three in May oh three

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,000
and my point is this movie thinks male

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,770
human boys grow roughly a centimeter an

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,930
hour and that is whack Jesus Christ

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,760
movie have you handed much literally

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,350
sixty two seconds into the film and

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,190
you're doing this daddy died

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,020
heartstrings bull also what kind of

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,280
parent makes their kids stand for a

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,690
measurement to commemorate the death of

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,190
their father sorry honey I know it's

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,539
been a rough day look you know the house

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,980
rules now go stand against the door so

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,600
we can submit in your growing psyche

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,190
your father's tragic demise unless you

29
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,600
think it was Trey himself who wrote this

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,340
in which case here's another sin for

31
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,600
thinking a grieving child doing this

32
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,699
makes any more sense okay what's worse

33
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,530
that he didn't post anything since daddy

34
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,210
died but now suddenly posts moving to

35
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,979
China the fact that I treated his growth

36
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,630
wall like a Twitter feed by calling

37
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,250
these posts or the fact that he wrote

38
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,260
this in pencil or that he capitalized

39
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,700
move but not China that's the back story

40
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,320
here did that board once belong to Dre

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,820
but this rain-soaked buddy wanted off

42
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,380
him on a technicality after betting on

43
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,610
something stupid like whether or not the

44
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,110
word China is supposed to be capitalized

45
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,280
and then the board became a point of

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
contention between them from that day on

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,130
Jaden their friendship until this day

48
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,570
when the friend realized his friendship

49
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,560
was more important than any old

50
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,909
skateboard so he decided to make a grand

51
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,500
gesture of platonic love by gifting the

52
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,450
board back to Dre cuz I'd rather watch

53
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,520
that movie than a Karate Kid remake also

54
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,110
that board is impact or anything so

55
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,369
unless he carries it on the plane with

56
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,630
him which I think they would stop him

57
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,009
from doing that board is getting broke

58
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,780
in half at 15,000 feet when the luggage

59
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,759
shifts god damn this is some Bucky Steve

60
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,180
Rogers levels brands and now we know why

61
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,799
he's moving to China because they funded

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,630
this movie dude from Detroit Detroit is

63
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,340
not a real place also I actually speak

64
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,950
the same language you do cliche

65
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,910
a John Mayer song about honesty and

66
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,410
deception and relationships it's the

67
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,150
perfect song for this scene because that

68
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,830
has no bearing on anything going on or

69
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,750
our characters also couldn't you have

70
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,430
opened here song movie title and credits

71
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,110
obviously not Chinese mother and son

72
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,940
flying to obviously China do we need the

73
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,560
last five minutes for any story reason

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,930
Oh bubble wrap his skateboard and that

75
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,640
somehow kept it from breaking United

76
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,290
breaks guitars but air china treats

77
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,370
skateboards like priceless heirlooms and

78
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,019
that's the story of how Adeline Packer

79
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,010
ended up stranded at the airport

80
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,049
wondering why her ride never showed she

81
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,190
was then forced to turn to a life of

82
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,690
servitude at late-night mahjong

83
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,160
tournaments turning tiles for enough

84
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
money to scrape by in a hellhole she

85
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,370
would never escape poor Adeline Packer

86
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,440
there's no nap but doesn't like show

87
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,690
depth but to some know depth is my knoll

88
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,239
[Music]

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,260
she gets out of the car what I'm

90
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,880
guessing is her new home I can't help

91
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,260
but point out that we've heard nearly

92
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,549
three-fourths of this freaking John

93
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,500
Mayer song in its entirety for the new

94
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,780
dude in 305 I'm Harry convenient aid

95
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,610
similar American is convenient look at

96
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,069
you making friends already with the kid

97
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,150
that speaks English and it's clearly

98
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,889
American good for you son you're really

99
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,030
starting to embrace this whole moved I

100
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,109
trying to think what kids I'm trying to

101
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,519
really need there Robert the sponsor

102
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,200
where's the quadrilateral trousers both

103
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,150
dubbed and subtitle hilarious kids speak

104
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,370
but I actually have set up lag we're ten

105
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,690
minutes into this Karate Kid movie and

106
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,250
I've gotten tons of kid and not even one

107
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,590
fucking whiff of karate school tonight

108
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,900
you moved to China for your new job but

109
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,010
you did it literally the day before

110
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,400
school starts there haha because you

111
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,750
expected the one thing but we gave you

112
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,920
the other thing hahaha

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,450
also I get that this is a joke because

114
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,889
the original Miyagi was trying to catch

115
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,480
a fly with chopsticks but if harm was

116
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,829
planted to swamp this fly why was he

117
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:58,910
chopped sticking at it to begin with

118
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,109
Jaidyn is trying to channel his dad so

119
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,519
hardcore here that i feel like by the

120
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,840
end of this movie we could solve the

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,340
whole nature versus nurture debate with

122
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,870
the comparative analysis of the two in

123
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,639
china public ping-pong tables use rocks

124
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,370
instead of nets because honestly I can't

125
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,750
even make up a reason why this would be

126
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,120
necessary or preferable or even exist is

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,229
this meant to illustrate poverty

128
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,090
ingenuity is it really easier to last

129
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,420
cast

130
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,620
a bunch of rocks over here to build a

131
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,060
wall than it is to find a few pieces of

132
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,410
string and paper he is sin I wish the

133
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,490
movie would quit trying to make me think

134
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,730
he is go talk to her scared I'm not

135
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,380
scared it's hard enough to get great

136
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,760
performances out of kids without getting

137
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,930
them dialogue that feels like it was

138
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,670
bought off the dollar menu at Taco Bell

139
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,220
to them all time their tape even this

140
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,870
kid knows who Bach is goddamnit in

141
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,490
movies all devices are at the ready to

142
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,020
immediately play the exact song you were

143
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,440
thinking in your head even if it's 2010

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,300
his spine survives this you got beat

145
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,800
twice now give up and go home

146
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,510
this is the kind of tin cup stubbornness

147
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,440
you only find in movies so this is

148
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,700
supposed to be like the beach fight in

149
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,020
the original then alright and I'm

150
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,340
supposed to be enjoying myself because

151
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,960
it reminds me of a movie I loved cool

152
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,700
just making sure remember how nostalgia

153
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,110
works since Hollywood gives me so few

154
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,430
opportunities to have it forced down my

155
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,530
throat

156
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,700
why no movies always turn the bullying

157
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,230
up to 11 is it possible we have a whole

158
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,430
generation of bullies who don't even

159
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,020
realize they're bullies because they've

160
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,310
never gone so far as to knock someone's

161
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,630
tray of hot noodles into their face

162
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,520
first she sends off Dre without lunch

163
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,320
instead of the fucking bully then the

164
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,730
bully is allowed to shoulder thump him

165
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,860
in full view of God and everyone and the

166
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,020
teacher does nothing public schools suck

167
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,430
everywhere

168
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,750
you're rushing it we have to work this

169
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,370
weekend so we can add the overworked

170
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,020
child perfection this kid to the

171
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,610
already-existing fish-out-of-water kit

172
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,440
and the over-the-top rebel bully kid if

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,670
this movie has a popular and stuck-up

174
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,590
jacket and a dark and brooding outcast

175
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:52,950
kid

176
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,630
I'm calling Breakfast Club bingo I never

177
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,580
realized how tiny China was but he keeps

178
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,380
running into these guys everywhere are

179
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,170
they cloned oh shut up and this movie is

180
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,580
a lot more beat for beat the original

181
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,960
film than I was expecting

182
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,430
creativity does not exist in this dojo

183
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,430
does it no sensei

184
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,980
tell that to your movie's title bub

185
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,200
[Music]

186
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,449
how's the peeping Jackie

187
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,370
it took all of 20 seconds for these kids

188
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,689
to go all hard day's night on the

189
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,879
Forbidden City kids while I can

190
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,379
certainly appreciate Dre's desire to

191
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,270
continue reppin Motown sports franchises

192
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,740
by the looks of the rest of his class

193
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,189
shouldn't he be in a uniform today I'm

194
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,509
surprised he's not wearing a circular

195
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:37,009
shower costume well getting even with

196
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,719
these bullies ha is going full jacket

197
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,309
Chan on these kids and for a few brief

198
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:41,809
seconds in this movie I actually want to

199
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,580
be watching this stranger danger much I

200
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,139
know Han just saved the day and all but

201
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,639
Dre getting shirtless and lying down

202
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,770
well hon let's some sort of fire suction

203
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,029
healing seems like something they might

204
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,740
have wanted to run past mamataji first

205
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,870
that's not how fire works now cue the

206
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,339
people sending me links to some weirdo

207
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,779
science youtuber putting chemically

208
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,339
engineered lemon sauce on his hands and

209
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,870
achieving a similar effect and I do not

210
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,999
care this is not healing you see when

211
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,699
you leave the ice so you easy to fool

212
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,349
what's the word for when Jackie Chan is

213
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,729
way more charming than Pat Morita in

214
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,469
reality but somehow less charming the

215
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,120
marina in a Karate Kid movie Chandon

216
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Freud deja Morita no sorry guy says he

217
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,490
won't do a thing even though everyone

218
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,719
knows he's gonna do the thing and

219
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,800
honestly this is one of the most

220
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,979
annoying ways movies build fake tension

221
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,680
meeting yo you got a tongue job you know

222
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,629
peace on earth do you sex poster why

223
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,430
would this idea satiate Chinese creases

224
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,169
bloodlust here at first I wanted to see

225
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,430
you or your student get checked up

226
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,149
before you leave

227
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,409
but now that you've mentioned a publicly

228
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,789
regulated tournament in a distant future

229
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,740
everything's totally cool oh yeah I'm a

230
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,360
skateboard I almost forgot about that

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,949
thing that was super important for a hot

232
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,129
minute back in the beginning super

233
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,139
racist also isn't it kind of weird that

234
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,580
they're practicing kung-fu in this movie

235
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,259
and not karate I guess kung-fu kid

236
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,610
doesn't quite have the ring or nostalgic

237
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,349
name recognition of Karate Kid so I

238
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,759
guess I'll go back to my petition to fix

239
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,379
the pursuit of happiness Marty McFly

240
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,909
call he's wondering if the audience is

241
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,430
supposed to be impressed by this and he

242
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,779
told me more of this uncle remain please

243
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,879
no seriously I'd rather watch a movie

244
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,349
about crazy anvil REME then sit through

245
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:10,729
the rest of this beat for beat remake of

246
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,930
a movie I already know by heart why

247
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,249
Miyagi and Han share an annoying Creek

248
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,779
they both think that they have to lie to

249
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,669
the kid to train them like by not saying

250
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:21,289
doing these motions over and over will

251
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,209
help you learn come foo Han is I guess

252
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:27,350
just come with direct what'd you learn

253
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,000
and then we cut to him back at Hans

254
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
doing the jacket again if he truly

255
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,669
thinks he's learning nothing why does he

256
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:32,990
keep going back how much strain on at

257
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,789
least constantly asking why he continues

258
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,810
to hang up the same jacket

259
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,430
heyis work are you sure every single

260
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,960
shot needs a fancy establishing movement

261
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,849
of course nobody paid for a crane on

262
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,500
that agent Cody Banks movie I did so you

263
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,729
better believe I'm gonna use it here

264
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,860
we're both kind of practicing you know

265
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,260
skip shouldn't you be wearing a mask I

266
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,880
can literally see the dust flying off

267
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,830
that car door into your mouth mr. Hall

268
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,270
would you like to go with us no thank

269
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,570
you

270
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,339
too many people mr. Han I'm not taking

271
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,380
no for an answer I'm with Hans de solo

272
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,850
here how dare you force him to go

273
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,380
somewhere he's not comfortable the man

274
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,060
said no leave us introverts alone

275
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,029
literally imagine so she cats a lighter

276
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,430
we were in the sky not really narration

277
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,290
you're reading or even exposition but

278
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,730
it's just as boring and another complete

279
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,380
waste of our time so here's an extra 10

280
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,970
sins for the Chinese paper puppetry

281
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,740
shadows storytelling they are definitely

282
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,880
blocking the light here and there

283
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,140
pinky-swear should be visible to

284
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,400
everyone watching the shadow play

285
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,750
especially since the movies gonna have

286
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,430
them kiss each other and block the light

287
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,810
in a minute and the audience will see

288
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,420
that Judy's check it on so and another

289
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,740
moment ruined because we've seen this

290
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,959
exact wax on wax off realization before

291
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,730
except this time it's jacket on jacket

292
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,440
off which now that I say out loud I can

293
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,310
only assume was written by blink 182

294
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,220
stop hanging up these moves look nothing

295
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,270
like the moves he was doing when he

296
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,010
picked up or hung up his jacket not even

297
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,360
what condoms hang up their jacket with

298
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,420
their arms crossed I mean this one's

299
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,279
just a train shot did we really shut up

300
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,529
and order the helicopter now so you have

301
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:05,150
a license and a car trained please be

302
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,600
quiet

303
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,490
this isn't dialogue this is just b-roll

304
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,900
of the two actors between takes

305
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,339
she internal energy it moves inside us

306
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,670
flows through our body aka the force man

307
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,350
Lucas really did cripple a lot of Star

308
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,350
Wars from Asian cultures I'm like I'm

309
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,839
like a Jedi only the movie thinks it can

310
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,100
just reference Star Wars and try to

311
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,750
steal my joke making thunder but movie

312
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,950
was wrong because I got there first

313
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,060
in-your-face movie you you know I've

314
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,410
seen him carrying that skateboard in

315
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,940
about six scenes in this movie he's

316
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,980
ridden it in one the journey to the top

317
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,480
of the mountain

318
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
beautiful dragon well oh you got a

319
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,959
little Kung Fu Panda in my Karate Kid

320
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,250
remake looks like a few of these guys

321
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,930
lost focus on their waterfowl production

322
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,420
chief yo guy on the far right it's when

323
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,079
Guardium Leviosa god

324
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,860
there better be a been awesome water

325
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,130

326
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,720

327
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,279

329
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,260
wrong

330
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,940
fun fact producers had to pay John

331
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,250
Claude 3.7 million dollars to use this

332
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,870
shot because he has this damn move

333
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,519
trademark this better be the tastiest

334
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,529
water of all time man because I feel

335
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:13,670
like you could have fully trained him in

336
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,529
all of kung fu with the effort you both

337
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,240
used climbing up this bitch let me guess

338
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,920
this Cobra sky move is yet another

339
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,449
paint-by-numbers replacement of the

340
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:21,920
crane kick from the original what's the

341
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
point of doing a new movie if you're

342
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,910
just swapping out pieces you drink and

343
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,709
nothing can defeat you this is exactly

344
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,480
what I say to myself every time I open

345
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,010
another bottle of wine also let's think

346
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,940
about what's required to have a

347
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,560
functioning fountain up here we are at

348
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
the very top of a hugely tall mountain

349
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,709
and that fountain is constantly bubbling

350
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,180
up from below against the laws of

351
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,690
physics

352
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,250
meaning the dragon fountain is powered

353
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,870
by electricity or some kind of motor

354
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,399
making it way more modern than its

355

358
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,100
do you have to teach this at the edge of

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,899
a high-rise roof though because I don't

364
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,029
needs to be this obsessed with muscles

365
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,829
or their power poses not sure any

366
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:05,329
twelve-year-old should even have apps

367
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,880
like that feels genetically enhanced and

368
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,620
wrong I know I'm wrong but it kind of

369
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,029
looks like her violin case has wheels

370
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,529
and I'm suddenly picturing a premium

371
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,240
rush style story detour where he

372
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,980
skateboards and she uses her violin case

373
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,449
as a skateboard and they roll around

374
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:19,430
town stopping evil flash mobs I'd give

375
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,839
good money at this violin case weren't

376
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,339
waterproof and later she got to her

377
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,690
audition and pulled out a soggy Oz

378
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,819
violin warped from water damage would be

379
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:26,899
hilarious comeuppance for this

prestigious music school ever gave her

the wrong audition date until literally

20 minutes away from the real date and

387
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,269
time it's the screenwriters fault

like doing the Gettysburg Address at

your intro to public speaking class of

me anxious but instead he goes to Hans

house and thank God because Hahn is

suddenly drunk and destroying the car

he's long been restoring which leads to

400
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,949
you guessed it another scene straight

401
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,170
out of the original film it was a steep

402
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,379
hill awesome green car yes stop crying

403
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:10,420
and get to the tournament how did you

404
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,920
bribe enough studio execs to release a

405
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,930
two-hour 20 minute cut of this film that

406
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,399
alone is more magical than anything you

407
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,259
shot are we seriously doing another

training montage for three full minutes

409
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,259
this movie should have been over ten

410
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,519
minutes ago and we aren't even to the

411
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,230
tournament yet Jackie Chan is fine in

412
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,819
this film but mostly this movie makes me

413
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:26,620
wish for a Karate Kid remake with balls

414
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,180
starring Donnie Yen and someone that is

415
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,709
not Will Smith's son and his better at

416
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,509
acting in karate but mostly acting he's

417
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,649
doing the splits on a super high up

418
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,449
that's corner on a roof because of that

419
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,429
one scene from earlier but still and

420
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,870
again I believe this ability can be

421
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,550
equally impressively displayed at ground

422
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:39,819
level

423
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,490
Linda Lewis des Matta Hans take the

424
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,899
student into the arena before the fight

425
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,579
to be glorify the arena itself is

426
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,959
straight out of Hoosiers and I love it

427
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,220
still sending it for being all Hoosiers

428
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,889
oh wait so this giant tournament has

429
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,629
every match covered on a Jumbotron with

430
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,670
graphics points and instant replays even

431
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,899
in the first round or are they saying

432
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,339
that just Dre's match is being covered

433
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:58,720
either way it makes no sense

434
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,339
apologies in advance if I zone out here

435
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,660
the tournament part of this movie is

436
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,100
even more like the film it's rebooting

437
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,839
than any previous portion it moves by

438
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,429
the ref here but at some point wouldn't

439
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,139
this nonsense get you disqualified so

440
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,509
the firing cutting song gets ready to

441
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,459
dr. Dre with his flaming cups let me

442
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,170
remind you one last time that this would

443
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,360
never work ever and that's no diggity so

444
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,499
I know the movie is playing this like

445
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,179
it's a dirty moving on but he did just

446
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:20,949
get a point for it right so if it was

447
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:22,179
legal and what's the issue

448
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,319
Dre's the one who chose to come out here

449
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,819
with a bum knee seems like a very cut

450
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:25,990
and dried example oh don't hate the

451
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,429
player hate the game if you ask me

452
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,110
really every single one of these bad

453
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,639
apples just decided to do a complete

about-face

455
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,740
I haven't seen this much change of heart

456
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,149
since I interned with that cardiac

457

460

living there huh you're rushing it were

461
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,660
you rushing or were you dragging off
