1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,220
welcome back to me time starring me and

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,830
my time something you guys have been

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,660
requesting me to do for a very long time

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,580
which I have finally got my hands on

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,950
because I ordered it on Amazon was the

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,000
most highly rated lash lift kit that

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
there is I've seen plenty of YouTube

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,689
tutorials of people doing this and

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,240
they're all very serious but like it

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,279
looks ridiculous

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,920
it looks insane I have never had my

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,399
lashes lifted before but I have tinted

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,380
them which I have found to be a complete

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,899
waste of time because I'm just gonna put

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,840
mascara over it who are we kidding

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,820
Kermit do not go outside we're having

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,489
inside time this is neat I'm I'm excited

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,890
to try it I'm hoping that my eye lashes

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,469
will touch my eyebrows when I'm finished

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,989
and if they don't I am going to return

21
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:52,649
it I'm kidding

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,199
this one had the highest ratings and it

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,090
had pictures of people that did it and

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,010
they looked like beautiful I'm wondering

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,870
how long it lasts I have so many

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,489
questions like

27
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,210
it says directions for use use the

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,280
cleanser to clean off oil dust and

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,310
makeup residue ooh can I have brows on

30
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,840
because of my brows are on doesn't say

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,490
take your brows off so that's a good

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,800
sign there's only eight steps

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,110
seems legit like you know the kid in

34
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,790
your school that could flip his eyelids

35
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,470
inside out and used to look at you like

36
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,180
that like I could never do that

37
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,399
I'm hoping this fulfills that like deep

38
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,500
desire in me to be that kid because he

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,750
was a weird one but he had a gentle

40
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,520
heart you know I just went upstairs

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,290
because I realized that this kit doesn't

42
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,690
give you any like tools to apply this

43
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,369
stuff and the videos that I've seen

44
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,500
people use q-tips and I literally don't

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,210
have any q-tips well like right now I'm

46
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,009
really wishing that I had some q-tips

47
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,470
because I have a couple of tools that I

48
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,890
think might work but I don't know oh I'm

49
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,490
gonna use the cleanser to clean off my

50
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,550
dusty-ass eyelid ooh okay so I put the

51
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,830
cleansing solution on this brush and

52
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,539
some more eyeshadow came out of it so

53
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,280
clearly I didn't clean it that well dove

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,799
her clean off my eyelid just use a paper

55
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:11,560
towel I didn't need that brush at all I

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,030
don't know what I'm doing I'm also

57
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,590
genuinely interested in this because

58
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,269
I've seen people do it and have pretty

59
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,920
cool results but I'm like are you really

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,230
gonna sit down once in a while and like

61
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,820
maintain your lash perm

62
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,410
I don't know so there was definitely

63
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,110
some mascara left in my eyes from

64
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,299
yesterday I'm just I'm so excited to

65
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,070
have those pads on like I see people

66
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,750
with them on and their lashes flipped up

67
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,090
and I'm like I want that to be me and I

68
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,910
want it now it says apply the eye pads

69
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,549
on the under eyelids to protect our skin

70
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:42,250
from the perming lotion um I don't I

71
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,220
don't see any eye pads okay what a mess

72
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,470
what's the punch of my eyes take my

73
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,600
under eyes oh we just gonna have to hope

74
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,940
and pray that we don't do any damage to

75
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,799
our under eye area from being unprepared

76
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,540
I didn't know that it didn't come with

77
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,560
it I just I thought it did q-tips iPads

78
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,560
kind of youtuber aren't you don't say

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,540
that kind of thing to me put the lip

80
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,390
pads on the eyelash then apply the glue

81
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,510
on the eyelash to keep it sticking on

82
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,000
it's okay it gave me five different

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,610
sizes that one's huge and then there's

84
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,159
some that are like thinner let's try the

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,310
thick one let me bring you in nice and

86
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,640
close yes maybe you put it on like that

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,360
oh yeah love me time wait wait wait

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,910
since these are so big it's probably not

89
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,870
gonna it's gonna give you like oh so if

90
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,459
you use a smaller one it's gonna give

91
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,860
you like a more upright angle right cuz

92
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,980
you're oh I had that backwards in my

93
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,489
mind mmm let's use the little one uh-huh

94
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,150
me too rate up oh here we go

95
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,269
oh you don't apply this to your skin I

96
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,920
guess you just let it sit there and then

97
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,690
you glue your lashes to it so I'm hoping

98
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,629
it'll stay get on up there little babies

99
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,209
I thought you like glued this pad down

100
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,989
to your eye it's not staying hello my

101
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,739
brush will help me prevail hello this is

102
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,060
like truly impossible

103
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,709
I'm finessing them the best that I can

104
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,169
but they won't stay and my eyes are

105
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,669
getting red and irritated already Oh are

106
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,500
you supposed to adhere the pad do you

107
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,960
live like what did I do I need to look

108
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
at the YouTube video I think we should

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,820
start over it seems like I should glue

110
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,800
the lash pad to my lid then put a little

111
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,380
glue on there wait for it to get tacky

112
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,389
like you would like a lash glue and then

113
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,849
like just try and push your lashes up

114
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,169
there so that's what I'm gonna do but I

115
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,789
gotta get all this glue off because I've

116
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,500
just been sitting here putting more and

117
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,320
more glue on not getting anywhere this

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,180
is gonna be fine it's fine this is fine

119
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,610
that one is drying and I'm gonna put the

120
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,560
other one on is that a bad idea so I

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,780
know this doesn't look like progress but

122
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,970
I think we've made progress this is much

123
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,860
trickier than I had originally

124
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,770
anticipated y'all might be laughing now

125
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,990
but y'all are gonna be fucking jealous

126
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,960
them eyelashes and you know it I look

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,020
like a sad dog really not easy because

128
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,350
your eyelashes

129
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,420
really don't want to do this much like a

130
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,220
week from now my eyelashes have fallen

131
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,620
out from being permed viciously this is

132
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,020
already an improvement sort of me time

133
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,160
is stressful today hmm-hmm-hmm my eyes

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
are so watery oh so it's been a fair

135
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,990
amount of struggle but I think that I've

136
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,020
gotten my lashes mostly onto there it

137
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,000
feels terrible but you know what I'm

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,980
gonna be beautiful it says something

139
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,200
about setting the glue use the glue

140
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,540
setting the eyelash on the lift pads

141
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,610
about one minute it has not given me any

142
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,890
type of glue setting so I think that

143
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,700
means just let them air-dry I'm having

144
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,740
knee time it's very difficult for me to

145
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,990
see you I feel like my vision is blurry

146
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,750
and doubled and I'm crying a little but

147
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,530
don't be fooled

148
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm having a good time what if you're

149
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,430
gonna come in here with your judgement

150
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,380
just know that you're not welcome so now

151
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,320
it says to take this perming lotion put

152
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,930
it on and then cover the plastic film

153
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,510
about 8 to 12 minutes what does that

154
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,450
mean cover the plastic film with what oh

155
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,440
this one's like Shh it smells just like

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,780
the perm that I put in my hair like I

157
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,310
don't know how else to describe it other

158
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,380
than like pure sewer water they're

159
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,190
getting unglued no they spent so long

160
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,100
getting them up there oh but now what am

161
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,620
I supposed to do

162
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,960
all my dreams are being crushed right

163
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,940

the perm residue and use this little

225
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,170
yellow thing to give some nutrition back

226
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,209
to my lashes since I've took so much

227
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:14,890
away from them they're just out of

228
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,730
control

229
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,560
please look nothing like the pictures of

230
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,300

231
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,900

232
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,860

233
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,779

234
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,300
very irritated babies because you

235
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,760
blindfolded yourself with plastic I can

236
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,250
feel my lash touching like part of my

237
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,420
eye

238
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,690
okay can't super tell that there was any

239
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,190
difference at all how dare you say that

240
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,270
but it looks good

241
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,340
tell me that it's a drastic change

242
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,460

243
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,990
barely recognize you with those curly

244
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,120
lashes they're so curly are they holding

245
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,560
40 pound dumbbells in the gym because

246
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,180
they're curly are they one of the three

247
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,790
stooges cuz they're curly check your

248
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,240
Twitter

249
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,490
did you really tweet for my account

250
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,390
chillin Julia Marissa tweeted back see I

251
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,830
know this is Julian because it's all

252
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,610
lowercase and Jenna would never go away

253
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,770
my right eye betrayed me my boyfriend

254
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,050
betrayed me as much as I'm dying to put

255
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,790
on mascara and see what they look like

256
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,190
you know with mascara I think that you

257
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,200
should treat them like a regular perm is

258
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,240
what I've seen I think I don't know like

259
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,070
don't wash them or like you know put

260
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,990
stuff on them for a little while

261
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,300
24 hours I don't know is this a look

262
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,190
that I'm really trying to keep not

263
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,840
really but I think I'm gonna give him a

264
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,000
fair chance and like wait for a little

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,220
bit before I do anything to them I will

266
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,560
say that if I could have gotten my right

267
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,430
lashes to stick to that pad this looks

268
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,830
you be pretty like it's just a little

269
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,140
stuff in life that you're like ah oh

270
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,840
that's what this makes me feel like this

271
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,330
one just makes me feel like shit

272
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,120
honestly even still they did end up

273
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,280
being a little curly and I am excited

274
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,110
for my eyes not to feel quite this

275
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,900
irritated overall though I feel like

276
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,540
I'll curl my lashes and put on mascara

277
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,480
and achieve this same look you know do I

278
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,760
need to do this every six weeks and like

279
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,370
make my eyes feel kind of terrible and

280
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,110
like borderline intentionally blind

281
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,620
myself for about a half an hour

282
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,840
I don't know I don't know how long this

283
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,730
is gonna last it says do it every four

284
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,260
to six weeks if you want to maintain it

285
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,880
but just doing the fact that it kind of

286
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,830
irritates my eyes I don't know if I'm

287
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,660
gonna do this again but I think it does

288
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,610
definitely you know like when you curl

289
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,170
your lashes it definitely makes a

290
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,610
difference and makes your eyes look more

291
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,370
open and cool so like yeah I might

292
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,570
please yeah

293
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,630
am I like ecstatic I don't know it's

294
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,490
definitely a lot harder than I thought

295
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,590
it was gonna be this wasn't that easy it

296
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,390
was kind of hard I guess I'll keep you

297
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,940
updated next week when I make my video

298
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,190
let you know how they've been holding up

299
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,290
because I don't have high hopes that

300
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,390
they're gonna stay super curly was this

301

a good me time yeah I had good meantime

302
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,100

303
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,830
times my eyelids hurt let's not get that

304
