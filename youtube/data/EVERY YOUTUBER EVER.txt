3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,000
*Airhorns*

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,400
So I hope you're ready for Davies 2018 slime review!

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,780
Of the 50 slime videos I've posted so far, this one is definitely the craziest!

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,700
OoOoOoOoOoOo! Next week I spin 50 fidgets spinners in a bathtub full of slime!

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:36,969
WHA, you know it. Yeah. I know I'm like 30 and everything, but this is like legitimately what I love doing!

8
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:41,079
Please keep watching me...

9
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,409
Sup you pretty sh*t bags! So let's just get right to the news. So, Twitter is up in a firestorm about Hillary Clinton-

10
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,110
UH OH

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:54,129
You're talking about politics now, that's not suitable for advertisers, de-monetised!

12
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,249
Let's just move right on to our next story, the civil war in Syria is still raging on and there's no-

13
00:00:59,249 --> 00:00:59,829
UH UH

14
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,250
You're talking about violence, we can't have that. DE-MONETISED!

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,049
*sighs*

16
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,660
Let's just move on to our last story of the day. A woman in Nebraska was caught stealing five pounds of biscuit batter- DE-MONETISED!

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,080
ABOUT WHAT, WHAT AM I DE-MONETISED FOR?

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,420
I don't know. You're just de-monetized. Okay. Goodbye!

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,170
Unsubscribe!

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,549
So let's get right to your questions guys, xxmilky toastX X asked,&quot; How do you be successful on YouTube?&quot;.

21
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,049
It's actually really easy. All you have to do is just make content you're excited about!

22
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:42,130
If you want to be successful on YouTube, just make the content you're excited about, as long as you're consistently putting it out.

23
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,390
Always.

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,259
If you want to be successful on YouTube just make the content you're excited about.

25
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,990
As long as you have a good brand and you're a gaming channel, and you upload every single day. Oh and also-

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,729
put boobs in the thumbnail, I mean have you seen our videos?

27
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,469
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,200
Just make content that excites you as long as it exploits YouTube's algorithm as much as possible.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,610
Oh, also if you only have 5 minutes of real content find a way to stretch it out to over 10.

30
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,959
Oh, and uh no more boobs in thumbnail bad idea.

31
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,450
*sighs* Uh okay look if you want to be successful on YouTube, just make a video about Logan Paul, okay?

32
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,319
Another day another apology video.

33
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,080
Okay, so there you have it, my totally unqualified review of the new iPhone, which is barely different from the last one.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,290
But I somehow managed to stretch this video out to 20 minutes with six ad breaks!

35
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,750
Wow, what a phone? It's better than the Android and I can't wait to use this all the time.

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,319
*sighs*

37
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,200
Whew, okay, now only three more to go for the day.

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,500
Now this? This is the new Android and it sh*t's all over the iPhone. I can't wait to use this all the time.

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,620
Dude, perfect!

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,730
Hi, we're twins! We have no discernible talent-

41
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,300
but we're cute, and we're young, and we look the same, and for some reason people seem to like that.

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,740
Here's a parody of YouTube on YouTube.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,300
Hey, Logan Paul, Logan Paul!

44
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,530
What's your response to people saying you shouldn't of dangled that baby off the Eiffel Tower?

45
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:16,739
Uh, I think those people should go buy more of my maverick merch! Haha, Logang, awww.

46
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:28,620
Man.

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:36,150
Killer Keemstar here, this just in, Logan Paul has dropped his chocolate ice cream cone. What a douchebag!

48
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,829
So we challenge Logan Paul to a boxing match, and if he doesn't fight us, and he's a little bitch boy! *laughter*

49
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,230
Sup you filthy f*** faces, so Logan Paul is back in the news again.

50
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,000
This time, for dropping an ice cream cone.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,420
I'm not going to take sides here because what if he just did it as an accident.

52
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,680
We've reached out to Logan Paul and the chocolate ice cream cone company, and they had this to say,

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,200
Quote,&quot;We've never heard of Logan Paul because we're over the age of 15,&quot;.

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,360
Look at the colour of the ice cream, it's brown.

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,040
Logan Paul is racist, there's no doubt about it.

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,900
I want to know your opinions, what did you think really happen? Leave it in the comments down below.

57
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,520
This drama is getting real negative, DE-MONETISE!

58
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,700
NO, the drama videos stay monetised, all of them.

59
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:43,380
