1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,890
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,780
YouTube boogie2988 coming at you levels

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,640
again to the power of the Internet and I

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,930
want to talk to you guys about something

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,550
this is gonna be like a rambling video

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,610
but I'm gonna probably have to add quite

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,130
a bit to be able to get everything all

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,109
into one video so bear with me have you

9
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,430
been paying attention to me on social

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,800
media or even some here in these videos

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,230
you'll know I've been screwing up a lot

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,029
lately left and right and when I got

13
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,890
divorced when I got a gastric bypass

14
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,619
surgery I knew that it was only a matter

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,570
of time before I started coming apart at

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,140
the seams

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,149
that I was going to start making stupid

18
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,920
mistakes that I was going to say stuff I

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,809
was going to disassociate I was gonna do

20
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,390
personalized I was gonna say and do

21
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,540
really stupid stuff and eventually drive

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,879
this whole career this whole channel the

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,710
whole twitch thing just drive it all

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,530
into the ground and I had finally begun

25
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,620
the new hat in the last month or so I'm

26
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,719
surprised it took this long I thought it

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,829
was gonna happen sometime around

28
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,079
December or January but for whatever

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,910
reason it took me six to eight months to

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,460
really start screwing up but here we are

31
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,500
the last last month or so I just keep

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,360
putting my foot in my mouth over and

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,890
over again and I don't want to talk

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,990
about any of those single individual

35
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,580
controversies or any of the stupid

36
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,979
mistakes I've made because I said what I

37
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,990
said I did what I did it's over there's

38
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,670
no making excuses there's nothing like

39
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,320
that I I said some stupid stuff on a

40
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
podcast I said some stupid stuff on

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,009
Twitter I said and done some stupid

42
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,780
stuff that that's where that's where I

43
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,150
am and I don't want to make any excuses

44
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,729
whatsoever and I don't want you making

45
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:30,869
excuses for me either

46
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,990
everything I say everything I do

47
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,689
ultimately Falls entirely on me there's

48
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,790
no circumstance there's no reason

49
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,650
there's no there's nothing about it that

50
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,170
that can then take that away I'm always

51
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,579
responsible for the things that I say

52
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,320
and that I do I'm responsible for this

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
channel I'm responsible for what I say

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,560
in public what I say in social media

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,229
I am fully responsible in the story

56
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,329
period I think one of my biggest regrets

57
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,560
right now is the way that I've treated

58
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,090
this YouTube channel over the last few

59
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,130
months and it's probably not what you

60
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,079
think I don't regret the videos that

61
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,549
only get a hundred thousand views or

62
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,740
50,000 views the stuff like the split

63
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,960
personality podcast I enjoy making that

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,810
so much and I I don't care if half the

65
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,860
number of people that normally watch a

66
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,080
video listen to it and the unboxing is

67
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,680
in the product

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,359
reviews I don't care that not as many

69
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,980
people are watching him I enjoy doing

70
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,689
that content that content is something

71
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,939
I'm excited about I'm invigorated about

72
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,010
I can't wait to come and film it I can't

73
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,959
come and wait to do it it's really

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,760
exciting to me I love doing that stuff

75
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,500
so I don't regret that for a second even

76
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,180
if you don't like watching it what I do

77
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,620
regret is some of the personal videos

78
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,269
and even though those videos are some of

79
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,280
my most viewed videos every week and

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,609
this one might even be the case and I do

81
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,170
love sharing and stuff because I do know

82
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,459
it's doing some good people at VidCon

83
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,079
told me how important it is to me it

84
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,280
helped me the divorce help me with my

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,329
surgery helped me with my weight loss

86
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,540
help me with my abuse stuff even though

87
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,220
it is very very helpful to some people I

88
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,569
feel like I could have handled it better

89
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,159
I felt like I could have done it better

90
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,439
I love sharing that personal stuff with

91
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,790
you but maybe I shouldn't share it as

92
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,129
often and maybe I shouldn't share every

93
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,310
grisly disgusting detail maybe some of

94
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,439
that is better left to mystery some of

95
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,780
it's better left unsaid and I think

96
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,730
moving forward I do still want to talk

97
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,469
about this topics and how they affect me

98
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:13,469
but maybe maybe not in the exact same

99
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,450
way but I think my biggest regret is

100
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,940
ever talking about politics at all

101
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,859
because for those so many years people

102
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,510
are saying boogie get a spine pick a

103
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,120
side fight for that side and that's not

104
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,889
that's not who I am that's not who I am

105
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,669
as a person I I'm just kind of existing

106
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,409
here I don't have a lot to fight for

107
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,209
I don't want to fight I'm not a fighter

108
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,430
man I and so when I get involved in that

109
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,709
stuff I regret it so much and the major

110
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,650
reason I regret it is simply this it

111
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,970
doesn't matter which side you pick

112
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,370
doesn't matter what you say someone out

113
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,169
there is going to get hurt by it and I

114
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:48,239
despise hurting you guys I despise

115
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,639
hurting anybody I don't even when my

116
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,040
intentions are really really good I end

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,810
up hurting people and that's the last

118
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,000
thing I want to do I want to heal people

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,370
I want to help people I do not want to

120
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,979
hurt anybody so I am so done with that

121
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,319
I'm just completely done with anything

122
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,389
political for the rest of my youtube

123
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,639
career I don't care if it if it will

124
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,269
affect me personally 110 percent I will

125
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,159
not put it on this channel and I'll try

126
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,320
to keep it off social media - that seems

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,909
a lot harder than you think though

128
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,650
because everything is politicized

129
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,000
anymore it doesn't even matter is it

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,950
even video games man how did we get to

131
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,320
that point where pac-man is politicized

132
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,970
but all of this has seemed to

133
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,980
had a really weird impact on the channel

134
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,390
and the channel is in a really weird

135
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,180
place right now because I've a number of

136
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,460
views on a monthly basis are way way up

137
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,740
I'm doing very very good but the

138
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,440
individual video views are way way down

139
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,870
and I'm not really sure exactly what

140
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,480
that is or exactly how to fix it I and

141
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
I'm not blaming anybody but myself it's

142
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
it's the content I'm creating in the way

143
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
that I created and then the types and

144
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,620
the order that I have posted so I know

145
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,170
if I pick a plan I know I've got you the

146
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,460
person watching this right now I know

147
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,010
you will watch my content so I just need

148
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,270
to pick a plan and let you know what

149
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,620
that plan is so that's what I want to do

150
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,360
for the rest of this video I want to

151
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,100
tell you how I'm gonna get you dig

152
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,570
myself out of this hole if it's at all

153
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,520
possible about once a week I want to do

154
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,260
a gaming news wrap-up every Thursday

155
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,020
night my sponsors love to do it I love

156
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,820
to create it hopefully it'll go live at

157
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,050
the end of every week and we'll talk

158
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,940
about what happened that week those

159
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,100
videos do varyingly well sometimes it's

160
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,270
two hundred thousand views sometimes

161
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,919
it's a hundred thousand views it doesn't

162
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,990
really matter as long as it's as long as

163
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,490
somebody's watching and I enjoy making

164
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,140
it I'm gonna make sure I'm trying to do

165
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,880
that at least once a week maybe

166
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,350
sometimes twice a week if there's a lot

167
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,600
of news this split personality podcast I

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
really like making it we've done three

169
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,380
episodes now they're doing fairly

170
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,090
decently I think as more of them come

171
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,010
out more people will listen to them and

172
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,660
give them a fair shot I'll link to those

173
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,040
in the description box in the comment

174
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,270
section below I really hope you give

175
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,979
them a listen because I I really like

176
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,320
making it it's me interviewing one of my

177
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,180
characters or maybe two characters

178
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,800
interviewing each other at some point I

179
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,510
don't know it's the most creative thing

180
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,700
I've ever done and I really enjoy doing

181
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,930
it and I really hope that you guys will

182
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,940
give it a fair chance because I think it

183
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,410
might be the best thing I've ever done

184
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,750
on YouTube even if it's not and even if

185
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,910
it proves not to be that successful it's

186
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,200
my favorite thing I'm producing right

187
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,700
now so I'm definitely gonna do way more

188
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,110
of that and at least once a week I'm

189
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,370
gonna try to create a very personal

190
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,380
video like this it might be about the

191
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,940
YouTube channel it might be about

192
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,710
YouTube in general it might be about my

193
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,660
life it might be about my divorce and

194
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,950
right mental health or something like

195
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,020
that my weight loss all of that stuff I

196
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,820
think it's the most important thing I do

197
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,050
here on this channel and even though

198
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,370
it's not always fun and even though a

199
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,750
lot of people despise that type of

200
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,630
content a lot of people do enjoy it and

201
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,700
the people that do enjoy it it's really

202
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,220
helped to some people it's the grueling

203
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,870
is the most difficult part of this job

204
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,180
and and I get the most hate for it

205
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,840
but if it only helped one per

206
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,720
it's worth it and I promise you based on

207
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,130
feedback it's helped a hell of a lot

208
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,660
more than one person and I do want to

209
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,310
continue to experiment so I'm gonna try

210
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,320
to keep up that weekly schedule and then

211
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,880
in between those videos on the weekend

212
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,370
maybe Tuesday maybe Thursday I will film

213
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,810
something that feels fun or interesting

214
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,970
and I will upload it here maybe it'll be

215
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,800
a movie review it'll be vlogs when I

216
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,630
travel it'll be vlogs and I throw events

217
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,100
at the house I mean my friends will do

218
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,770
stupid stuff I I don't know if I want to

219
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,030
upload every day anymore

220
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,250
five days a week six days a week but

221
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,750
maybe I will as long as there's plenty

222
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,030
of odd and weird content all I want to

223
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,590
know is that if you're interested in

224
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,960
still watching that kind of stuff and

225
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,250
whether or not you're gonna click on it

226
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,630
if you don't click on it I'll produce

227
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,220
less of it if you do click on it will

228
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,470
produce more of it it says it's just up

229
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,790
to you it depends on what you guys are

230
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,650
watching I might even produce it and

231
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,180
never put it on this channel or maybe

232
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,650
create a second channel to put it there

233
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,630
I'll continue to produce the stuff that

234
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,090
I like to produce if you want to watch

235
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,470
it that's great if you don't that's okay

236
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,880
too I just don't want to kill the

237
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,380
channel I don't want to flood your sub

238
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,330
box with stuff you don't want to see but

239
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,130
the most important initiative I have

240
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,620
going forward is I'm going to focus a

241
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,169
lot more on self-care I don't know that

242
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,580
I'll ever take the break everyone

243
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,979
thought that I needed to take but I am

244
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:53,020
going to take smaller little doses of

245
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,430
time sometimes I'm going to miss a

246
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,080
stream is sometimes I'm going to miss an

247
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
upload sometimes I'm going to choose to

248
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,710
go out with a friend or go hang out with

249
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,169
somebody and just do something fun I'm

250
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,270
going to focus on taking care of me for

251
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,530
a while probably for the rest of the

252
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,630
summer and I hope you guys can bear with

253
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,700
me as I do that sometimes I'm gonna

254
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,919
share with you the most important aspect

255
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,580
of self carriers is undone engaging with

256
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,560
this stuff on social media I'm done

257
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,750
reading the hateful little subreddits

258
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,100
I'm done reading the hateful little

259
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,830
forums I'm done engaging with negative

260
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,780
people on Twitter I just can't do it

261
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,270
anymore I just I honest to god I can't

262
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,190
do it anymore it's killing me I hired

263
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,020
some mods to take over my subreddit I'm

264
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,180
not gonna be looking there anymore I I

265
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,709
probably won't pay that a close

266
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,750
attention to my ATS and my emails and

267
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,370
stuff like that just because I'm not in

268
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,719
a place that I can do it anymore and

269
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,700
more importantly more importantly I'm

270
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,229
just going to try to stop saying stupid

271
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,910
stuff that upsets and hurts people

272
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,380
because that's the last thing I want to

273
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,060
be doing with my life I don't wanna hurt

274
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,490
anybody I don't want to upset anybody so

275
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,779
I'm just done with it

276
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,670
I'm just done with it and hopefully in

277
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,870
one day I'll be strong enough to be able

278
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,120
to do this stuff again but I'm

279
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,949
definitely not there right now so right

280
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,870
now I gotta focus on my mental health

281
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,389
and my physical health and then my job

282
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,550
third so I'm gonna make you a deal you

283
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,079
the person sitting there watching right

284
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,209
now I'm gonna keep making content I'm

285
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,439
gonna try to make it upbeat and positive

286
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,930
and fun except once a week we're to get

287
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,139
down into the dark dirty messy stuff but

288
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,519
I promise I won't keep it political I

289
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,110
promise I'll make sure that it's it's

290
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,550
about me and hopefully you can learn

291
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,139
from it and hopefully can make your life

292
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,249
a little bit better because that's all I

293
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:24,910
want to do anymore

294
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,649
I want to make your life better and I

295
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,120
don't worried about the views and not

296
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,199
worry about the money I'm not worried

297
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,059
about anything else I'm just worried

298
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,100
about keeping you entertained and making

299
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,569
you laugh and maybe hoping you feel

300
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:35,920
something every once in a while and just

301
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,259
enjoy your time here spending it with me

302
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,970
that's it I'm gonna go get ready for

303
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,589
stream and get ready to produce some fun

304
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,209
content and do my fourth of July vlog

305
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,459
and I want to say I thank you so much

306
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,930
for bearing with me thank you so much

307
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,389
for watching I love you very much I'll

308
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,699
speak with you again soon just in case

309
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:52,689
you're one of the people that need it

310
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,000
spelled out for you I'm sorry
