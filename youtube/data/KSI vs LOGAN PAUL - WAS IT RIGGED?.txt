did you watch the fight between me and

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,100
Logan I I thought you would one judges

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,010
said it was the majority draw whatever

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:49,500
that means I think you won because you

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,250
hit them more than him yeah I like that

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,750
I'll take that think he got more punch

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,579
yourself but whoa really

15
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,020
he got what he hit he landed more

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,850
punches but I thought I landed more

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,390
punches

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,579
I'm sure he's not hit by engine I mean

19
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,110
he did a lot missing okay who do you

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,500

well it was a shame it was a draw yeah I

85
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,580
think that look and then he gets to

86
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,470
cookie he laughs every time you punch

87
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,570
him you hit him so hard in his last

88
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,150
round five and six he stopped being

89
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,300
cocky I know cuz he got scared I think

90
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,510
you're gonna window well what if I

91
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,310
happen you always like this is someone

92
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,100
here but like through Logan can't even

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,750
fight in one is white guy you're like I

94
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,480
still mean I'm kidding

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,510
what the first two are definitely

96
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,730
looking Paul I thought you lost uh but

97
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,770
after that you came back you actually

98
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,940
want him I was pretty surprised actually

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,560
they're gonna think you're gonna win

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,600
yeah we say you're way funnier

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
competitive Logan

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,920
this talk is way too awful like it well

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,780
we talked about the fight over the jobs

104
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,720
the fight yeah like about you and Logan

105
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,000
I think you're gonna win beside your one

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,280
that make your string with the Logan

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,580
that's why I guess is is Logan woo I

108
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,440
know that you are K is I but I don't

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,940
know the Logan guy mad you should want I

110
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,910
should have won yeah you destroyed him

111
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,800
alright I like I like your recent video

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
the one where you you know talked about

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,360
how you won the fight I thought six six

114
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,700
round definitely attend a and I watched

115
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,389
Logan's yesterday and

116
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,400
he was sure about you know the dirt

117
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,460
taxes I don't know but I mean notice how

118
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,110
he's constantly talking about the dirty

119
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,030
tactics and I should lost the point

120
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,400
rather than showing how he won the fight

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,060
convincingly I wonder first me say if it

122
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,560
was like a real fight I would have won

123
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,069
that was a love holding Pullman I think

124
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,460
he just like touching my black skin he

125
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,669
was obsessed with it what so what's up

126
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,159

137

says it's there the same thing but it's

148
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,830
different I felt like I was the tallest

149
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,029
worse than that I mean you are pretty

150

I saw no black people in Japan did you

157
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,349
think it was rigged I really it was

158
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,110
rigged this is a graph like I told you

159
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,930
for the rough work did I was did a few

160
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,539
things to try and do you mean the part

161
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,710
was rigged

162
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,990
kind of missing okay it's gonna come off

163
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,350
how was the rage it's like I didn't like

164
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,729
I didn't see that much length in

165
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,289

gonna win no but the fight the fight

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,310
already happened it was a draw is it but

170
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,210

ruling out 100% if I'm being really out

177
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,320
even all the first conferences you know

178

there's all this entertainment side to

180
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,150
it and I think at the end of there

181
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,560
you're entertaining crowds as well and

182
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
they're all expecting there's a

183
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,950
cliffhanger you know the matter is no

184
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,690
