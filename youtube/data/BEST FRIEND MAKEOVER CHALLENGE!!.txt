little bit be a little more fun I'm

116
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,290
realizing now the way he dresses says a

117
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,170
lot about his personality it's like I'm

118
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,950
it's like a very very very yeah very

119
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,130
straight statement mm-hmm and not too he

120
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,770
stays like very neutral so his videos

121
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,170
can speak for what he does whereas you

122
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,330
and me we need to overcompensate for

123
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:55,020
what we lack in challenge love dressing

124
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,240

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,559
wear them Wow because it's just not me

171
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,000
jeans are very common think that

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,829
everybody wears I know I'm just like a

173
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,079
black Jean guy Wow a pair of black jeans

174
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,729
take off the sweater with that real

175
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:39,569
quick feels weird

176
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,870
this is my favorite I don't like it at

177
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,639
all see these are the shirts that are

178
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,129
like so bougie I know I hate I hate how

179
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,319
the sure feels like cheaper shirts I

180
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,850
don't like this look material of like

181
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,120
soft so even when you go to like the the

182
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,829
VMAs or something I really like the

183
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:59,460
sweatshirt I got that I think

184
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,740
he feels like I can go anywhere not a

185
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,890
good time okay have to get out of it

186
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,260
okay we'll take the sweatshirt and take

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,790
two more items of clothes that you would

188
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,470
wear that sweatshirt worth so we can see

189
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,050
what your style is you said you don't

190
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,910
like the jeans well you do without your

191
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,250
outfit with this is very drunk frat guy

192
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,060
that outfit that you got the rugby shirt

193
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,130
yeah where's the college's we're going

194
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,350
yeah so I guess I win cuz I picked out

195
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,149
the sweater why would the bottom hoodie

196
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,649
he picked out the hoodie

197
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,360
yeah but realistically I improved the

198
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,940
sweater before yeah he did saying like

199
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,459
this true but I did pick it out so you

200
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,160
all time I actually think the the camel

201
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,310
outfit you bought him yeah I really

202
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,140
liked it I think we came off it was the

203
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,029
coolest that's what I think I think I'm

204
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,440
judging them in a weird way I think you

205
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,850
should be judging him like what I like

206
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,740
like I did like enemy came off it was

207
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,240
pretty sick but you wouldn't wear it I

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,279
wouldn't wear it why like it was cool it

209
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,930
