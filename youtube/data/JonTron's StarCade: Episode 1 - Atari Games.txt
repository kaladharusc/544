Flying Saucer

4

and maybe next time you'll think for a

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,240
second before you pick up someone saying

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,349
they need to get to the nearest hospital

7
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:29,059
as fast as they can it jumps alright now

8
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,770
just to take this thing for a spin past

9

lesson

won't because I very well let's see if

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,820
this persuades

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,970
that's not my throat your will is strong

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,330
I'll give you that but I have one last

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,100
thing I'm certain will pique your

43
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,150
interest

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,670
John save me me I'm your bird friend

45
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,990
dark dog

46
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,400
what how'd you get Chuck I have my ways

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,650
now to show our business oh no he's just

48
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:56,010
a boy let me give you a taste of what's

49
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,500
to come unless you comply to my demands

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,380
I fine I'll do it what what do you want

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,240
me to do you were to play every Star

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,420
Wars video game for me even the poopy

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,610
ones poopy ones

54
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,040
I need footage for my upcoming let's

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,180
play Channel

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,150
I plan on calling it Darth underscore

57
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,270
Vader underscore likes Green Day 1992

58
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,550
seriously that's what you're gonna call

59
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,650
it you'd be better off calling it

60
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:34,270
something stupid like Starrcade

61
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,730
so many Star Wars games spanning so many

62
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,200
decades where does one even begin

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,910
especially when he doesn't even have any

64
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,500
of them your Vader if you want me to do

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,420
this you got to give me the game course

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:58,420
a smart oversight

67
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,880
hey cow what the hell

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,140
seriously come on man don't you know

69
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,850
that I want to do this give me your

70
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:21,130
empire budget I said good one thank you

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,810
this game is a port of the 1983 arcade

72
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,820
game of the same name that used the now

73
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,680
outdated vector style of graphics which

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,770
we'll get to later and wow look at this

75
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,650
box if you were a kid in 1983 chances

76
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,790
are you would have thought this was

77
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,470
pretty cool you'll probably like this

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:51,960
guy right here

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,300
died the way he lived like a goddamn

80
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,790
psychopath with an advertisement like

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,140
that you know you're getting into

82
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,240
something good let's go to the moon baby

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,470
or space which way is this going now I

84
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,660
don't want to be overly critical but I

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,950
can't help but feel there may have been

86
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,050
a slight exaggeration made in that

87
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,650
commercial all right man come on we get

88
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,340
it calm down

89
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,960
maybe the sequel will fare better they

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,120
also made Empire Strikes Back on Atari

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,530
but weirdly enough this one came out

92
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,530
before the first one I don't get it

93
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,960
either

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,490
hey that's nice you get the real music

95
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,110
in the game not all tie ins gave you

96
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,490
that back in the day so believe it or

97
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,409
not that's actually a bonus I'm not so

98
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,819
sure what's going on on the bottom of

99
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,020
the screen though is that a horizontal

100
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,060
radar of someone constantly firing a

101
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,370
bullet and speaking understanding I

102
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,689
don't really understand where I am in

103
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,639
space or time is that the mountains or

104
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,099
are we under seat if those are mountains

105
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,479
what would that make these subterranean

106
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,000
mountains Atari games are hilarious they

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,650
just merely hint at what is actually

108
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,360
supposed to be going on you could have

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
called this game bird vs. camel and no

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,530
one would have argued with you don't

111
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,000
believe me look you're a bot this

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,979
wouldn't you open this box art to

113
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,539
complete the trilogy there's Return of

114
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,699
the Jedi Death Star battle it's a good

115
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,050
thing they went with the Death Star not

116
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,300
some he walks yeah that would have been

117
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,360
weird ah yes I remember this classic

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,969
Star Wars situation now we know why han

119
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,710
Solo was late to help Luke in the Death

120
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,750
Star battle he first had to cut a hole

121
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,969
through a large David Bowie's album art

122
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,039
for it to get there you fly around as

123
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,569
the adorable Millennium Falcon like

124
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,860
you're playing asteroids and you're

125
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,020
supposed to I guess go through this tear

126
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,120
to get to the Death Star so you can

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:45,300
destroy it

128
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,500
hmm I don't remember the dead start

129
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,090
sounding so much like my dad's office

130
00:06:49,090 --> 00:07:01,780
who left the fax machine on again Wow

131
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,960
it made this look harder in the movies

132
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,880
in this version they decided to make the

133
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:15,970
death star out of styrofoam oh we play

134
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,260
that back in Reverse I think I might

135
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,760
have heard the voice of Satan in there

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,470
this scene is gruff not like you

137
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,270
okay I guess we're just gonna pretend

138
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,440
nothing happened then

139
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
business as usual this game just keeps

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,460
looping forever once you beat the

141
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,620
Deathstar there's no level two good god

142
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,509
it's like a Star Wars Groundhog Day in

143
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:37,990
here

144
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,750
yikes moving on how about this one Star

145
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,759
Wars Jedi arena where Luke doesn't look

146
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,120
like he gives a at all

147
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,009
okay what's been going on in here hey

148
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,990
alright maybe you could just you know

149
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,120
slow down stop stop stop okay let's just

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,919
move on to the last game we have here

151
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,870
today which is Return of the Jedi Ewok

152
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,400
adventure but I don't have it here to

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,520
show to you in fact few if any do it was

154
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,469
intended to be the twin sister game of

155
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,599
Return of the Jedi Death Star battle but

156
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,250
it was never released even though it was

157
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,440
fully completed yeah that's a good sign

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,300
it disappeared without a trace for 14

159
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,069
years until being found by a collector

160
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,620
in 1997 for fear of a lawsuit it was

161
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,150
never released to the public but lucky

162
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,430
for us in 2001 a prototype copy was

163
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,800
finally secured although only one of

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,319
these is known to exist what could it

165
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,029
cause them to cancel a perfectly good

166
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,880

recreate UOC adventure and make it

168
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,700
snappy recreating is to you I'm not sure

169
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,289
what kind of ship you're flying in this

170
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,849
game but I already like it better than

171
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,560
the other games it seems to be some kind

172
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,300
of speeder that flies close to the

173
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,920
ground it has weight and it's really

174
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,140
cool as far as the Atari goes you know

175
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,290
look at the 80s tease oh my god I'm

176
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,880
gonna have nightmares now let's give you

177
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,649
an artist's rendition of what the HD

178
00:08:53,649 --> 00:09:02,860
version would look like terrifying yep

179
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,959
that's about how I feel that was trippy

180
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,029
as hell do I still have my brain intact

181
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,000
after that okay here we go

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,220
Oh crashed my ship

183
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,880

184
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,279

185
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,230

where you getting who's that belong to

187
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,529
that is not

188
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,569
 believe it or not I think this is

189
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:34,800
actually the best game out of them all

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,939
and it's the only one they didn't

191
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,560
release maybe they wanted it all to

192
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,589
themselves who could blame them oh boy

193
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,600
and that's only a tiny fraction oh we

194
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,060
got to cover so stick around and tune in

195
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,680

196
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,439
mystery of who was who allegedly let

197
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,819
those dogs out after all

198
00:09:50,819 --> 00:10:26,000
