New York City landmark laws and you can

10
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,560
get away with so much in the city but

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,690
when it comes like actually building

12
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,210
stuff is an enormous enormous pain in

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,550
the ass so we're able to overcome that

14

certain amount of social media followers

51
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,530
to get booked that's that's definitely a

52
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,329
true fact because I've definitely

53
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,680

[Music]

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:18,940
didn't always turn

104
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,800
see the idea with this front space at

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,570
three six eight there's not two just

106
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,220
have like a retail outlet where we sell

107
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,540
t-shirts but they have it'd be like an

108
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,240
active there's always something going on

109
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,100
and that's why we're gonna start with

110
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,320
Jeremy having is like tattoo parlor here

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,970
and then they'll be an area over there

112
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,980
where you can't actually buy stuff it's

113
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,690
a way of having a part of three six

114
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,670
eight be interactive with the public and

115
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,780
open to the public

116
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,870
when is this am I making any sense yeah

117
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,180
these canals just waiting for you to say

118
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,000
there's gonna be a skate trap the public

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
that's never for the public that's for

120
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,460
us I'm sorry that the legalities of

121
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,240
having a public skate park okay so all

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,250
that's left now is the bit that goes

123
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,320
onto my hand and onto my finger and we

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,980
are done

125
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,340
brace yourself for this rose water the

126
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,280
fingers painful

[Music]

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,539
all right so this tattoo that says New

129
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,450
York City's summer 2018 and really I

130
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,849
just drew this in like two seconds on a

131
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,650
cardboard box over there and Jeremy put

132
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,080
it on my arm but the reason why I got

133
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,390
this is like all of my tattoos are sort

134
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,400
of notes that capture like a moment in

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,260
my life I've made a movie about this

136
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,860
it's linked below and summer 2018 is

137
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,990
like the last summer where before

138
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,550
Kinison I have another kid it's the last

139
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,900
time with just one baby in the house

140
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,030
it's maybe even my last summer where I

141
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,100
live in New York City it's the first

142
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,080
summer where I started 368 it's the

143
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,480
first summer where the Dan was here and

144
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,640
this is just it just feels like I really

145
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,820
I really like this year has been a

146
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,920
inflection point like a turning point in

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,740
my whole life and this is just a way to

148
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:25,370
capture that moment forever I'll see you

149
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,290
back from my trip

150
