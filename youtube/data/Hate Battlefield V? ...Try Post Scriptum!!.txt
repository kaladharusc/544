what's up soldiers general angry Joe

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,560
here and I wanted to tell you about post

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,359
scriptum that's not a promo video this

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,849
is just a game that I found and I really

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,700
liked and I wanted to help support it so

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,309
this is a war war to historically

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,740
accurate World War two you look at

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,140
battlefield man battlefield fives

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,740
trailers getting down voter 318,000 down

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,590
votes to 277 up votes now I think that's

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,449
probably a little bit of trolling from

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,010
Call of Duty people getting their

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,830
revenge from what happened last time but

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,450
also I think people are complaining

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,680
about you know the social justice war

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,340
here propaganda on feminazi garbage if

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,530
that's one of you come on pull yourself

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,879
out of the muck you're you're you're

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,190
you're far too insulated and in some

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,079
dark places on the Internet has nothing

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,789
to do with that has to do with money all

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,050
right because they're doing

23
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,329
customization cosmetic customization

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,250
they want as much cosmetic customization

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,320
as possible and females are an option

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,590
and for me it doesn't bother me but I

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,199
can kind of see the point from some

28
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,299
people who want a more historically

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,340
accurate game so if you're one of those

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,780
people complaining whether you're

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,580
legitimately complaining about it

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,380
whether you're a red hat trying to make

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,060
this political or whether you're just

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,439
talking about the stupid charges

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,110
trolling I want you to support post

36
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,030
scriptum because this you're not gonna

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,360
find any women in the game at all okay

38
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,549
this is a sausagefest just for you guys

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,590
but it's more historically accurate it's

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,409
based on simulation so if you put ever

41
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,350
played squad this is basically squad in

42
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,409
World War two it's a tough game you have

43
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,600
to really put some time and effort into

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,150
learning it but the experience you get

45
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,619
out of it it's it's so it's so immersive

46
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,540
so the footage you're about to see here

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,079
is me as a squad leader angry Joe and

48
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,659
and I tried to take my squad as the

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,630
Germans where we probably make fun of

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,939
the voice just messing around sorry

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,070
about that we do get serious later on

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,619
and I don't know this is one of those

53
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,540
games that really makes you want to

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,369
roleplay and everybody on the server

55
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,509
starts role-playing and when that

56
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,670
happens it's really really cool but

57
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,470
we're attacking I think

58
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,750
British position and trying to win this

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,120
match so if you if you're one of those

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,710
complaining about historical accuracy

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,200
give give post scriptum a chance and see

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
if it's something you might like it's

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,220
not gonna be as it's made by eight dudes

64
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,100
so don't expect battlefield 5 levels of

65
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,750
production but at least you're gonna

66
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,060
kind of get more what you were thinking

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,070
that maybe you wanted so but see here's

68
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,840
the great thing is I think there's room

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
enough for both of these games

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,930
battlefield is want what fifth ninth

71
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,390
game or something like that so it's fine

72
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,100
if they want to put females and try uh

73
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,860
more holes at the top Call of Duty's

74
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,930
like single-player it seems like they're

75
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,400
picking up the slack from Call of Duty

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,850
that's whether their trailer was so

77
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,130
ridiculous and they kind of Call of Duty

78
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,860
it but yeah so I think I think that's

79
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,290
what's going on but hopefully you have

80
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,350
fun watching this and and laugh and have

81
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,780
