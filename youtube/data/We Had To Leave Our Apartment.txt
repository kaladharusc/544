not sure I don't know how much they're going to Smee up but this might have to

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,379
be like a silent episode or like a music video or just like 10 minutes of montage

8
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,770

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,740
Candace

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,930
leaving the eyeball

40
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,930
exciting this year mom

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:26,640
yeah

42
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,430
don't find him here and you know any more room for stuff

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,459
what wing and the lady bag that matches heart by candace later really good luck

44
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,430
right I'm going to go

45
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,569
it's not that I don't want to be supportive of Brian Emily's new baby

46
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,959
it's just that I mean I love those guys but I feel like Candace is Jarvis

47
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,340
part of the trouble

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:01,860
having oral surgery at 9am is that her little that eat anything today and that

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,860
sucks

50
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,030
the image tell me

51
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,480
they're pretty easy to do

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,810
yeah

53
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,709
they're like literally -

54
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,220
gas stations at all downtown Manhattan look at this line for gas

55
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,410
blocking traffic

56
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,710
to go to one of these pumps

57
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:37,580
I was thinking about talking about this and then I was like I'm not going to

58
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,410
talk about it and then I was like I should talk about it and then I was like

59
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,650
okay i'll talk about it so I'm going to talk about it as I was finishing the

60
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,380
Edit for yesterday's episode

61
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,539
I learned like the horrible horrible terror attack in France and today's

62
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,590
episode i include what I would describe like a gesture of sympathy to the people

63
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,229
of France and whatever I make gestures of sympathy in in this vlog the reaction

64
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,320
is always positive but without exception

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,300
there are always comments akin to a nice to see what you did today but the world

66
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,020
needs to realize bigger stuff is happening is really disappointed Casey

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,680
now you honor the deaths in France but you haven't talked about the Dallas shoe

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,250
case you know that people died and Casey why be sad for the front you think you

69
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,070
should raise more awareness for the people this is not the news

70
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,000
they're just sometimes I see things and and I feel it's appropriate to

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,599
acknowledge them sometimes huge things happen and I don't acknowledge them but

72
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,770
it's a the attacking nice was particularly personal for me own and I

73
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,830
were in Nice around that same street where the where the incident happened

74
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,750
where there are three months ago

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,039
like right there the bigger point is this to show your support to show

76
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,020
sympathy for one thing is not to say that you're against or you don't have

77
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,729
sympathy for another thing

78
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,380
there's no hierarchy here so they can liken it to is like say you visit your

79
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,030
Nana in the hospital

80
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,500
who's in room 603 just because you're there to see Nana doesn't mean you don't

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,159
feel bad for everybody else in that hospital but when you walk in to see

82
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,789
Nana the nurse doesn't say I'm disappointed in you Casey

83
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,389
how could you not visit everyone else in this hospital i bring this up not

84
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,030
because my feelings are hurt i don't get it but that's up

85
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,530
I bring this up because it is empathy it's the ability to show that I feel

86
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,639
your pain

87
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,159
that makes us human beings and the monsters that shoot police in dallas for

88
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,169
that monster that that ran people down in a truck in France or a monster that

89
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,740
sets off a bomb in medina these people

90
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,170
they don't have the empathy that that makes us human the empathy that makes us

91
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,750
people and to constantly criticized people like me for how I choose to show

92
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,750
empathy is to discourage that very human emotion and emotions so powerful that

93
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,340
it's an essential part of of the healing process and that healing process the

94
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,420
showing of empathy

95
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,380
it's what the world needs a lot of right now it shouldn't be discouraged

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,430
because her mom your friends are here we don't have a places tonight so maybe

97
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,110
we'll stay there in a hotel or staying at a friend's apartment

98
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:32,500

99
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,980

102
