LWIAY, YouTube's greatest show, everybody!

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,400
The show where I, review the meme. :3

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
It's very unique and it's different from all of my other shows trust me!

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,420
Trust me! Okay? (Sure Pewds. I as a fellow 9 year old will never doubt my wonderful leader!)

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,820
No, honestly it feels like I haven't done this in a while. Am i right with that assumption? :/ (I dunno)

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,460
Either way, let's check out what you guys, posted on the reddit. &quot;The Pewdiepie Submissions&quot;

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,340
My man was going for the handshake...This is so sad (Can we hit 1000 likes?)

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:12,080
i've seen this already. can someone please, can someone please give that dog a handshake?

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,420
can someone please do something?

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,220
wait this has 33 thousand uploads

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,360
this is one of the most upvoted reddit post on the pewdiepie submissions, great

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,220
ah great, this again. eat the kid's damn picture, really?

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,120
you know what? i'm not even reacting to this. I'm moving on. i don't need this

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,700
I don't need this judgment. by the way, your handwriting is terrible

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,660
moving on

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,680
marzia big serve meme (???)

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,640
the wedding is off until felix eats the kid's picture, i'm not about to marry a coward

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,700
my own future wife

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,680
has turned against me. is this where we finally

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
fight

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,220
is this our first little fight?

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,860
just cause i don't eat this child? you're all mad at me?

36
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,340
what if I don't eat him, huh? what are you gonna do, unsubscribe?

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,160
oooh- wait, actually T-Series is coming, please guys

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,140
I need you just for a little bit longer

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,640
face lampshade set out to eat my face

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,780
and i said-

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:26,459
until I ate a picture of him, and I said, okay, a hundred. as a joke. i didn't think the mad lad would do it

42
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,840
your blood is now completely diluted with the essence of pewdiepie

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,500
first of all, I will not do any more of these challenges, okay

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,069
if I see you do one I will ignore it

45
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,260
but I will eat the kid at the end of this video

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,300
just do it pewds

47
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,800
even youtube. even youtube

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,580
lmao ok if pewdiepie eats a picture of that kid we'll stop demonetizing his videos

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,660
man i''m excited. I've never aten- eaten paper, so uh

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,740
never eaten a child

51
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,080
so we'll see how it goes. i'm excited

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,060
pathetic. if I ever make a diss track burn some trash garbage

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,120
and legit make me inhale it

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,380
till i die

55
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,020
well i'm about to do that, so

56
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,580
you guys need to stop holding me accountable for all the things I said

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,160
to be fair, okay

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,920
Everyone made diss tracks, okay

59
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,100
It was the clickbait of last year. you want views? just make a stupid diss track. and they were all pretty terrible

60
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,750
now i know my diss track isn't the best one. if anything it falls on the lower end of anything

61
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:42,349
but it still floats above all the most youtuber diss tracks that I've seen and it was made completely ironically

62
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,040
i don't know how so many people seem to miss that point

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,820
i had people going like well, you said you didn't care about T-Series whatdatah- well it's a joke!

64
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,760
it's a joke

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,340
do I have to explain every time I make a joke?

66
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,340
a blue whale's vagina is so big and deep that five to six men can easily lay down in it

67
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,040
making it the world's next biggest pussy after

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,620
don't make me- i will hurt people

69
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,100
are there gonna be any material that doesn't involve this child? i need to know this right now

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,400
okay that's pretty cool *laughs*

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,560
konichiwa. woah, i read a word in japanese

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,340
nihongo desu nae (???)

73
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,480
the real rap god

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,760
i'm surprised you guys liked the video. i'm- i'm happily surprised

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,120
when me and brad shot it i kept going

76
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,940
I don't care, like let's just film it. it's whatever. I like, we have a new video that needs to go up tomorrow

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,660
it doesn't matter. let's just film it

78
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,480
and then during the editing process i just immediately turned into a psychopath

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,760
and went, you need to cut all of this, you need to fix this, this is exactly-

80
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,380
but yeah, I think it was worth it. it was a fun meme

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,900
what if felix doesn't eat the kids picture? he's a sociopath?

82
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,600
oh!

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,380
i feel like a lot of people misunderstood the video. i don't have a personal problem with katie or shane

84
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,780
and I don't think they made the video in any bad intention. i just thought it was a bad video

85
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,800
that's right. i'm backtracking now

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,860
backtracking!

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,190
T-Series needs only 2 million su- oh no. amnesia, pewdiepie, come on

88
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,380
nothing is working

89
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,380
it's so obvious that T-Series is gonna take over no matter what, so I might as well meme it

90
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,600
i don't know why people find it so weird. I get people asking me privately like, so like what do you actually think about it?

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,340
i'm like, what do you think? like, what do you think?

92
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,580
stop asking me questions- I'm gonna KILL THEM

93
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,300
i'm a sociopath and we live in a society. do sociopaths breathe?

94
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,580
yes

95
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,620
i just got the chills

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,030
how to always be monetized. step 1

97
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,200
copyright the T-Series diss track. that can easily be done. put the song in every video, maybe in the endcard

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,740
that's a good idea. copystrike yourself

99
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,310
oh my god, copystrike yourself . how could i be so blind? that's genius. it was so obvious all along

100
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:13,600
I just need to copystrike myself. well as silly as it sounds it's actually 100% possible

101
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,520
YouTube system is so easily exploitable at this point, you know, there are laws to protect reviews and uh

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,940
and references and you're allowed to show them. YouTube is responsible for what is on their website

103
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,200
so the easiest action for them is just to delete or give the revenue to the copyright claimer

104
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,060
and uh, it's a shame. it makes it such a mess. sharing stuff is such a-

105
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,080
you know what, I don't need to get in a preachy thing (???)

106
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,410
my point. let's just backtrack all of that

107
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,700
if I did this another claim could still come in and we would have to split it

108
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,580
but at least I would get half instead of nothing for using like a two second clip or whatever

109
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,580
all the other lyrics in the diss track

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,200
bah lasagna

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,460
that's the real intellectual line, okay, people don't understand it

112
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,460
if you think it's a stupid line, you don't get it. also notice how I kept going like this in the video. that's right

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,020
i didn't realize how much I was pointing until after where I review the footage and once you see it

114
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,360
you can't unsee it. for some reason doing this felt very natural for me at the time, okay, stop judging me

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:34,920
uploading the felix wheezing compilation again because it never made it- oh wait what

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,120
that's why pewdiepie should never shave

117
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,880
I need to shave like this distance is not good. maybe if I have it like that it's alright

118
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,500
but whatever I got going now, it's not good

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,180
see felix it's not that hard

120
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,200
imagine if i actually-

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,880
that's the best use of greenscreen I have seen in my life

122
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,740
i can't diss pewdiepie. he is unbeatable

123
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,440
well finally, real recognizes real, thank you, thank you eminem. very good

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,380
eating the picture. waiting for the subreddit to make a bunch of memes of the kid for the free-

125
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,420
felix. the child

126
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,340
eat the picture

127
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,380
eat the kid

128
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,100
sorry, felix this meme is locked. it'll unlock automatically if the kid is eat- oh my god. alright fine

129
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,340
can we get some uhh

130
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,180
i need the right music for this

131
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:44,300
here we go

132
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:55,230
he's done this for 100 days

133
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:11,120
i'm gonna swallow it

134
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,100
i'm such a health nerd

135
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,040
i'm already like, am i gonna die?

136
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,120
you know, of all the sightings concerning me (???) and it's a different story

137
00:09:25,120 --> 00:10:02,440
this kid's have done 100 days, and i'm like, oh am i gonna die views?

138
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,140
alright, no more of this stuff. no more challenges. if I see one I'm ignoring it, okay

139
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,400
it was a fun meme for what it was and face lampshade

140
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,420
very well done. good job. you did it. congratulations

141
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,610
i'm glad no one died. that's uh, that's all I appreciate right now. thanks for watching

142
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,500
we added a t-shirt of meme review, a lot of people have been saying

143
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,130
they want a t-shirt version and it's cheaper

144
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:35,820
so if you want to get merch a little cheaper version we have that now as well. we also have phone cases added

145
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,920
how about that? that's great. no one seems to buy this one. it's so cool. i don't know why. alright

146
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,920
well, either way, I appreciate all the support on this. it's doing really well. i'm very happy that you guys like it and
