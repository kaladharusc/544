00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,200
Were you just in my closet?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,100

Well, it's just we have to mute you on facebook.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,780
Wait why?

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,540
You're gonna be posting about it every day like excessively

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,960
We literally won't be able to hear about anything else.       - It's just gonna be too damn annoying

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,880
You'll basically become a cancer on our timeline slowly replacing all the fun posts we see with boring ones

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,020
You understand

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,500
I can't believe our own friends would do this to us. - I'm sorry, do you guys hear something? - No.-  Ok that's what I thought

23
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,820
I mean, that's so tough. But you're a great person. I know you'll find some way. - Hey you guys guess what I did today

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,540
