1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,600
don't puff up at me like a bird

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,240
here's a Piazza that's how babies moved

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,590
on

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,750
sorry to interrupt everyone's national

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,960
Shane Dawson finale series day but you

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
know we're making the videos time is now

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,470
so there's been a trend on YouTube

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,019
recently where people just listen to the

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,119
audio of a makeup tutorial or like if

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,099
you're simply no logical Christine you

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,990
listen to the audio of a nail tutorial

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,240
and try and recreate them and then Jessi

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,250
smiles the other day took you to a whole

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,050
other level when she had her husband

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,210
listened and watched a tutorial and then

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,640
just tell her what to do and they have a

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,230
little bit of a language barrier we do

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,510
not but you know that's debatable

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,969
but I think this really just boils down

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,030
to how bad are you at communication with

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,980
your significant other which is always a

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,530
fun time so I do not know yeah Anthony

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,480

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,699

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,170

58
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,590
full coverage and you're gonna tap it on

59
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,629
up and down do you have any colour-pop

60

61
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,879
around that okay I don't have all the

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,010
brands that whoever this person is is

63
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,540
gonna have alright I'm just like a

64
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,430
normal person I don't just have like

65
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,290
doodles of makeup sitting around you

66
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,549
know I'm saying what's your favorite

67
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:36,940
keyboard shortcut that's best cuz

68
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,799
sometimes you just go paste after not

69
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:39,940
being at your computer for a while

70
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,640
[Laughter]

71
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,299
how am I looking

72
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,849
you look good am i following it so yeah

73
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,620
you're doing this is the foundation so

74
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,239
you're almost done I think right next

75
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,799
you're gonna get some concealer you want

76
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,599
to neutralize and brighten up the shadow

77
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,819
parts of your face are you high and then

78
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,340
you're gonna blend them that's it those

79
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,989
are the only places yeah as far as I

80
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,819
know after this you're gonna quickly set

81
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,940
your under eyes using powder here

82
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,720
yeah

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,630
goes on perfect yeah just like that only

84
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,160
on eyes with the bright stuff you're

85
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,900
doing good I feel like I'm getting an

86
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,510
idea of who's tutorial this is give a

87
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,040
gasp do and I guess enough yeah but you

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,959
can't confirm down we'll just keep it

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,940
straight fast I feel like this might be

90
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,829
someone whose name rhymes with Mickey

91
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:26,230
memorials so now you're gonna do your

92
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,180
brows off-camera I don't know that's

93
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,720
expecting though can you give me an idea

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,079
of like a general yeah like are they

95
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,630
dark are they heavy are they thick like

96
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,970
okay let me achieve the lugger they're

97
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,329
like cut very fine edge is pretty thick

98
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,200
yeah like a dark brown dark brown not

99
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,940
black a little bit longer towards the

100
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,010
edge yeah I know the outside isn't done

101
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm saying the insides can I just do it

102
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,599
no I have a better idea it doesn't

103
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,860
matter that you've seen it and I

104
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,950
it's gonna have to use your words and

105
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,530
describe them okay so just your right

106
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,570
brow has the perfect thickness it just

107
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,880
needs to extend further out it's not

108
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,450
done yet

109
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,190
but I'm telling you that's what you need

110
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,840
to do I know it's not done that's why

111
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,810
I'm giving you my shape yes just keep

112
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,530
those edges clean so the inner part of

113
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,930
that eyebrow the line is going up we'll

114
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,090
make the line go that way in yeah a

115
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,350
little bit just a little bit like that

116
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,570
yeah that's much better perfect just do

117
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,040
that on both eyebrows you told me to

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,030
make them face in yeah yeah no it's good

119
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,750
a little more hairy but maybe yeah

120
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,790
you're being a little unclear so I'm

121
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,630
just gonna do this and call it a day cuz

122
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,890
that's perfect do that on both sides so

123
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,720
kind of just a sharp edge the same like

124
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,910
I get it but sharp isn't a description

125
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,900
of length or direction okay so the right

126
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,070
one is good the left four needs

127
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,090
sharpening this is like imagine all the

128
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,500
work you be getting done if you didn't

129
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,530
yell at me right now is this a precise

130
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,000
blending brush so well take it slow pop

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,410
open the color palette give it a nice

132
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:16,100
pop we know you're right for the yellow

133
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,470
although her heels a bit more lemony

134
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,720
okay let me see what else I have isn't

135
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,330
like a solid mat yellow yes it's like a

136
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,120
solid sunflower yellow borderline orange

137
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,070
so I'm thinking if you mix those two it

138
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,910
would be perfect

139
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,640
mix this one uh-huh but they're both

140
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,140
shimmery I don't have anything matte

141
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,210
like it doesn't need any that where do I

142
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,710
put it on my so you're going on the

143
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,530
inside like the cou the inner thinners

144
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,440
the inner this right in there yeah they

145
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,890
go under my eye at all yes a payoff and

146
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,140
then it goes like around but not all the

147
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,330
way so let's start with the with the

148
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,940
green soft circular motions this is

149
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,100
gonna come out kinda orange that's fine

150
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,080
not yellow at all oh well it's supposed

151
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,230
to be yellow like you

152
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,120
Louis or so if it's just straight orange

153
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,370
then it's the wrong color I told you

154
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,810
what color is that these really only

155
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,890
colors yeah yeah that but like brighter

156
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,120
maybe just go with that but that's not

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,890
yellow at all that's orange no but what

158
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,790
you have on your face is not right what

159
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,490
about this isn't right yeah they're

160
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,030
brighter uh-huh we get that but you told

161
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,740
me to mix these two colors together they

162
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,450
didn't turn out and now you're up it

163
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,400
just doesn't look right and you blame me

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,810
not blaming anybody I'm just making

165
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,760
observations it doesn't look right so is

166
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,430
it more yellow it's brighter and less of

167
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,040
like a Dungy dark color really coming

168
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,290
hot Dungy because we're mixing orange

169
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,090
and greens some I thought you don't have

170
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,010
any yellow color Palace just cake on

171
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,660
some orange to call it a day are you

172
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,420
sure this is right misty no it's not but

173
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,370
for what we have it's the best wait but

174
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,230
like the placement likes the placements

175
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,330
right yes yeah except it goes a little

176
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,490
more on top so if you can imagine a lion

177
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,470
in the center of your eyelid go to that

178
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,030
half point yeah but is it like really

179
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,940
all the way to like my nose no it's like

180
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,260
to the it's like to the bridge shape you

181
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:08,040
have a perfect in there you do your

182
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,740
makeup in here it doesn't go like into

183
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,510
Europe is it just the tear duct

184
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,910
no it's a little bit past just the tear

185
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,100
but okay good no meter or two outside

186
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,600
the tuna can i before you keep going

187
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,790
it's not a hard cut you want it like

188
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,190
fade it a little more on top so will I

189
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,580
just started okay but can I just explain

190
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,650
okay so if I were to do the shadow I'm

191
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,480
not gonna do it on the top eyelid and

192
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,490
just stop in a hard line it's gonna

193
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,640
blend so the top is longer it's like

194
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,500
more towards the edge than the bottom so

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
it's like more of like a diagonal

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,190
faint so you want me to put the shadow

197
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,160
from here into my crease but not on my

198
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,410
lid this whole thing is a lid

199
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,450
this is the crease yes you're gonna so

200
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,600
the top is gonna no no no no words like

201
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:59,310
tough use lid crease brow the top no the

202
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,660
top part of that color no no no no give

203
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:03,920
me

204
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:11,140
anatomy lid crease crown no top apart

205
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,210
the top part let me get there of the

206
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,190
color will reach the crease while the

207
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,020
bottom part stays on the lid at a

208
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,210
diagonal angle so the top is on the

209
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,260
crease but if you were to go straight

210
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,510
down it's not it's not calling on that

211
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,040
part of the ladder can you look here

212
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,960
right actually listen to what she says

213

218
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,600
eyelid uh-huh it's like a straight line

219
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,430
where it stops yes so you're just gonna

220
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,790
angle that line yes it goes like into my

221
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,750
crease yes but only on the top yes like

222
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,800
this Julian yes well uh but that's too

223
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,610
far

224
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,420
this is so hard okay wait show

225
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,670
your eye thank you that's good that's

226
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,510
good that's good

227
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,940
you want to leave a little space in the

228
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,950
middle of the eyelid and just go towards

229
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,000
the edge because we're gonna put another

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,880
color in the middle after so from here

231
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,590
yeah are you talking like the outer

232
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,410
corner yes so the eye yes exactly and

233
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,040
it's gonna go out come up so far

234
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,150
basically gonna meet your eyebrow it's

235
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,310
so this color the bright pink is gonna

236
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,360
run parallel to your eyebrow so like

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,850
here to here yes but also but like a

238
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,260
little more on top of the lid on the

239
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,170
outer does it go to here yep and then

240
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,370
down yes was that so hard he does and

241
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,900
you want to touch the bottom corner that

242
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,290
lid

243
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,250
oh it's perfect so brighter how blended

244
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,850
is it

245
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,920
well not fully blended yet because

246
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
there's gonna be a color meeting in the

247
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,530
middle that blends all of it together

248
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,270
we're gonna cut the lid now mm-hmm

249
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,910
do you know that is this part or you cut

250
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,630
the crease

251
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,210
yeah so your whole lid crease becomes

252
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,470
like pea Louise basis so whatever a base

253
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,870
like a break does it look like concealer

254
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,750
yes it's like white it's like what yeah

255
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,420
and you're gonna like tap it on so

256
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,130
and blend color you're not cutting the

257
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,380
whole lid you're going about just over

258
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,700
halfway and it's gonna be like a

259
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,080
windshield wiper it's gonna stop like

260
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,580
right there and then you can blend it

261
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,290
with a pink on the outside to make that

262
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,180
pink and white line go away you're gonna

263
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,850
use the orange to blend the two even

264
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,710
more so it's like a pink orange wet

265
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,810
that's looking good it's looking really

266
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,790
good can you trim the top of it a little

267
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,290
bit just a little bit like that is that

268
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,010
a little better

269
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,530
it looks great kasi wonderful so

270
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,670
you're gonna go to the bottom crease a

271
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,780
little bit you're gonna start towards

272
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,800
the other than you see if she goes all

273
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,060
the way towards the middle so it's gonna

274
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,440
go when you're in the middle you can go

275
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,270
to Orange I'm gonna meet it at the other

276
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,310
side but it's gonna be very think about

277
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,410
that thick on the bottom so not merely a

278
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,600
stick on the as it is on the alternative

279
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,120
oh it's half pink half orange and you're

280
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,510
just gonna blend the transition colors

281
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,640
basically right here it's it spreads out

282
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,660
a little too far out of your face so

283
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,010
maybe you just cleaned up on me it just

284
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,170
means that a little bit to be fair

285
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,240
though when I asked you before if that

286
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,370
was right you said it was yeah I'm sorry

287
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm learning my makeup terms okay is it

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,390
more like that perfect that's exactly

289
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,070
how this look this is kind of hard

290
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,600
because she only reveals this at the

291
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,850
very end she said to leave a sliver of

292
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,550
skin on the inside corner right here to

293
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,600
put white liner is it liquid liner that

294
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,480
is it in the inside nose it just it's

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,460
not a it's not on the one oh okay so but

296
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,890
it makes a V with this like that and

297
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,900
then kind of blend into the white spot I

298
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,940
only have a white pencil is that gonna

299
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,110
work got a PI work

300
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,820
oh my god we're getting that how this is

301
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,860
looking so good that looks so good that

302
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,260
looks so good that's exactly student

303
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,990
Steel ago bronze bronze belt ha

304
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,790
so what you're gonna do is you're

305
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,850
basically gonna define the line the top

306
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,820
line of the white meeting the orange on

307
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,530
the inside so that I'm gonna use it as

308
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,180
an eyeliner it's just gonna be like one

309
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,580
line till when the color meets the white

310
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,320
coat on you're splitting the here's a

311
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,930
lot in the crease yes the waterline it

312
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,520
doesn't go all the way to the orc

313
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,470
yeah there's no pastor call

314
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,720
goes to when the white snow more than

315
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,820
the white snow morning yes nothing yep a

316
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,710
little further it's a little bit further

317
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,980
perfect literally perfect now so the

318
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,900
next step is you're gonna do in her

319
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,500
words a thick black cat called cat -

320
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,480
wait wait wait wait one way does it does

321
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,550
it go on this right yes but not all the

322
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,870
way towards the it starts like right

323
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,520
here towards the middle and then goes

324
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,140
all the way out so you want it to start

325
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,720

333
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,000

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,890

336
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,330
listen I'm gonna be honest here I will

337
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,630
say that her blending is very good and

338
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,850
yours isn't there on this look because

339
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,260
you're not watching this tutorial but

340
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,950
you're doing a close second thing beads

341
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,910
now get the scare on I thought after

342
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,530
this it was just lipstick and we're done

343
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,330
but there's like five other ten other

344
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,270
steps that I don't know what and bottoms

345
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,490
kara - okay did you know that there's a

346
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,850
first syllable - we run called Matt

347
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,710
knows kara it's you're scary it's not

348
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,760
mascara okay now you're gonna bronze

349
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,520
your cheekbones my cheekbones yeah your

350
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,380
upper cheekbones right here she bronzes

351
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,330
right here does she contour no bronze

352
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,550
with a brush is good and then she does

353
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,810
contour okay

354
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,750
so first from my cheekbones oh she says

355
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,290
she contours her nose off camera is it

356
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,180
like a James Charles level of nose

357
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,770
contour it's pretty contoured

358
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,690
so now what we're gonna do is we're

359
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,350
gonna take a blush trio do the blush you

360
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,400
know bitch

361
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,680
so it's like a peach yeah yeah more on

362
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,180
the upper side yeah I like up that good

363
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,320
what color highlighter

364
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,670
she's the color called

365
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,040
but it's like white none of these work

366
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,249
not even there these two together look

367
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:16,869
exactly like what she uses okay

368
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,699
side to side pop with the forehead just

369
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,379
very light but to make it a little bit

370
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,269
bright and classy just very layer

371
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,639
yeah just very light on both cheeks you

372
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,420
look stunning

373
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,550
hi men and I think she uses a nude

374
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,309
liquid lip kind of like a darker peach

375
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:33,519
that make sense so we go we gonna mix

376

377

382
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,540
makeup transformation by Nikki Satori I

383
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,579
know is the key tutorials show me her

384
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:03,819
look that is okay you know you did good

385
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:13,959
Oh bitch this is not feel like you

386
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,549
didn't have a yellow what am I supposed

387
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,319
to do you know honestly this might have

388
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,089
been the best that we could get for that

389
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,249
effect of like transitioning but all

390
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,009
bitch you did the eyes perfectly just

391
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:25,629
didn't have the right palette like Oh

392
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:30,519
vids oh okay so she did leave a big

393
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,829
space in there yeah that was so hard to

394
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:33,279
describe

395
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,619
yeah I understand why that's hard to

396
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,839
describe we only used two colors when we

397
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,399
have two colors out of all the workers

398
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,860
I've done like a different lighter color

399
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,110
yes no it would have looked too

400
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,329
different honestly you this was so

401
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:48,999
frustrating - listen you described this

402
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:51,670
to me but like we got the gist of the

403
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,079
look I think so

404
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,730
I think we got like the idea of it Oh

405
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,490
for fuck's sake why'd you do this to

406
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,629
yourself why would you pick this

407
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,639
tutorial I don't know I just picked an

408
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,009
exciting looking face oh she did a

409
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,529
glitter cut crease she did a cut

410
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,999
crease and then she did a glare cut

411
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,400
crease like oh bitch

412
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,650
would you do this to you no no now I

413
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,450
know what happens hard

414
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,100
technically you nail everything it was

415
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,540
just what the communication that got

416
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,710
 and the fact that we didn't have

417
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,240
to yell Oh cuz I think I'm explaining

418
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,550
something really clear but not only do I

419
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,320
not know make up terms are like what I'm

420
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,390
saying I also don't even know what she's

421

423
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,790

443
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,870
