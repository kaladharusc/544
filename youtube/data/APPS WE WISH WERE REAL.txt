1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,460
- You look so good in that pic!
Did you use Facetune?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,160
- No. Oh my god, it's so obvious
when people use that.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,200
I use Downgrade that makes everyone
else in the photo look 5% uglier.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,820
- Okay, that makes a lot more sense. I thought you were just friends with all the people with bad plastic surgery.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,940
- I am.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:28,480
- So I just was like, really dry. 
- That's not what your mom said last night.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,690
- Yeah? Well, your mom has a massive thyroid issue that negatively affects her health.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,000
also,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,360
her bones are soft because she has a calcium deficiency. And her wheelchair smells which is probably why her husband

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,780
parenthesis, your dad left.

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,480
Assh*le.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,420
- Jesus Christ, man.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,240
- Hey Ian!
- Yeah?

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,160
- Are you ever gonna post that
cute photo we took at NakedFootCon 2018?

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,800
- Oh, yeah, I ran it to that new app likely and estimated to only get like, 12 likes

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,480
- What?

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,880
Oh, yeah, so I'm just gonna post that same picture of my cat again.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,960
- Yeah, that's way better than our faces. 
- It's the only picture I see when I close my eyes.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,680
- Can't believe you said that.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,620
What, are y'all like in a trap it all?
- I've actually been listening to a lot of cloud rap.

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,700
- Yo, you know what?

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,330
I've actually been listening to a lot of Lil Uzi Vert!
- Lil' Uzi Vert is like, my favorite artist!

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,579
- Yeah, dude, XO to her life, a banger. I like the leather skirts, like everything that you're not supposed to wear as a rapper

24
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,350
Yeah, yeah, he's cool. What about you, Ian?

25
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,759
Lil Uzi Vert is an American cloud rap artist.

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,880
Cloud rap is a micro genre of hip-hop,

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,770
characterized by its hazy, lo-fi production.

28
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,480
Yeah. 
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,260
Yeah!

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,270
- That's what I have! 
I know. It's a serious follow away, okay, you ready to go?

31
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,520
I don't want to miss ground beef, happy hour at the mall! - Yes. I'm ready.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,130
But can we not walk by the library? There are a bunch of hornies that hang out there. 
- Yes, I know. Okay

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,450
So this time I got us this app

34
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,680
It's called Catcaller Maps, and will show us where all the cat callers are and we can just avoid them.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,300
And the sex offenders.

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,460
And the murderers. 
- Oh my god.

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:32,690
- Should we just stay at home, forever? 
- Uh-huh, this is so many! 
I'm worried.

38
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,330
Hey, man.

39
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,060
I just want to say thank you so much for that text last night.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,930
It was so eloquent and beautiful and really pulled me out of a slump.

41
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,690
I was blacked out last night,

42
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,840
... so I probably drunk texted you. 
- Really? 
- Yeah.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,280
- 'Cause you said: Ian your constant steadfast friendship has been like a life vest in this vast ocean

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,960
storm keeping me afloat through perilous waters.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:07,720
- Oh, I used Boozo Lingo! What I actually texted you was: Hombo, u r teh best.

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,820
I fuging luv u, you are a life vest.

47
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:20,480
Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,340
- What is a fff- what is it?

49
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,400
- That is 36 letter F's in a row.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Tequila's crazy! 
- Uh-huh.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,030
- Okay.
We can ask her out?

52
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,600
- Well, I think she's cute and all but how am I supposed to know if she's crazy or not?

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,360
- Oh, just use a red flag app it'll literally highlight all of her replies.
- Of course.

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,590
Damn. Oh, she lives in her car?
She used to have a daughter?

55
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,840
And she already said she loves me? 
- Wow, you dodged a bullet.

56
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,920
- I think I can fix her. 
- No.
 Oh, you know, you're right. You're right. You're right

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,280
- I can fix her.

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,709
- Hey, you've been looking really good lately. Like, super fit! Are you using that app,  My Fitness Pal?

59
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,120
- No, I've actually gotten into this new body shaming app.
- Oh, what's it called?

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,060
- Instagram.

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,720
- Makes sense.
