1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,700
is the Peugeot sees the beach had you'll

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,350
miss so a lot of people have been

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,480
requesting this video

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
exactly it honestly makes so much sense

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,550
for today because Judaism in an ending

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,950
cave for like days because he has a

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,990
series called last-minute trips so he's

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,390
just been slaving away and I wanted to

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,660
do something really nice for him just

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,859
give him the hair that he deserves I've

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,080
dyed hair extensions and put them in my

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,060
hair they were tapings but I've never

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,579
dyed clip-in extensions and then put

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,880
them on like a short buzz cut and I am

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,710
ready for a challenge I hope you don't

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,629
mind just hanging out with me today for

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,129
a little bit because it's just like one

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,899
of those days I'm like desperately

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,640
trying to get Julian to pay attention to

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,980
me but like he's very busy right now

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,840
nothing says pay attention to me quite

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,210
like dyeing him some bright yellow hair

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,219
extensions and then demanding that he

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,690
let me put them in his head my right

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,020
legs the minute my non-binary friend I

26
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,520
mean I'm not gonna do it the right way

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,039
I'm gonna do it how I want to do it but

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,549
in this house we do what we want so when

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,170
I was at the beauty supply store a girl

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,510
named Kat arendelle I met her in line

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,430
she's a makeup artist and she literally

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,990
was like let me give you my discount

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,820
code for this store cuz I'm a makeup

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,150
artist in this economy she saved me $60

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,610
so like a thank you you were an angel

36
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,439
sent from heaven the way that I did this

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,180
last time and according to a lot of

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,369
YouTube videos is you just like you

39
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,890
paint them like the hair but I don't

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,180
feel like doing that today I feel like

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,759
doing something a little bit more

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,530
tactile you know what I'm saying so I'm

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,090
gonna put them in a bowl cover it and

44
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,970
dye it squish it up here it is I've

45
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,829
already abused it a little bit by taking

46
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,630
it out of its package you know I was

47
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,369
real rough with it but like welcome to

48
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,290
the world bitch when I look this up I

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,149
didn't know that you could get these

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,890
little clips into like really short hair

51
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,590
but the women and men of YouTube have

52
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,590
proved me wrong it is amazing that they

53
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,210
can clip them into like really short

54
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,219
hair it looks really good

55
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,869
so I have high hopes that this is gonna

56
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,030
work I know you guys do too for those of

57
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,530
you that have been requesting this and

58
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,270
although I wish that this could be like

59
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,710
a full genna's ratchet salon video or

60
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,360

61
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,630
of nice to just hang out and have this

62
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,750
soothing relaxing craft experience on

63
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,330
this humans hair that I don't know where

64
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,890
they are and who they are and where they

65
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,020
came from but like thank you for eating

66
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,150
a diet full of like really nutritious

67
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,680
things and growing all this hair because

68
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,660
I can't grow it myself and cut it off if

69
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,480
you're a hairdresser look away because

70
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,860
I'm gonna piss you off

71
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,220
oh it's like hair mustard I think it's

72
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,780
like a really thoughtful thing to do for

73
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,970
someone's to make them some hair I first

74
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,680
see problems I guess there's a reason

75
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,770
why people don't do this oh this is

76
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,690
clearly not a good plan but I'm also

77
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,340
like kind of lazy just want to do the

78
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,110
fun parts without any of the like the

79
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,420
meticulous work parts someone else's

80
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,130
hair and it's not even on a head just

81
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,260
cover it in mustard and call it a day

82
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,940
I think this looks right if anything

83
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,860
comes out uneven honestly it's not my

84
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,250
fault

85
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,870
it's the hares fault I'm not doing

86
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,120
anything Julian really deserves some

87
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,150
beautiful long luscious hair because

88
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,950
he's a really good man and he doesn't

89
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,080
judge me which is honestly all into the

90
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,840
back imagine your real stress you got a

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
big presentation coming up at work here

92
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,740
comes your girlfriend from the other

93
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,990
room with a pile of beautifully colored

94
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,000
hair and says give me that head bitch

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm here to meet your dreams come true

96
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,250
color saturation is great why would I

97
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,990
sit around paint a thousand hair

98
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,600
extensions if I see any blonde parts I'm

99
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,850
gonna be pissed because this method that

100
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm using is impeccable

101
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,930
perfect amazing like I think that I

102
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,760
nailed that so I'm just gonna leave this

103
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,620
here for a little bit and then I'll wash

104
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,230
them out shampoo condition them and then

105
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,210
I'll probably blow dry em and shit it's

106
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,590
gonna take a while but it's gonna be

107
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,280
worth it

108
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,740
because Julian is gonna look like he

109
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,550
deserves

110
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,080
oh hello is it a mess yes but does it

160
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:52,249
the illusion is there because it's

161
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,559
exactly the same color but like this is

162
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,899
you can just clip these in and go you

163
