44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,340
few is the volume good volume good

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,870
volume okay if you're watching this in

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,730
the future don't be confused I just

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,230
decided to livestream this one because I

48
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,030
wanted to give it a good try I did one

49
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,290
video a while back when they were

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,489
certainly in development but now I

51
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,450
wanted to play it again so yeah good

52
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,489
yeah when does it come out this game has

53
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,900
already come out so if you want to play

54
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,280
this you can play it right now I don't

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
know what specifically it came out but

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,390
yeah the game is good yeah volumes good

57
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,100
so I don't know what to expect because

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,810
last time that I played this it was just

59
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,060
kind of an early intro to it you got the

60
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,800
concepts of the game and it's gonna be

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,970
interesting to see how much has changed

62
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,280
since it actually came out a long time

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,080
ago or when it first got released as a

64
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,150
demo a long time ago and now that it's

65
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,709
in its full release

66
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,050
welcome ace Timon thank you so much yeah

67
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,920

69
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,370
much for being here on this one we're

70
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,780
gonna have fun today maybe

71
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,740
I don't know if we're gonna be happy

72
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,150
unless the happiness is actually all

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,160
fake and it's not really about happiness

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,240
and it's about something much more

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
sinister which would probably be the

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,910
case but let's do this

77
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,010
new game everybody buckle up Oh easy

78
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,730
whoa custom Oh easy you're here for a

79
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,500
story or two to explore strange new

80
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,060
world people will be less suspicious of

81
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,080
you and you will be getting plenty of

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,490
warning before they become a regressive

83
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,650
you enjoy a challenge people will be

84
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,910
suspicious of you and you'll need to

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,830
learn the rules to blend in you enjoy a

86
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,180
good fight in a harsh world where

87
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,889
survival is not guaranteed satisfying

88
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,090
your basic needs will take more effort

89
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,530
and time and people will generally be

90
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,320
hostile why would they be hostile in

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,640
this lovely beautiful world why would

92
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,130
they be hostile let's just go with

93
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,840
normal because I have no idea what else

94
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:58,510
do begin not yet begin probably happy

95
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,580
people have no past but that seems odd I

96
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,630
don't know

97
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:23,250

swimming in the river so I don't know

103
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,250
much about the story of this game so I

104
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,969
have no idea

105
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,349
hasting brothers win scrap gathering but

cannot illuminates the regulation any

261
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,740
further because Colonel von Stauffenberg

262
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,110

I'm sorry but I'm not stopping

266
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,890

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:36,649
suggest how to best rearrange the

322
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:37,850
department I am always grateful for

323
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,230
suggestions from junior staff without a

324
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,419
best to do my job as director however I

325
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:42,500
am afraid that it would be just

326
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,299
destabilizing to swap your office with

327
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,980
that of mr. Hastings fortunately

328
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,570
turnover in this department is high if

329
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,190
Prue doesn't return soon I don't see why

330
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,600

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,990
[Music]

533
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,300
off his joy perhaps he merely forgot you

534
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,710
always you've got to look after your

535
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,970
mates man have you tried to tying a

536
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,050
string around his finger that always

537
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,030
helps me anyway I can't resign Teddy

538
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,410
because I haven't got a replacement on

539
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,970
all the juniors are offs Cargill the

540
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,040
substance has been severing all sorts of

541
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:31,700
connections the mo Deline must flow okay

542
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,980
but tire swing around the figure all

543
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,960
right sure prudence Holmes was this a

544
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,550
mistake it seems so clever to disappear

545
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,990
first rather than trying to brazen my

546
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,090
way across the bridge after enough joy

547
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,710
they'd forget they'd ever known the

548
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,750
prudence Holmes beastly Clive would take

549
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,370
my office and they'd forget anyone else

550
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,930
was ever in it but now that I'm here I

551
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,640
wonder should I have put my trust in mr.

552
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,440
kite and where are his bloody

553
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,190
instructions in the abandoned house yes

554
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,780
but which abandon house they're all

555
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,190
abandoned how to deal with all these

556
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,900
wastrels my god they look like something

557
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,640
out of Dante we'd chase someone out

558
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,990
whenever they'd make they wouldn't take

559
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,160
their joy but we never really thought

560
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,200
about where they went when I knew we

561
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,700
chased them out when joy made them sick

562
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,530
but I didn't know it was here to starve

563
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,150
and weep and remember I assumed they

564
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,800
were all sent to the sanatorium a decent

565
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,060
hospital but I suppose that's what I

566
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,010
wanted to believe we were all complicit

567
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,290
we know without knowing and don't want

568
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,080
to remember so we don't let her live

569
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,640
terrible handwriting dear doctor

570
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320

571
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
is a subversive and maybe even a downer

572
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,820
I overheard him in the commissary

573
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,380
telling a friend that he thinks that his

574
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,210
job redacting old articles is silly and

575
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,570
what's

576
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,159
scary about the truth he's a very tall

577
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,019
and slim with black hair and brown eyes

578
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,029
and glasses I know I shouldn't should

579
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,440
have asked his name but I am a naturally

580
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,870

00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:48,130
I must vigorously disagree with the

1141
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,570
recent editorial regard individual and

1142
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,220
the actions against the saboteurs these

1143
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,350
selfish parents attempted to destroy the

1144
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:54,880
registry of children so that their own

1145
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,560
would not have to be hostages their

1146
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,910
actions were a slap in the face of every

1147
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,710
family that has a send a son off to war

1148
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:01,570
we must all do our duty by long English

1149
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,100
tradition cowards are hanged to

1150
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,020
encourage the others surely saboteur

1151
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,360
cowers deserve no better all right miss

1152
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,780
Bing we've heard a lot about Miss Bing

1153
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,030
yeah saboteurs swing justice or mob

1154
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,340
violence in a good question I guess they

1155
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:35,410
were so small oh that's terribly

1156
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:38,290
romantic isn't it I had each other until

1157
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:43,150
the end for what Oh

01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:48,410
[Music]

1159
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:53,310
hmm okay all right yeah I'm guessing

1160
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,320
that what they remember is something

1161
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,990
about like something that happened to

1162
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,450
the children of this town like something

1163
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,340
about the children so that they couldn't

1164
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,170
like they couldn't deal with the pain

1165
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,640
that must have been killing children

1166
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,780
that that's the only thing that it could

1167
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,220
have been right thanks to a bit of

1168
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,869
British ingenuity the Bell pit brothers

1169
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:11,400

01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:28,470

1947
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:07,240
edible things cook together then left to

alright here we go

1951
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,550
no no no that's very valuable I

1952
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:22,180
shouldn't have eaten that oh there you

1953
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:22,780
go

1954
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:24,670
okay here we go all right let's try this

1955
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,110
again

1956
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:32,740
oh wait whump whump whump whump listen

1957
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:35,830
that sounds like it hurts a lot I always

1958
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:38,490
see Jovan and sin heaven in the system

1959
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:44,860
what Wow listen I'm not a murderer it

1960
01:44:44,860 --> 01:45:11,920
was just a branch this is a branch I

1961
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,260
made I am hitting him in the brain a lot

1962
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,480
so maybe that has something to do with

1963
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,830
it but I wouldn't think that a branch

1964
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:19,390
would be able to just kill someone

1965
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:23,440
outright all the games and media

1966
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,810
oftentimes overplay the ability to just

1967
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,490
knock someone unconscious without any

1968
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:28,480
consequences

1969
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,670
usually that ends up with doing some

1970
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:34,120
serious damage to their future prospects

1971
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:37,930
at being able to use their brain yeah so

1972
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:40,600
that's pretty much not it's not murder

1973
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,610
yeah yeah probably not I don't know

1974

2046
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:41,890
stick don't pay attention to the stick

2047
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:44,200
when unlocking trackside door always do

2048
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,320

2049

yeah I do buku always do be careful okay

2050

sure whatever you say buddy always do be

2051
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:02,700

2052
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:11,160
what did I just do always do be careful

2053
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,400
whoa where did that shudder go there is

2054
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,050
a vent above the door there's no place

2055
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:19,330
for that shudder to go that didn't make

2056
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:24,040
any sense whatsoever okay all right yeah

2057
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,990
sure whatever I'll let it slide for now

2058
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:32,520
but you're on thin ice

2059
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:46,980
oh oh I'm sorry Percy I should have got

2060
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:49,070
on the train with you like I promised

2061
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:52,140
the rule was if a kid was a day over 13

2062
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:55,380
what could I do you could have kept your

2063
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:57,000
mouth shut off there are not told them

2064
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,350
you were 13 that's what you could have

2065
01:50:58,350 --> 01:51:01,320
done

2066
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:05,210
I suppose yeah

2067
01:51:05,210 --> 01:51:07,410
now why would there still be coins in

2068
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:07,860
that thing

2069
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:09,450
I guess if nobody came around to collect

2070
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:12,360
them but hey even so doesn't seem

2071
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,930
logical

2072
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:17,640
it is a sad story that they got going on

2073
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:23,100
here yeah brothers separate but what's

2074
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:24,600
weird about is in the inventory screen

2075
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,370
when you can see that this is from

2076
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:27,990
Arthur's perspective it makes it seem

2077
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:29,850
like there's more going on here than you

2078
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,730
would you know ordinarily see for coin

2079
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:36,270
box give me your money I guess I can

2080
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:37,590
always make more Jamie bars if they keep

2081
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,930
breaking like that yes a lot of money

2082
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:41,760
that's a good bit of money

2083
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:47,730
good I'm it's weird like this game is

2084
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:49,860
kind of walking the line between a few

2085
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,140
different genres it's coming down like

2086
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,850
in the in the weird mystery of it but

2087
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:55,650
like the surreal nosov it is kind of

2088
01:51:55,650 --> 01:51:58,410
hiding a sad backstory like the the

2089
01:51:58,410 --> 01:52:00,240
happiness is to cover up so they don't

2090
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,820
they don't lose themselves in the sorrow

2091
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:04,890
of what happened and the loss of who

2092
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:07,230
they are sorry I gonna dog hair in my

2093
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:09,780
mouth yeah so it's kind of like I don't

2094
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,850
know it's just fascinating to see like

2095
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:13,560
the lengths that people will go to to

2096
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,470
try to forget like the sins of the past

2097
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:19,950
and and like maybe lose all hope like

2098
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:23,790
otherwise I don't know weird cool

2099
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:26,340
was weird can't wait to see more story

2100
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:29,350
about it though oh yeah I'm slow now

2101
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:33,019
[Music]

2102
01:52:33,019 --> 01:52:35,999
and you are too old to go to Germany are

2103
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:48,809
you glad eat Bobby I told him I wanted

2104
01:52:48,809 --> 01:52:50,550
to board even if I was ten days too old

2105
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:52,709
but we don't make the rules anymore mr.

2106
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:55,320
rice dings I shouldn't have told him

2107
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,110
they've got my birthday wrong don't even

2108
01:52:58,110 --> 01:53:00,179
know I did should have just kept quiet

2109
01:53:00,179 --> 01:53:04,309
and got on the train

2110
01:53:04,309 --> 01:53:07,530
wait so it makes it seem like it just by

2111
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:09,469
the sound of it it sounds like Percy's

2112
01:53:09,469 --> 01:53:11,669
older but that wouldn't make any sense

2113
01:53:11,669 --> 01:53:13,889
right you know I mean it doesn't make

2114
01:53:13,889 --> 01:53:15,840
any sense if that is the case which I

2115
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,550
don't think it is but you know this is

2116
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:20,610
bizarre I don't know the age is a little

2117
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:22,380
confusing because if Arthur was too old

2118
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:24,360
to get on there then that would make

2119
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,820
Percy younger right that's just what it

2120
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:32,159
would be Bobby he'll there's been some

2121
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:34,709
sort of Cavey so I'm sorry so much for

2122

02:11:22,030 --> 02:11:24,040
know why anyone would need a swing maybe

2444
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:25,720
the soldiers need some R&amp;R every once in

2445
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:34,000
a while hello okay is there no way in

2446
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,470

2447
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:40,750
do I want to go to the bunker his bunker

2448
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:43,500
where I want to go is that what I want I

2449
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:49,150
have no idea bunker I guess yes it feels

2450
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:51,280
like the game it feels like when they

2451
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,690
made this game they wanted it to be a

2452
02:11:52,690 --> 02:11:55,690
lot more open and not not linear but now

2453
02:11:55,690 --> 02:11:58,120
like you know now that it's out it feels

2454
02:11:58,120 --> 02:11:59,530
like very linear because it's a big

2455
02:11:59,530 --> 02:12:00,910
world there's a lot of space here and

2456
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:02,350
stuff like that and I feel like there's

2457
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:04,030
room to explore on a lot of stuff but it

2458
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:05,800
seems like it's very focused now but

2459
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,000
maybe I just haven't seen all the game

2460
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:17,380
yet you get down from that tree before I

2461
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:21,190
chop it down no the Germans love their

2462
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:23,710
list so they're taking us away on a

2463
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:27,640
train to Germany do you know about it

2464
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:28,540
don't you

2465
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:32,080
Oh told you that it's ridiculous oh you

2466
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:36,130
all know about it just not the kids look

2467
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:39,280
I've got cows they're so gonna be proud

2468
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,710
of milk they might even have chocolate

2469
02:12:41,710 --> 02:12:44,710
Oh chocolate makes it all better

2470
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:47,680
they've got tanks Arthur when you

2471
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:49,780
noticed how are we supposed to argue

2472
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:52,330
with tanks I don't want to go to Germany

2473
02:12:52,330 --> 02:12:56,050
it's only for a little while I think I

2474
02:12:56,050 --> 02:12:58,720
don't want to be a hostage calm down

2475
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:05,470
this have some tea oh I'll come down for

2476
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:09,790
tea only for tea though well that's fine

2477
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:17,870
I mean honestly

2478
02:13:17,870 --> 02:13:20,640
yeah honestly it's like probably like

2479
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:21,929
the kids that went to Germany probably

2480
02:13:21,929 --> 02:13:23,730
escaped to worse fate

2481
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:26,310
staying over here I mean I don't know

2482
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:27,690
that for certain maybe it's maybe it's

2483
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:28,890
horrible over there and maybe that's

2484
02:13:28,890 --> 02:13:30,630
absolutely awful maybe it's still part

2485
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:32,070
of the Holocaust and all that stuff but

2486
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,770
like it seems like what happened in this

2487
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:38,010
place like like the the the people in

2488
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:40,320
the UK they just they tore themselves

2489
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,330
apart trying to forget what they did but

2490
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:44,280
maybe I don't know maybe maybe it is

2491
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:45,750
terrible maybe that's why people are

2492
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:47,310
regretting everything like I don't know

2493
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:49,770
I have no idea maybe because people

2494
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:51,480
allowed it to happen like they didn't

2495
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:52,770
fight like that's why they hate

2496
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:55,170
themselves could be parting is such

2497
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:56,540
sweet sorrow

2498
02:13:56,540 --> 02:14:06,330
oh hello wonder why the Germans didn't

2499
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:07,739
take their tanks with them when they

2500
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:09,000
left I've made him up

2501
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,280
there's a hole in the fence inside the

2502
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,739
dump you just have to get in here get

2503
02:14:13,739 --> 02:14:17,160
the key and cut the power then sneak out

2504
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:20,640
into the darkness while I rub them blind

2505
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:24,540
easy peasy lemon squeezy how do I cut

2506
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:27,179
the power the general keeps the keys in

2507
02:14:27,179 --> 02:14:28,620
his desk do you want me to break into

2508
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:30,989

2512
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:40,590
have a lot of ammunition but they're

2513
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:46,679
terribly handy with their bayonets for

2514
02:14:46,679 --> 02:14:48,360
some of the famous hot buttered crumpets

2515
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:52,050
but I wouldn't recommend it they can't

2516
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:56,480
run very fast at all old farts like me

2517

02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:46,150
and if it doesn't then the fence in the
