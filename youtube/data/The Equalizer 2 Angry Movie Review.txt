Denzel Washington as Robert McCall this

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,980
sort of action hero who has a mysterious

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,350
pass and he has a certain set of skills

character gets him to come out of sort

15
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,090
of hiding in retirement and what not

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,500
really retirement they thought it was

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,390
dead and just to beat up a bunch of

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,800
people and it's awesome because

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,890
it's Denzel Washington and he's got this

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,410
vision mode where he goes in and breaks

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,140
everybody's neck and stabs and kills him

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,440
so uh what did you guys think let's just

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,300
get jump right in what did you guys

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,119
think of the sequel they were trying too

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,330
much with this one trying too hard yeah

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,970
huh okay could you elaborate the first

27
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,220
one it's like hey there's a bad guy he's

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,349
doing bad things time to up

29
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,539
and then he's doing it's down it was

30
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,759
great yeah this one they were trying to

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,090
do too much story and too much of like

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,240
trying to care for like other things

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,160
it's like hey you know what you are

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,660
you're a shoot-'em-up movie just

35
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,750
entertain me but you're trying too hard

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,179
it's difficult for me to you know and in

37
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,099
terms of criticism try to figure out

38
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,780
what trying too hard means what do you

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,640
think he means on it so sometimes with

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,330
these movies they your first one or like

41
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,440
especially when it's a new drug it's the

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,149
same director for this one but he had

43
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,039
actually pretty equalizer one was a

44
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,840
success like people really liked it and

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
it was kind of out of nowhere it was

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,580
weird

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,590
I mean Denzel a Dyson in LA dum-dum he's

48
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,050
like man on fire type movies before and

49
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,720
he didn't try to there wasn't a

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,160
complicated script like the plot was

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,270
pretty simple and things were pretty

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,760
good like it was really it was s yeah

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,480
bad guy go beat him up bad

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,050
I was a sort of medicine you know yeah

55
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,030
and a piece of gender underground

56
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,470
boss and here they they sort of have a

57
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,049
less menacing boss it's even if it's

58
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,659
less even if he is on par like there was

59
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,799
so much like talking about him trying to

60
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,840
come to peace with his wife dying of

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,370
which which happened you know years ago

62
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,140
but like there's a lot of like closure

63
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,000
like they want to have closure for this

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,390
visually not excited questions well yeah

65
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,610
yeah a little bit too many and so that

66
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,319
it really affects the pacing of the film

67
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,989
so I I will say I ond

68
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,720
twice in the film so that's not a good

69
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,019
thing

70
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,150
I never dawned in the original equalise

71
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,250
exam so that kind of tells you a little

72
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,440
bit of what you can expect I think the

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
the first act of very start starts off

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,299
good he's doing his thing he's doing the

75
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,970
whole room scanning and beating up some

76
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,239
random person in it on a train and you

77
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,579
know jumps are right into the action but

78
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,459
then it starts going off yes towards the

79
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,530
second half of the first act in the

80
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,069
second act completely and is really a

81
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,440
slow burn now the original was a slow

82
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,650
burn to a little bit um and it was

83
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,019
partly due to the directing style this

84
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,750
one has the same director but yeah this

85
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,630
one there's moments of it where you are

86
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,730
a little bit bored and you would really

87
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,010
just wish he gets to the point yeah

88
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,380
now that is mainly to set up these these

89
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,290
side characters and the side plots and

90
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,680
really only two of them matter he meets

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,599
up with characters from the previous

92
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,819
movie of Bill Pullman scare president a

93
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,690
United States and Susan who is this

94
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,389
basically as contact she gets Amalthea

95
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,209
Intel and information and jobs kind of

96
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,519
dead he's needing so there's a lot of

97
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,190
subplots going on and it almost feels

98
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,120
like they really didn't have a plan for

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,630
this one the first one was very was

100
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,060
successful yes way to do another one and

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,220
they kind of just threw darts there okay

102
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,050
what should we do let's get a little bit

103
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,729
of his backstory more of the backstory

104
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,950
but here it's inconsequential you don't

105
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,580
really learn a whole lot so all

106
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,650
time felt like spinning its wheels yeah

107
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,110
let's do some more with his eye you know

108
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,659
is crew okay yeah I guess that's a

109
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,789
natural progression but again that just

110
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:41,759
serves to sort of give us a new set up

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,430
and and that one's alright um and

112
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,550
overall I just feel like the the film

113
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,819
never captured of the the tension of the

114
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,280
original and that may be because

115
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,180
denzel's character he's like

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,729
invulnerable yeah like at no point do

117
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,819
you feel like he's going to get hurt you

118
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,870
know there's at one point he is being

119
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,280
he's in the most compromised position

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,159
right somebody's right mind you they're

121
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,229
going to attack you he's just an uber

122
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,960
driver right and he's got plan our Birds

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,770
I know what we did to see Denzel suffer

124
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,599
a little bit yeah so that we can feel

125
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,370
for him and we can be like is he gonna

126
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,930
make it out this time cuz he is getting

127
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,279
older remember in the first one at T's

128
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,849
always eight second slower oh my god in

129
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,520
this one he's ten seconds faster

130
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,639
remember his stopwatch was 26 seconds

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,159
instead of 30 he's to get better with

132
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,849
anybody so you see it lacks a little bit

133
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:44,330
of attention what else hmm

134
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,009
yeah trying to give away spoilers yeah

135
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,569
I'm yeah a lot of things when I want to

136
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,560
talk about other than spoilers section

137
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,460
next movie was not as bad as I thought

138
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,659
and this is something important to come

139
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,279
before the spoilers people like we came

140
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,219
in and the wrong tomato score is 30% yes

141
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,169
is not that bad and they've since come

142
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,430
come up quite a bit I think they're

143
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,839
sitting around 50 percent I think this

144
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,909
movie is average if not a little bit

145
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:06,599
above average

146
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,580
it's kind of been done before had this

147
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,289
movie come out ten years ago before we

148
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,330
got even the first equalizer and John

149
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,430
wick and John wick to where there's this

150
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,680
guy doing good things and there's bad

151
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,150
people and he's you know kind of

152
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,979
invulnerable this movie would have been

153
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,180
a little bit better but the bar has been

154
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,719
raised

155
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,250
like John would really raise the bar on

156
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,199
this stuff yeah John wick is a far more

157
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,479
entertaining series as a whole but even

158
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,969
the first equalizer is the superior yeah

159
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,770
and when he goes back to it you get

160
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,409
little flashes and glimpse of him back

161
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,270
in his element and it's fun to see these

162
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,580
new fight scenes but they're really few

163
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,620
and far between and they're the slow

164
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,470
burn like the

165
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,870
first one is but if the second slow-burn

166
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,330
doesn't engage you with its side plots

167
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,250
its characters and and the final boss

168
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,810
it's just a less of a movie it's

169
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,150
acceptable but it's just less of a movie

170
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,670
and I would probably save your money I'm

171
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,760
not sure you know if blind spawning is

172
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,940
out yet but it is it is shoot now I feel

173
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,960
like I wish we would have seen that

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,350
instead of this one so it may not be the

175
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,360
strongest one to go to the editors this

176
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,920
one if you're a big fan of the original

177
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,220
I almost say wait wait until it's out on

178
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,110
that flick I'm a big fan that would say

179
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,000
wait yeah and I go see I mean if you

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
want like a nonsense action movie then

181
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,920
this is fine mm-hmm so that is our quick

182
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,130
review of the equalizer and stick with

183
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,070
this if you want a spoiler section for

184
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,450
the film where we can kind of get into

185
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,010
debt what these guys are saying and

186
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,650
point out some of the plot holes or dumb

187
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,690
moments in this sort of climax does I

188
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,400
have some problems in the class okay

189
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,340
guys so let's get final verdicts or I'm

190
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,870
almost about to wrap up here let's get

191
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,150
final verdict final verdict I'm gonna go

192
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,550
with the five this was an average movie

193
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,190
the first one it captured like hey it's

194
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,169
a shoot-'em-up movie this is great

195
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,490
that's what I remember from the first

196
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,950
one amazing fight scene Denzel bean

197
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,610
great this one it was a big time lack in

198
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,490
between it really brought the movie down

199
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,410
for me what would you rather see Joe

200
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,720
skyscraper or equalizer oh I'd rather

201
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,630
see this one yeah me too I would rather

202
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,180
see equalizer - this was outputs in a

203
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,790
more memorable performance than than the

204
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,540
rock

205
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,380
I like Robert McCall his character more

206
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,780
than the character that Dwayne Johnson

207
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,760
played in skyscraper she's a little more

208
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,919
fascinating to watch what about you

209
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,600
what's your final verdict this was kind

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,760
of close for me had we lost one of the

211
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,250
nonviolent side plots that kind of

212
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,020
didn't really they had like the surprise

213
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,479
ending and had it been one more little

214
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,830
side quest where he goes beats up a

215
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,060
bunch of people I think this could have

216
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,159
pushed to 6 because like I don't feel

217
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,020
like I think that the critics are really

218
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,510
really hard on this film 30% is really

219
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,460
bad yeah yeah and that is great

220
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,290
and then this this is gonna back up

221
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,339
everything met it like there but

222
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,140
everyone's at about 50% that's kind of

223
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,920
where I'm at right now

224
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,060
I wish it would've been a little bit

225
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,680
higher because I like the first yeah but

226
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,810
I'm gonna get this in so I would also

227
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,820
give it a five but because on being

228
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,580
harder on movies these days than they

229
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,279
four out of 10 and why is that just

230
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,110
because I have to be harder on movies no

231
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,810
because this is a sequel and when you're

232
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,810
doing a sequel you can you absolutely

233
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,970
can't have this feel like a lazy cache

234
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,970
yeah they let off my desk yeah because

235
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,770
it's such a mixture of a lot of

236
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,410
different leftover ideas or just

237
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,959
additional extended ideas that could

238
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,880
have fit in the original film or that

239
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,800
you like I bet you this stuff happens

240
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,970
and they're like there yeah this stuff

241
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,010
happens but it's scatterbrained

242
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,420
throughout the film and it doesn't

243
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,790
really come together as a cohesive hold

244
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,760
his past comes back to haunt him but

245
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,980
it's pretty predictable in that sense

246
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,770
and less engaging especially when the

247
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,500
boss in the final battle isn't quite as

248
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,870
good as the memorable scene where he

249
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,209
goes into that you know real fancy gold

250
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,459
room with all these you know gangster

251
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,290
Russian guys or something like that it

252
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,320
just kicks everybody's ass so first one

253
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,500
is superior guys and so definitely by

254
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,540
far so stick around if you want the

255
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,490
spoiler section if not thank you so much

256
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,260
for watching and we'll see you guys on

257
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:23,770
the next angry Joe show bye guys

258
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,420
all right welcome to the spoiler section

259
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,720
uh anybody want to start cuz I already

260
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,520
know what I want to talk about first one

261
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,990
it was the worst assassin ever

262
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,240
he's a lyft driver Robert McCall is like

263
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,210
a lyft driver and this guy's sent out to

264
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,160
kill him so he's in the backseat waiting

265
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,630
years ago this mine it's my daughter's

266
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,180
birthday she's turning five he's staring

267
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,980
him down like nobody's business like

268
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,150
what the

269
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,190
this guy's creepy is about to do

270
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,110
something pulls out a knife

271
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,840
chef's knife has a gun

272
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,620
Oh picking up my daughter surprise no

273
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,660
all you have to do is you know I take it

274
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:13,970
to the airport Denzel Washington has

275
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,170
plot armor and that's why I would

276
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,670
probably gave it five across the board

277
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,590
for from me because a lot of the

278
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,080
situations have no tension it's still

279
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,160
entertaining to watch

280
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
Denzel kick some ass but I just wish

281
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,330
that there was more at stake in

282
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,270
individual fights my teams were better

283
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,490
like I love watching him beat up those

284
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,860
like frat guys in the penthouse like

285
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,150
they had taken advantage of this girl

286
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,650
and he's her driver on this feel kind of

287
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,960
an advertisement for Liv I was about to

288
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,780
say that it's like that like him being a

289
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,510
lyft driver was point is annoying

290
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,420
because well no I wouldn't say it's

291
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,610
pointless job why I like the idea of

292
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,560
being a cab driver or uber or lyft

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,900
because you hear stories and you can

294
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,790
actually kind of do something about it

295
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,200
so I thought that was clever you only

296
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,390
get one it just carry it once so he

297
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,680
doesn't have an identity there's

298
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,910
multiple which one you know the old guy

299
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,730
that's one of his regular drivers you

300
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,150
know customers a lot of them however one

301
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,390
of them to two or three but yeah so that

302
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,970
was another one usually in the spoiler

303
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,010
section we like to point out plot holes

304
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,650
and stupid stuff one of them is this

305
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,920
final battle in this one the movie feels

306
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,750
the need

307
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,340
maybe the movie kind of feels like oh

308
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,490
 act 1 and 2 were kind of slow burns

309
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,920
even for me the director was like so

310
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,850
let's just throw in a random storm okay

311
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,080
so far they didn't talking about the

312
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,610
hurricane the entire yeah they're like a

313
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,040
storms coming storms coming oh my god

314
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,940
that's foreshadowing and the storm

315
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,890
finally arrives on this one little part

316
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,990
of the island that they're evacuating he

317
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,690
uses a fake badge to get in and lure

318
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,380
which is his old hometown see here's

319
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,090
what I feel about this film it sounds

320
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,730
really great on paper when when you know

321
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,800
oh he goes back to his hometown and he

322
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,070
defeats his old team cuz all those guys

323
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,190
are supposedly on his own yeah and it

324
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,410
just sounds so amazing on paper but

325
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,920
executed it feels so distant like it's

326
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,560
not connected right and you don't really

327
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,570
feel like these guys were his team he

328
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,820
does talk with one guy in particular uh

329
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,850
Pedro Bosco Pedro Pascal in Game of

330
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,480
Thrones

331
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,220
I know was him but it looks different

332
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,460
yeah he saved his money he got his eye

333
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,960
ripped out like his thumb went through

334
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,730
his eye like how many times does Pedro

335
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,200
Pascal have to have his like I would I

336
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,960
don't know exactly for that so this

337
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,700
final battle there's 100 mile an hour

338
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,020
winds and what is very good dude the

339
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,490
first thing he does all right he only

340
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,680
brings four guys with him these would be

341
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,560
the most amazing mercs getting every job

342
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,100
done but it's it's absolute suicide if

343
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,690
you know anything about close quarter

344
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,690
battle and urban combat you do not try

345
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,170
to clear 3040 houses on this

346
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,510
island where a guy had a head start on

347
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,310
you and could have set a booby traps

348
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,050
they could have just simply said the

349
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,730
first two guys that died and they're cut

350
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,620
down to 50% efficiency we're getting the

351
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,320
 out of here and we'll go and pull

352
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,080
when he least expects it like they do

353
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,780
throughout the film assaulting his

354
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,360
friend Susan and killing her Susan dies

355
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,460
they don't rush because they kill count

356
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,530
for no reason but but hold on it so in

357
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,420
this final battle first thing he does he

358
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,070
gets there he's alright everybody fan

359
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,089
out split up going to separate areas

360
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,379
so that he can pick you off one at a

361
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,420
time it was like why we do mystery team

362
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,809
all right gang let's split up and while

363
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,089
I act as a sniper in the middle of a

364
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,819
 tsunami so the bullets are gonna

365
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:51,420
go all over the place and I'm

366
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,870
isolating myself as a sitting duck for

367
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,899
this equalizer so it was just so stupid

368
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,709
and I hated it but it gave an honor to

369
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,170
it sounds so good on paper okay he's

370
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,509
gonna fight this rival team and all that

371
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,009
and it's gonna be so awesome but the

372
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,529
kills are rather but at that point why

373
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:12,180
don't you have somebody work like in the

374
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,550
tables like that doesn't sound right why

375
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,620
would a sniper go hook in the tower

376
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,319
during a tsunami shut up Greg you're

377
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,360
fired yeah get out of here actually I

378
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,100
liked all the kills like I really liked

379
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,050
the get the guy getting shot through the

380
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,730
face with the spear gun that was pretty

381
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,249
sweet actually the guy getting blown up

382
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,350
in the the grain silo explosion he makes

383
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,809
like an artificial so he fills he's in a

384
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,879
bakery and he turns all the fans on and

385
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,040
he fills that with flour so let me draw

386
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,629
that because the kills are good they're

387
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:40,769
kind of cool and then the other guy he

388
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,149
just chops up in little pieces like he

389
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,639
sits there just kind of slices him up

390
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,459
with knife gita' but you explained that

391
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,920
flashbang one because he always is that

392
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,540
every single time they're throwing yes

393
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,279
that's bangs to try to clear a house so

394
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,660
he goes into the bakery and he slices

395
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,339
open all the flour bags and then turns

396
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,230
on a fan so this the the room that he

397
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,509
just walked into is now filled with you

398
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,279
know flour particulate and it's a highly

399
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,679
oxygenated area and so they throw on the

400
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,529
flashbang and then it blows up like he

401
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,089
gets out of that I don't know if I ever

402
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,329
do that yeah

403
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,600
it might have been a different type of

404
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,139
cooking material than flour works like a

405
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,850
lien yeah grain silos it was probably

406
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,749
gas - basically they knew what they were

407
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,879
 and they underestimated and they

408
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,559
got their asses Kim and it was

409
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,069
entertaining to watch but you know you

410
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,290
knew he was not in danger at all never

411
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,639
never in them

412
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,559
no pager it like Pedro died the way you

413
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,089
think he would like first he gets a

414
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,220
thumb in the eye and then like break his

415
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,649
arm he knew he was the bad guy yeah yeah

416
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,839
now I start they got me with showing his

417
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,670
family and giving his daughter grapes

418
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,249
and ya know so I was like all Sam he's

419
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:52,989
nine and you know if they made it seem

420
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,730
like that car parked out there with the

421
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,889
old team was gonna kill him - yeah so

422
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,290
that one was a good turnaround but I I

423
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,689
felt like he was and then they faked me

424
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,600
out I don't get me feel great because I

425
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,309
was faked out into heaven and I was like

426
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,230
going he called him on the phone and

427
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,360
rang it was clever so let's see that the

428
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,579
film has some great moments today that's

429
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,370
what I would give it's not its average

430
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,279
then it just it had this movie not been

431
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,990
as slow and I didn't me and her through

432
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,250
all of these stories that didn't matter

433
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,169
and like I said if there had been one

434
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,120
more story one of his little side quests

435
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,610
had another like a payoff at the end

436
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,019
where he just beats up a bunch of people

437
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,639
I think this movie could have been a six

438
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:34,450
or seven yeah um golly now I feel like

439
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,549
you know four out of ten it probably is

440
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,620
more like what you guys think a five out

441
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,450
of ten but I was a little rougher on it

442
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,799
because it is the sequel and I'm

443
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,260
expecting it to be original yeah Isaac's

444
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,899
a little better and when I go out there

445
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,399
a second time you really want to see

446
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,490
Robert McCall you know go and do his

447
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,649
thing John wick raised the stakes and

448
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:57,130
you know and really happy I'm bleeding

449
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,470
and like gushing blood everywhere but

450
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,850
he's still good did you like John worked

451
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,750
you better than John like one actually I

452
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,370
think it's about on par just in

453
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,380
different ways yeah not only for me it

454
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,289
was nobody commands don't it's it's

455
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:14,620
difficult I think I might have it's just

456
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,720
it's tough because that initial seeing

457
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,370
this world for the first time you get so

458
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,460
excited enjoy

459
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,149
the kind of repeat some of that stuff in

460
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:26,990
the second film but you know extra but

461
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,690
they give you a little extra more action

462
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,240
raise the state's kind of a morning you

463
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,149
know an interesting boss and and here

464
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:37,100
that's the stuff that was lacking so

465
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,220
yeah anything else they did the plotline

466
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,620
with murals and and this kid who was

467
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,140
falling in with the gang so he goes in

468
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,890
there and basically beats up people in

469
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,600
the projects this gang

470
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,909
kicks their ass to people yeah

471
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,770
and there's doesn't seem to be any

472
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,309
repercussions under those guys are so

473
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,649
brain dead and and just shitty human

474
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,029
beings that they would probably go and

475
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,799
attack him you know yeah that's nice

476
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,429
thank you

477
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,980
yeah I was like guys now the actions

478
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,899
about to start this gangs would be like

479
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:09,710
what the was that

480
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,450
let's go retaliate nobody comes in my

481
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,549
house blah blah blah mm-hmm I was like

482
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,950
waiting only it's like no they do the

483
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,919
plot line where his friend from his old

484
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,299
squad

485
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,970
you know Pedro Pedro Pascal is the real

486
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,899
bad guy and kills his Susan his contact

487
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,690
and anyone has to fight his old team so

488
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,799
that's kind of what they did but it

489
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,440
sounds better than it was it was kind of

490
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,120
badass when he stood in front of all of

491
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,770
them and just said like I'm gonna kill

492
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,860
each and every love and then he liked me

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,100
for every negative yeah the perfect

494
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,510
getaway for that scene too because he's

495
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,039

496

510
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,640
I was watching this Jo I was like you

511
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,130

512
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,590
Washington is the big boss bad guy who

513
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,750
is always stronger than these guys yeah

514
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,090
and those guys were they those guys are

515
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,580

521
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,289
did those jobs on the side uh-huh yeah

522
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,809
because he was still talking about Susan

523
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,400
