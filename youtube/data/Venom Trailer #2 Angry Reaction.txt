3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,309
I got a new pair of glasses I've been

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,019
going to the doctor a lot lately and

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,090
dealing with some family stuff I'd

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,639
rather keep off the internet but Oh

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,400
bunch of you guys have requested that we

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,010

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,590

[Music]

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,410
I hate it when they do this keep your

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,699
tip I know I need to stop bitching about

17
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm gonna talk over it for copyright

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,350
reasons so expect that so it looks like

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,100
they're old that is that she attacks him

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,570
right off the bat that screen by the way

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,149
they're changing Eddie Brock his whole

22
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:17,130
personality okay so this is stuff we've

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,560
seen already but now this is new stuff

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,100
here is this guy and why I don't like

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,110
him though oh that's something that

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,440
symbiote right there it's twisting his

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:45,140
fucking body all over the place ooh oh

28
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,050
my god Joe I love that voice that yeah

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,800

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,690

31
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:17,820
oh shit dude he's so big he's fucking

32
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:27,500

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,170

34
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,160

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,790

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,510
the hell is that venom what the photo

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,640
should that looks weird but I mean how

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,190
are you gonna do how else are you gonna

40
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:27,220
miss the way

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:46,810
I don't think holy shit

42
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,330
Joe it's a fucking comedy you know what

43
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,370
Wow okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

44
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,310
we have to go through this together we

45
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,720
have to go through this trailer let's

46
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,780
see let's see how do we let's get our

47
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,140
webcam a little bigger here

48
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,910
let's okay so we got that fucking

49
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,230
annoying thing which I'm not even gonna

50
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,940
talk about alright so most of the shit

51
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,320
is all the same but I do want to talk

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,170
about so I've done a little bit of

53
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,850
research now that the trailers been out

54
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,540
for a while

55
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,540
this is scream so the symbiotes infects

56
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,260
her and scream is comic accurate she was

57
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,320
one of the five children I believe if I

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,380
know there was a maximum carnage which

59
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,140
kind of confuses me on things but there

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,120
is five symbiote children from what I'm

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,070
thinking of here this is gonna be a

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,350
storyline of venom and his children

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,230
that's what I personally think but it

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,140
could just be venom and five or four

65
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,630
other symbiote since venom is one of

66
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,140
them okay so obviously at first they're

67
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,900
changing Eddie Brock's character here he

68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,910
is no longer the sort of you know super

69
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,930
evil guy who here's the thing do you

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,760
know that the symbiote attached to

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,610
spider-man first yes okay that was in

72
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,010
secret war and then he rejected the

73
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,930
symbiote and so the symbiote hates

74
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,270
spider-man and he managed to hook up

75
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,730
with bready Eddie Brock who also hates

76
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,370
spider-man for personal reasons got him

77
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,780
fired I think took his girlfriend oh

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,940
forget it what exactly it was but that

79
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,220
since they both hate spider-man and when

80
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,590
they merge together it's all about being

81
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,570
a villain it's all about murdering

82
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,820
people killing people and getting back

83
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,910
at spider-man that wouldn't work as a

84
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,569
film is what Hollywood is thinking

85
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,210
now I would like to see it like just a

86
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,089
pure film of murder and angry but but it

87
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:47,889
just doesn't work especially when they

88
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,929
want to go the antihero route and I do

89
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:54,189
want venom venom as an antihero and so

90
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,869
in order to get the antihero they do

91
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:59,139
kind of need to change his backstory for

92
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,749
mass audience didn't really work out

93
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:13,869
he's a clusterfuck okay so what I want

94
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,930
to say right away is this trailer

95
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,659
excited me but it excited me in a

96
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,509
different way than I thought it would

97
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,649
what do you what did you think overall

98
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,490
impression of the trailer okay so now

99
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,050
we're going to see this one as opposed

100
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,349
to like the looks like an upgrade uh-huh

101
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,360
so so now what we're looking at is we're

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,129
looking at the symbiote now what I'm

103
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:43,599
hearing is that this is toxic or talks

104
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,619
in and from what I know this is the

105
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,899
first deviation from the comic books

106
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:55,180
okay toxin man this completely fucks

107
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,919
this dude up I mean this is kind of

108
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,389
creepy

109
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,409
now toxin is actually in the comics he's

110
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,949
kind of a good guy and he's one of

111
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,379
carnage his son he's carnage his son and

112
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,079
it's one of the only symbiotes that

113
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,469
spider-man considers his ally and he had

114
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,809
his own comic series but here they have

115
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:18,999
completely changing toxin it looks like

116
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:21,339
he's just a fucking bad guy and just

117
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,009
killing people so I guess it goes up his

118
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,019
butt and through his fucking mouth I

119
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,459
mean that's nasty

120
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,169
never won shit up the butt is gonna come

121
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,139
out the mouth because that's a fear of

122
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,639
everything right so we've got this scene

123
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,129
which we've seen before and it's doing

124
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,039
this weird sort of visual effect that in

125
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,249
my opinion doesn't look very good and a

126
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,349
lot of people have sort of made fun of

127
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:52,360
it but whereas I did react poorly to it

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,140
at first

129
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,690
but now I think it works because if you

130
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,820
know the comics you know that any sort

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,460
of sonic waves that's how they defeat

132
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,510
venom these soldiers with stupid Robin

133
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,770
Rob Liefeld guns are massive pipes yeah

134
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,280
pipes will fire sonic waves and you know

135
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,050
he will fucking the symbiote freaks out

136
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,700
so yeah they could have done the

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,430
symbiote like little little blobs of it

138
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,200
coming off which might have looked

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,030
better and I think people are just

140
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,530
thinking this effect doesn't look too

141
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,930
good but you know what we move e's not

142
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,200
out yet maybe and what I've seen is the

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,720
CGI has improved from trailer to trailer

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,870
in my opinion I love absolutely love the

145
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,660
fact that they seem to be different

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,210
people so in the comic books they're the

147
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,180
same they have the same soul same

148
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,800
motivation but here

149
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,960
venom seems to have a completely

150
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,030
different motivation from Eddie and then

151
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,520
Eddie has to either he's apologizing the

152
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,090
entire time that's the only that's

153
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,380
actually a part I don't like well we'll

154
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,350
get there so I mean I love this this is

155
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,360
the fascinating parts of the film the

156
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,580
dichotomy between the two personalities

157
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,490
living in one body and here's the one

158
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:23,600
thing that venom gets right the size

159
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
they don't make him skinny like Topher

160
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,970
Grace

161
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,590
they don't make his voice shitty like

162
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,280
Topher Grace he's not Topher Grace and

163
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,380
Topher Grace isn't anywhere in this film

164
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,990
yes and venom looks cool

165
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,550
yes Topher sorry - we like you in 70s

166
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,220
show and look it's like you talking shit

167
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,770
to me are you fucking talking to me do

168
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,290
you realize I can control your body and

169
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,910
I'm gonna show you how to enjoy your

170
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,270
buddy

171
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:57,080
go up against a wall beat that's one of

172
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,300
the fascinating parts of this is we

173
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,850
don't know Venom's motivation what do

174
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,180
you think he wants

175
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,060
against who one of the other symbiotes

176
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,830
fighter man's not in it so what do you

177
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,020
think his vent his vent his motivation

178
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,660
is holy shit that looks fucking creepy

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,670
so a lot of people freeze-frame this and

180
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,680
to me it looks bad but I guarantee you

181
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,370
it's gonna look great

182
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,930
this looks that mean that's about as

183
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,020
best as you can make it look the thing

184
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,270
is in the comics is very easy to draw

185
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,580
the symbiotes falling apart and coming

186
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,210
into little pieces and on screen it it

187
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,760
it's gonna look weird because we've

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,590
never seen anything like it

189
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,680
so this trailer if anything gave me more

190
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,530
confidence than ever in in a venom film

191
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:54,560
I know that looks weird I know it looks

192
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,770
so weird but here's an example of the

193
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,780
movie doing what the comics has never

194
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,840
done the comics has never manifested

195
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,400
Venom's face on a different limb from

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
you know him and have him talking so

197
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,230
this is gonna be an interesting scene it

198
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,820
comes off from his shoulder though yeah

199
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,700
okay that's crazy that's crazy and then

200
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,070
apparently he gives him super well

201
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,220
obviously gives him superpowers but you

202
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,810
know just like in the comics it will

203
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,290
repair his body so I think this is after

204
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,150
he probably falls off a motorcycle what

205
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,860
is going on over here it just looks like

206
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,690
a legs and then there's somebody humping

207
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,850
him or something

208
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,800
they ran him over or so they ran him

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,460
over right this is the same scene and

210
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,010
the guy is leering over him like I got

211
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,600
you but then all of a sudden he fucking

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,300
grabs him here and he's surprised cuz

213
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,860
that guy would have never let his guard

214
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,690
down like that unless he thought he was

215
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,310
dead

216
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,510
alright Joe what do you think about the

217
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,670
fact that this is Venom's costume

218
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,760
there's no symbol on his chest I heard a

219
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,140
lot of complaints about that I'm okay

220
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,970
without it as long as it looks

221
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,490
proportional and he looks like a

222
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,170
creature like I know like been I'm

223
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,830
supposed to look like I'm okay without

224
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,550
the symbol phantom looks so good yeah I

225
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,930
am so okay with no symbol and you want

226
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,620
to know what I think that it's strategic

227
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,530
there's a reason there's no symbol

228
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,270
because they're leaving that as a

229
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,860
fanservice for fans

230
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,670
if venom does well and if Marvel allows

231
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,820
these two universes to come together

232
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,310
then once he meets spider-man or sees

233
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,300
spider-man

234
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,020
he's going to manifest that symbol of a

235
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,660
sort of tarantula on his chest to mimic

236
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,780
spider-man in a mocking kind of way

237
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,910
they're gonna meet and he's gonna mock

238
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,520
him Oh angry Joe prediction 2018 if that

239
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,150
happens Marvel pay me we didn't tell you

240
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,130
of those predictions I want to see I

241
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,830
know okay we're starting the production

242
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,480
now if he manifests a symbol okay if he

243
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,540
joins the MCU that is what's gonna

244
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,080
happen

245
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,480
all right anyway but right here we get

246
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,760
to talk about how funny venom is not

247
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,700
only here but in the end I'm so glad

248
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,740
they did this end clip to hurt in the

249
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,520
wind yeah it's so crazy it doesn't mean

250
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,690
how am I missing the whole thing it's

251
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,220
been the wrong trailer the whole time

252
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:50,880
yeah this is the old trailer

253
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,190
go to three good three something is too

254
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:08,860
dirty okay we're gonna eat this we're

255
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,310
gonna eat that he is a jokester joke cuz

256
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,260
I guarantee you I mean actually that's

257
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,290
not a joke he will do it here's the

258
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,410
thing in the comics he he likes to boast

259
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,930
that he eats brains but he doesn't

260
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,660
really actually ever eat brains so I

261
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,220
think it's part of his dark sense of

262
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,550
humor

263
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,460
cuz venom knows how scary he is and how

264
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,770
confident he is and how fucking evil

265
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,260
he's like I'm gonna do this smiling

266
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,850
you're just talking I just love I mean

267
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,010
thank God Phantom so Wray guys and Devin

268
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,050
has this little action figure venom and

269
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,090
he's like so huge and muscular and he's

270
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,040
got multiple heads on his back and chin

271
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,050
does anybody I'm that action figure this

272
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:02,420
reminds me of that day

273
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,709
never seen that by the way I've never

274
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,420
seen a turd in the wind he probably

275
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,670
could have used something different but

276
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,850
but here's the thing Joe he's an alien

277
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:18,959
he doesn't really understand alright

278
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,720
guys so I this is the longest trailer

279
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,160
reaction just because we've had all this

280
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,410
extra time but I'm gonna kind of skip

281
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,350
through it a bit so Eddie Brock is

282
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,269
obviously what's up damn it Joe Joe 43

283
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,399
just bill I hate you subscription oh

284
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,360
thank you for helping us out

285
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,339
okay Joe hold on we got to focus we're

286
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,499
in the middle of recording all right so

287
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:47,970
next is okay so he's got a girlfriend

288
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,949
character how that factors in hopefully

289
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,259
it's not too lovey-dovey but it does

290
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,410
create a little bit of emotional gravity

291
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,749
hopefully it pays off we get this scene

292
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,730
with a SWAT team how is he gonna get out

293
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,589
of this is he gonna murder all of these

294
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,499
guys or is he gonna go the antihero

295
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:08,759
route and sort of disable the guys and

296
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,709
we just spoiled it right here he doesn't

297
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,360
actually kill this guy he just throws

298
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,879
him out of the out of the way

299
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,379
his girlfriend's running for some reason

300
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,569
your scream again she definitely kills

301
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,509
everybody and here is the main villain

302
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,100
of the film so this is the thing

303
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,279
everybody was thinking we were so

304
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,050
worried because we have that main

305
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,389
character the CEO guy that we've never

306
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,399
seen before this young Indian looking

307
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,339
guy and he's rich and maybe he has mind

308
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,040
powers because everything got thrown

309
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,689
aside but it was just unfinished CGI

310
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:44,970
because this is why everything was

311
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,879
thrown aside so it's so weird that the

312
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,389
first trailer shows it without this I've

313
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,209
never seen that before have you it like

314
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,029
changes the whole dynamic anyway so this

315
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,220
is called riot Joe and he's the main

316
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,220
villain so this is the the bad CEO

317
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,949
inside of his body okay with and then we

318
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,699
can see him tearing venomoth are you

319
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,909
okay with this did here's the thing it's

320
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:16,169
not carnage maybe they're saving you

321
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,539
thought it was carnage yeah because why

322
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,839
because in the film woody harrelson why

323
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,009
he's not here anywhere yet so so a lot

324
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,689
of people will say this looks fakie and

325
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,519
and if you look at their heads it does

326
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,190
that fake it looks stupid I will say

327
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,830
this this looks stupid but but there is

328
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,739
no other way to do this this is about as

329
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,570
best as it can look right now with our

330
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,730
current technology I think this is about

331
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,230
as best as it can look now

332
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,440
here's what I would have done yes there

333
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,679
are humans inside the thing yes you can

334
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,230
show them because they're actors and you

335
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,200
need to show no don't fucking show them

336
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,570
just show this battle between two

337
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,639
monsters because what this does is it

338
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,279
breaks the immersion just don't show

339
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,379
these guys just show his head ripping

340
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,080
off and you're like Oh Venom's dead

341
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,159
Venom's dead the audience will be like

342
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,389
what the fuck

343
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,249
Venom's head just got ripped off and we

344
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,309
didn't see that oh no his head is safe

345
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:19,649
so if you do that and then show the head

346
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,450
later once he hits the ground then it's

347
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,759
all way more impactful all right but

348
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,019
this is gonna turn into an hour-long

349
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,549
video so we did a thorough venom trailer

350
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,519
2 reaction a week late I don't know when

351
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,669
this came out but this trailer made me

352
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:37,859
so excited for venom I think it's gonna

353
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,440
be a great film you remember when we did

354
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,480
our first reaction you said venom was

355
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,789
only gonna show up at the end yes you

356
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:45,539
were wrong

357
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,669
at least from what I've seen you know

358
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,279
you're wrong so I'm happy

359
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,549

363
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,730
the venom sit or you know the symbol on

364
