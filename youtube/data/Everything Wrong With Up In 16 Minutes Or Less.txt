2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,139
we're all painfully aware that Disney

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,730
and Pixar are the same thing Disney

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,290
still feels the need to jerk itself off

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,820
for 40 seconds before the movie starts

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,750
movie steals the expositional

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,220
documentary inside the actual movie

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,850
motif from Citizen Kane science doesn't

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,670
make discoveries people do and also

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,439
these two assholes and whoever's filming

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,840
this newsreel and supposed to the normal

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,340
everyday paddy wagon which was somehow

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,170
lesser capacity and had no chance in

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,640
hell of telling us what era this movie

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,399
is set in these look more like dog

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,899
torture devices than contraptions can

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,989
see poor canine comfort it sounds like

18
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,370
Pixar's turn-of-the-century idiom

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,079
generator just malfunction I mean holy

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,820
mackerel how many cockeyed phrases are

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,860
these bones gonna throw at me why

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,210
because this guy doesn't know how to use

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,619
a compass or this guy doesn't know how

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,420
bones work or possibly because it's

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,680
convenient to the plot Karl conveniently

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,180
overhears Ellie say this just as he

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,439
walks past the dilapidated house

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,030
prompting him to find out who said it if

29
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,380
Ellie just saw the same screening of

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,759
Monza's documentary how was she able to

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,170
find this abandoned house and rig it up

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,729
to play Explorer before Karl had enough

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,049
time to walk past it and catch her in

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,770
the middle of her narrative nope he

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,659
won't be able to for 60 years Karl's

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,400
balloon that Ellie now inexplicably

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,079
possesses still has enough helium in it

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,640
to lift a large stick just high enough

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,470
into the air to go into Karl's room and

40
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,240
buy some kind of dog talking level

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,710
witchcraft is able to change directions

42
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,030
as soon as it reaches Carl's bedroom

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,140
window behind every great man is a woman

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,549
pointing and yelling at him to make

45
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,470
uncapable promises movie completely

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,270
blows past Ellie dropping her tomboy

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,829
persona and how this couple managed to

48
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,060
stay in love during their awkward

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,740
highschool years in college years based

50
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,240
on their mutual respect of Charles Muntz

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,680
this is a prime example of when

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,240
sentimental value goes totally wrong

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,860
instead of buying a house they can

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,360
actually live in Carl and Ellie decide

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,920
to buy the condemned house they met in

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,300
and spend the first few years of their

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,890
lives basically rebuilding the entire

58
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,000
think I can't even imagine what the

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,380
inspection for this was like and this

60
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,610
house has been abandoned for well over a

61
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,319
decade that's not a fun renovation

62
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,420
project that's a tennis Shack Elian Carl

63
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,920
do manual labor in their wedding clothes

64
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,420
movie takes place in an alternate

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,190
universe where super helium exists but

66
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,630
adoption apparently doesn't weren't

67
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,220
quite ready to explain miscarriages to

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,930
your children well now you have to how

69
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,340
much change could they possibly have in

70
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,170
that jug fifteen dollars and if they

71
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,610
fill it up maybe thirty they'll have

72
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,020
enough money to check out a documentary

73
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,490
about Paradise Falls but will definitely

74
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,840
be a few thousand dollars short of

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,550
actually paying for a trip also when we

76
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,080
actually go to Paradise Falls later in

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
the film we see that it's still

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,230
completely remote and uninhabited how do

79
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,580
they plan on actually getting there are

80
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,840
they saving up for their own Zeppelin

81
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,850
also Paradise Falls is based on a real

82
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,530
place in Venezuela called can Diamond a

83
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,060
tional park and if we make believe

84
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,070
that's the actual Paradise Falls I bet

85
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,090
it would be challenging for them to

86
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,650
claim residence in a Venezuelan National

87
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,360
Park goddamn they did a fantastic job

88
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
restoring that probably 70 year old

89
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,480
house did they reinforce it with steel

90
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,489
beams and then suddenly and without any

91
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,200
warning Pixar sends you into a montage

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,209
that is both full of sadness and joy and

93
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:10,680
more sadness without a word of dialogue

94
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,360
spoken it's like one of those great

95
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,980
Pixar shorts that precede all the

96
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,750
full-length features and I think I just

97
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,370
cried a little it's downright incredible

98
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,810
and we're removing five sins for its

99
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,420
brilliance I believe I made my position

100
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,000
to your boss quite clear you poured

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,040
fruit juice at his gas tank I find this

102
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,690
unlikely this assumes the boss drives a

103
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,620
car that doesn't have one of those

104
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,450
spring-loaded gas doors that you'd have

105
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,739
to actually break into the car to open

106
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,600
or the boss just leaves his car unlocked

107
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,670
all day at a construction site also this

108
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,470
old man who uses a cane somehow managed

109
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,730
to get to the car without being seen

110
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,350
carrying a funnel and some prune juice

111
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,000
and how did they even figure out it was

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,620
prune juice unless they saw him and let

113
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,690
him do it Carl told them Lord they ran

114
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,010
it to a lab and why didn't the boss

115
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,220
press charges House John Ratzenberger is

116
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,690
acting like this is new information even

117
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,220
though he said earlier also I have a

118
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,540
hard time believing whatever faceless

119
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,860
corporation is in charge of this project

120
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,630
doesn't just pay off whoever and abuse a

121
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,250
little eminent domain to steal Carl's

122
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,720
house away from it Russell's persistence

123
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,250
leads me to believe he thinks Carl is

124
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,620
the only old person in this town earlier

125
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,750
we told the Carl juice at his gas tank

126
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,459
and that didn't seem to create any

127
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,989
issues but after Carl assaults this

128
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,549
worker he's forced to sell his house and

129
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,380
move into an old folks home I understand

130
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,459
that assault is a worse crime than

131
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,140
damage of personal property but the

132
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,490
latter is still a crime and that

133
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,660
seemingly went completely unpunished

134
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,039
these assholes still wear their

135
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,150
sunglasses in court

136
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,340
no so-called judge would allow so was

137
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,570
crowned sentenced by the court to live

138
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,070
in a retirement community is it a

139
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,139
retirement village / prison man karl was

140
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,090
a terrible balloon salesman also how did

141
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,110
he have the time to blow up all these

142
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,669
balloons and keep them hidden before the

143
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,350
Shady Oaks folks showed up and we really

144
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,789
expected to believe that Karl isn't

145
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,259
physically fit enough to walk down the

146
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,910
stairs in his own house but can climb

147
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,320
all over the roof to tie those balloons

148
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,850
and set up a steering mechanism there's

149
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,350
no amount of loons this movie could

150
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,669
animate that would convince me balloons

151
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,229
could rip a house from its foundation

152
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,120
and all this connected utilities also

153
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,620
Carl doesn't disconnect the electricity

154
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,270
in water before his grand escape also

155
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,830
also if these balloons could rip up a

156
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,300
house off its foundation and let it fly

157
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,280
away then how the actual was Karl able

158
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,750
to keep them concealed behind his house

159
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,250
until this point are the impossibly

160
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,720
giant tarps that he has for some reason

161
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,330
as dense as neutron stars also times

162
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,160
three way to use an increasingly scarce

163
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,900
resource to fly your house irresponsibly

164
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,880
you jackass even though karl has yet to

165
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
engage his steering apparatus the house

166
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,940
manages to avoid all the tall buildings

167
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,410
during its ascent Karl's balloon house

168
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,419
is a dick to analog television Oh ain't

169
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,800
that nice the airplane billboard

170
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,510
features South America prominently in

171
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,889
this North American town you know

172
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,180
because of the story and all these

173
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,680
shower curtains make clever sales and

174
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
imply that Karl always possess the

175
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,860
knowledge how to fly a house without at

176
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,660
least one practice track also numerous

177
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,800
military and police would have been

178
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,940
called when they heard the reports of a

179
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,349
flying house using balloons but

180
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:38,550
fortunately for Karl this took place

181
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,289
during Taco Tuesday and no one called to

182
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:44,460
care oh really then where were you when

183
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,260
this happened not only do I not see any

184
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,729
wilderness explorers under Karl's porch

185
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,650
but I also can't see a way to get under

186
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,120
the porch in the first place you'd think

187
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,099
but karl has done zero steering since he

188
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,270
got in the air and it's totally

189
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,070
absolutely amazing he hasn't checked to

190
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,599
see if he needs to dodge aircraft or

191
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,099
tall buildings but if you train these

192
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,240
balloons well they know where to go Wow

193
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,810
good thing

194
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,220
Russell is impossible here so you could

195
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,110
warn Karl about the clouds not Karl

196
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,099
would have just been sleeping in his

197
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,720
chair when this storm came in and movie

198
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,070
over at least we would have had the

199
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,780
montage Karl's house doesn't completely

200
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,099
break apart nor do enough of the

201
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,599
balloons pop in the storm causing them

202
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:19,580
to fall out of the sky

203
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,740
[Music]

204
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,360
so I piloted this house all the way to

205
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,349
South America anyway was Karl asleep for

206
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,849
several days or does the movie want me

207
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,440
to believe they were a storm and a nap

208
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,060
away from Venezuela the momentum of this

209
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,919
giant house guided by balloons and being

210
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,810
dragged by an elderly person and a child

211
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,039
stops right at the edge of the cliff

212
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,900
just like all the airplanes tanks fast

213
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,100
and furious isn't starship

214
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,450
enterprise's we've ever seen you think

215
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,280
that a 50-ton kite wouldn't allow a kid

216
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,720
and an old man to maintain their

217
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,430
position but you'd be wrong not only do

218
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,230
they drop out of the sky right on top of

219
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,430
the place where Carl and Ellie always

220
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,930
wanted to go but they just so happen to

221
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,400
be adjacent to the Vista that's painted

222
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,330
above their fireplace

223
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:01,440
the same angle and everything talk about

224
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,210
crotchety carl accidentally flies his

225
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,680
house hundreds of miles and ends up just

226
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,150
a few short miles of where he wants to

227
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,680
be and he's still pissed he should

228
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,030
probably just settle and plop his house

229
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,200
right here and begin starving to death

230
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,430
at least they could look at the

231
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,380
waterfall while they died after all we

232
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,230
weighed down how what convenient physics

233
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,390
did they get down here in the last scene

234
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,740
they were walking along a cliff where

235
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,030
there were no trees but now it looks

236
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,960
like they're walking through the thick

237
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,460
jungle at the bottom of the cliffs did

238
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,720
they cut the scene where Russell and

239
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,860
Carl decided to take the physically

240
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:35,400
impossible route yeah so because there

241
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,170
aren't Tigers per se let's just stop in

242
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,280
the middle of the South American jungle

243
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,380
because no Tigers equals no other kinds

244
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,180
of animals that can kill you snipe even

245
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,620
though Russell still has his zoology

246
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,270
badge he still thinks this pterodactyl

247
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,890
size footprint was left behind by us

248
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,520
night oh I guess it can be forgiven that

249
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,260
Russell as a kid doesn't know what a

250
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,910
snipe looks like but I'm kind of curious

251
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,620
as to why he didn't research what Snipes

252
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,970
look like considering that he knew that

253
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,590
tiger fact about South America and looks

254
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,270
to be a dutiful wilderness explorer I

255
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,380
mean he should have known they don't

256
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,150
exist after the first day also why does

257
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,890
this kid even think the snipe came with

258
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,150
them on this journey in the first place

259
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,980
wasn't Russell under and inside the

260
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,970
house during this trip to South America

261
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm fine with this misidentified snipe

262
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,750
for humor and story purposes just not

263
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,800
logic purposes Kevin a made-up animal

264
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,420
that is indigenous to South America has

265
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,830
a keen understanding of the English

266
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,190
language yeah that's totally gross but

267
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,600
then Carl picks it up completely dry

268
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,190
within 10 seconds of this happening oh

269
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,600
hey now they're back up on top of the

270
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,190
cliff you'd think since they have access

271
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,660
to some kind of wormhole they just use

272
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,919
it to magically go to the other side of

273
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,270
the cliff instead of just bouncing from

274
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,620
the top to the bottom but here we are

275
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,360
either Russell's pack is exclusively

276
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
filled with chocolate bars or he has

277
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,419
some sort of infinite chocolate bar that

278
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,620
came from the same factory where they

279
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,970
made Mary Poppins bag

280
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,250
Koller he is a good and smart master and

281
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,230
he made me this collar so that I may

282
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,279
talk squirrel

283
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,470
well is adorable and hilarious removing

284
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,829
us in jingle I use that course Doug's

285
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,810
collars program with Spanish a southern

286
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,730
accent and Japanese you know the three

287
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,860
main languages have you seen a bird I

288
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,779
want to find one and I've been honest

289
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm a great tracker so does this collar

290
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,829
give these dogs a basic level of human

291
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,240
intelligence - or is this maybe

292
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,800
suggesting that dogs have the capacity

293
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,209
to think just like we do but are unable

294
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,709
to express themselves because they don't

295
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,959
have a few in vocal cords also if I put

296
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,939
this collar on a cow or a chicken would

297
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,259
they be able to speak in the same way

298
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,970
whether that mean that all animals are

299
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,230
secretly just as intelligent as we are

300
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,209
but are unable to express themselves I

301
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,420
just became a vegan Charles Muntz was

302
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,009
able to invent talking dog collars in

303
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,540
video chat using technology from the

304
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,589
1940s where the fuck is this camera

305
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,360
located I just saw Doug a few minutes

306
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,889
ago but I don't remember seeing a camera

307
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,480
on top of his head which is what this

308
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,199
current shot would suggest a dog that's

309
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,550
lived in jungle isolation with his other

310
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,350
dog pals and one other human for his

311
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,240
entire life is aware that mailman exists

312
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,620
the house and the hose that connects

313
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,790
them to it aren't constantly getting

314
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,379
caught in tree branches and this

315
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,819
wouldn't even be a sin if they just

316
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,050
stayed on top of the cliff where there

317
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,699
are no trees but instead they keep

318
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,500
reappearing in this dense jungle they

319
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,850
shouldn't have access to

320
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,649
yep I'm gonna send the old pastime of a

321
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,879
cartoon character and possibly

322
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,990
transporting ahead of the other

323
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,819
characters it's what we do unfortunately

324
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,170
whoever gave Russell the tent building

325
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,029
patch that I'm sure he has will

326
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,230
hopefully be disbarred from the

327
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,910
wilderness explorer community there must

328
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,139
be something in the South American air

329
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,579
that allowed Russell's face to heal so

330
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,189
quickly

331
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,569
Carl's surprised that Russell says this

332
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:27,040
like it was something he and Elia made

333
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,600
up on their own and not something that

334
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,490
people have said for decades

335
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,759
[Music]

336
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,100
birds calling babies how do you know

337
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,930
that just because your dog doesn't mean

338
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,610
you speak fluent bird and he'll earlier

339
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,600
you said you didn't even know what a

340
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,339
bird looked like so I do ride your bird

341
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:47,139
understanding abilities you saw this

342
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,550
bird on this little videophone

343
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,230
thingamajig right who cares about what

344
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,910
he said months has been able to maintain

345
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,069
a dog army for the past 70 years or so

346
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,839
with presumably very little food and no

347
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,400
female dogs

348
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,070
Carles once yes if he's actually Charles

349
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,420
months that would mean that he's at

350
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,490
least 15 to 20 years older than Karl I

351
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,230
imagine Karl's in his late 70s which

352
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,820
would put Charles well into his 90s

353
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,830
which isn't impossible but I imagine it

354
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,790
would be hard to maintain your health

355
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,500
with just a bunch of dogs a finite

356
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,120
amount of food and no doctors I mean

357
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,830
he's never even had a prostate exam

358
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,420
months found a cave large enough to fit

359
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,870
his blimp what do they tell the dogs

360
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,070
they need to have operations when they

361
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,450
have to wear this count is it still the

362
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,830
cone of shame why not have a crate of

363
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,470
shame if he means FDR time-wise that

364
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,910
would make sense button having trouble

365
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,590
visualizing him on safari with the

366
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,700
president who was famously in a

367
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,440
wheelchair if not him and the only other

368
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,730
famous roosevelt would be theodore

369
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,500
roosevelt given theos interest in

370
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,030
big-game hunting it makes sense that he

371
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,470
would be referring to him but given that

372
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,660
he died in 1919 when months was either

373
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,190
not born or a small child that really

374
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:51,310
looks up the timeline the dog how does

375
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,560
he do anything either that's a 70 year

376
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,270
old frozen hot dog or he's making his

377
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,920
own hot dogs out of the local squirrels

378
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,810
there's also the dog army Russell's been

379
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,220
eating chocolate for two days and

380
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,720
somehow refrains from inhaling this hot

381
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,160
dog before this asshole has enough time

382
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
to take it off his plate more often I

383
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,940
get thieves come to steal what's

384
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,160
rightfully mine you do you mean there

385
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,630
are actual people out there making trips

386
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,010
to remote parts of South America to

387
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,680
steal you I've spent a lifetime tracking

388
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,810
it and Carl and Russell ran into it

389
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,160
within minutes of arriving at Paradise

390
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,460
Falls but it ran off it's gone now

391
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,410
Carl lies two months for Kevin even

392
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,700
though he's made it clear several times

393
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,110
that he doesn't care for the bird and he

394
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,610
knows months won't kill him because in

395
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,140
order to be vindicated he has to return

396
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,490
with the bird a lot Carl should know

397
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,930
that if he's just honest about the Kevin

398
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,430
months won't harm him or Russell if

399
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,630
anything he's just putting Russell on

400
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,520
himself in serious danger also human

401
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,720
children are more important than birds

402
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,279
why am i forced to explain this to Pixar

403
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,259
none of you have even had dinner yet the

404
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,790
old man in the outer shape child are

405
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,379
able to outrun a pack of dogs the house

406
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,360
survives this Doug uses his super

407
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,069
strength to push these boulders down to

408
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,680
block the pack of dogs now Russell

409
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,160
survives this dog helm screen so they

410
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,629
decided to get Kevin back to her home

411
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,490
but they decided to lug the house with

412
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,559
them but why couldn't you just tie this

413
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,059
thing somewhere then you wouldn't have

414
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,399
to haul it back either because the

415
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,230
squirrel gets dead all the dogs have an

416
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,819
extreme hatred for squirrels yet we

417
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,170
haven't seen a single squirrel since

418
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,699
we've been in Paradise Falls at least

419
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,139
not since months got the hot dog machine

420
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,970
up and running not only of the balloons

421
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,529
stayed inflated for two to three days

422
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,240
now but they continued to not get popped

423
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,319
by branches haha funny joke but this

424
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:26,819
jungle has been anything but wild since

425
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,350
they got here they ran into one rare

426
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,059
bird and a bunch of trained dogs not in

427
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,499
their natural habitat and nothing else

428
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:33,120
even with all their treacherous detours

429
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,680
they still made it to the falls side of

430
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,149
the cliff just as the balloons ran out

431
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,589
of lift on some of these pictures Carl

432
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,059
flips through an Ellie scrapbook I can

433
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,069
honestly say where is camera yep telling

434
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,839
me they set up a delay on a camera and

435
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,850
got these candid shots or did they have

436
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,290
a photographer constantly following them

437
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,029
around if they trim the professional

438
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,379
photographer budget they probably could

439
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,550
have eked out a trip to Paradise Falls

440
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,620
upon further examination of Ellie's

441
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,689
chair I deem it unsuitable an old man

442
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:55,980
who needs a machine to go down the

443
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,149
stairs is able to throw all his

444
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:00,149
furniture out the front door Doug the

445
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,059
dog knows how to knock under your porch

446
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,589
is there some sort of magical alcove

447
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,540
under Carl's porch that allows dogs and

448
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,860
children to hide down there and then

449
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,329
move onto the porch while the house is

450
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,920
in the air Russell has Superman flight

451
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,449
powers with a leaf blower where he's

452
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,250
able to will himself forward even though

453
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,959
the leaf blower only blows at one speed

454
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,850
also how does he keep from continuing to

455
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,129
float upward yeah because you totally

456
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,360
figured out that he found a way to make

457
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,740
his house fly again even though he's

458
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,819
been hauling it around for the last

459
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:28,949
couple days Carl slings a hose and gets

460
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,600
the sprayer to grab on to the cargo door

461
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,649
on the first try

462
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,269
then he zip lines down at like it's

463
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,079
second nature we get past these dogs how

464
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,670
do they not smell your prune and denture

465
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,209
cream scent

466
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,040
Oh what were the other dog the dogs can

467
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,629
cook a gourmet meal and tie a human boy

468
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:44,490
to a chair but still need a chew toy to

469
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,589
fire a gun on a biplane okay I've been

470
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,240
pretty forgiving of Carl's super old

471
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,679
person abilities but I'm gonna have to

472
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,000
draw the line at climbing an upside-down

473
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,439
ladder and almost falling off but

474
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,819
catching himself I

475
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,290
movie continues it's needless assault on

476
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,360
squirrels also the dogs never get picked

477
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,129
up after this battle is over so I can

478
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,329
only assume they live the rest of their

479
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,980
lives starving in the Venezuelan jungle

480
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,329
I don't know too much about the

481
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,009
originals but I would imagine having a

482
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,389
house on the back would screw with the

483
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,949
balance and create an issue also it

484
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,899
looks like Carl the normal old man is

485
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,279
able to stop the house from sliding off

486
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,019
the back of it I put more faith in the

487
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,639
house ripping Carl's arms off before I

488
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,929
believe any of this I'm seeing right now

489
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,429
that guy falling to his death because

490
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:19,720
showing him died any other way it would

491
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,100
be too gruesome for kids movie cliche

492
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,839
nice transition but allow me to be a

493
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,339
dick for a moment because that means

494
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,689
they would have had to be in the exact

495
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,129
same position and do the exact same

496
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,869
things twice for this to be possible

497
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:33,249
yep I'm a dick you know yeah he clearly

498
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,779
doesn't need a cane did you see all the

499
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,790
people in the last scene will graduate

500
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,519
to senior explorers why do all these

501
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,259
kids get to graduate the senior explorer

502
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,910
they don't have all the badges man

503
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,589
Russell's mom was super okay with her

504
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:45,759
son being gone for three or four days

505
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,379
when continuing to let Russell see the

506
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,730
man the courts say is a menace to

507
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,470
society and is responsible for her kid

508
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,939
being gone in the first place I wonder

509
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:53,079
how much trouble Carl will get in with

510
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,999
the FAA for perking an unlicensed 60

511
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,259
year old airship above an ice cream

512
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,759
store you mean to tell me the house

513
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,069
landed ripe gah forget these end credits

514
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:06,660

[Applause]

517
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,800
[Music]

518
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,750
humility before nature it's being

519
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,160
displayed here on staggers believe me

520
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,380
just wait till they get a look at you

521
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:33,370
will they get a load of me

522
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,500
what kind of dining set defines me as a

523
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,250
person

524
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,650
