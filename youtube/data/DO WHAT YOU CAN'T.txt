learn to compromise this is terrible

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,190
advice if I were writing an

autobiography a book about my life one

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,929
title that would work with these do what

12
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,510
you can't because that idea encapsulate

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,359
everything I've ever done like what I

14
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,710

20
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,949
and egotism for going about it

21
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,400
characterize what this new generation of

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,460
content creators and filmmaker what we

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,010
all do on YouTube everywhere else we do

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:21,730

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,250
characters jump off some buildings and

28
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,280
you can write Devon yes you can have a

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,530

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,320

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,300
first youtube video and our next thing

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,140

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,380
president

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,630

00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,220
gear you don't need trucks or a crane

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,840
you don't need some big expensive camera

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,570
rig than everyone when you're a creator

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,010
