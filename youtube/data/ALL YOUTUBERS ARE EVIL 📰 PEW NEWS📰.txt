Pew News intro.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,300
A lot of YouTube drama this week

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,860
so much controversy and

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,500
finally not anything about that stupid potty mouth foul

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,380
YouTuber Swede PewDiePie,

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,360
Please stop mixing me up with him.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,900
Ok, I'm Gloryaia Brogerr

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,640
Reputable news journalist.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
Our first news comes from Australia

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,300
From Pogo

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,400
you guys know Pogo?

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,600
he makes these sort of music remixes on

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,320
On YouTube

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,680
as Disney mashups type of stuff

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,340
maybe you watch it but let's give it a little taste

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:01,120
(Said video plays)

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,600
Full disclosure guys. Of course

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
here on Pew News.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,240
Of Course, I'm gonna be a hundred percent honest

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,020
I'm a big fan of Pogo's music.

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,160
I think like ... pogo's music.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,920
(laughs)

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,220
I've listened to that his album weightless countless times,

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,120
It's so good

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,320
(The said album plays)

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
I love it so much two things that I know about pogo that I never really process number one

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,940
His username is I've noticed that if you go on pogo's YouTube channel page the URL that links to it is F A G

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,900
O T  T A R O N I've seen that before and I thought way that's a bit strange

32
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,580
Is it because he made his channel in 2007? He was a lot younger back then and had a

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:58,770
Silly childish sense of humor and never really bothered to change it or is it because he actually hates gay people

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,550
Well Pogo decided to answer that question. I

35
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,010
came up with  F***Tron because

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,940
I've always had a very thorough

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,560
dislike of

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,620
Homosexuals to put this in context he makes these live streams where he does random stuff

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,690
Like he explained he randomly meditating or not doing anything

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,360
to dumbfound people

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,989
I'm guessing he thought it was so obvious that he's not a homophobe that he could make this sort of joke satiring homophobes

42
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,769
cause that's really what it is. He's trying he said he's trying to do satire and it's too

43
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,860
Real if you don't know Pogo if you don't know

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,940
His type of humor and you see this sort of clip coming out of nowhere

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,910
obviously a lot of people think it's real and

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:55,100
Therefore it gets reported as such by the verge for example saying Disney remix of Pogo can't walk back on his homophobic comments

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,459
There's so many articles reporting this now and I think a lot of people know as well that it is satire

48
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,000
He was trying to make a joke

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,750
But it really doesn't matter at this point because if you get to that level

50
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,640
It's just going to keep going. I understand if people are upset about these kind of thing, but I think this comment I found

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,380
encapsulates the situation

52
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,310
Perfectly great joke Pogo. I found it really funny how you said you hated a whole group of people for something

53
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,610
They can't control have fun with your ruined career. It's basically saying I know you're joking. I don't care if you're joking

54
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,560
Enjoy having your career ruined and it's so pity to me to just ignore the fact that if someone is joking or not

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Even if it was a bad joke or even if it didn't really line with a lot of people just ignoring that completely

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,640
It seems dishonest and vicious

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,250
Which I guess is kind of a hypocritical in

58
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,500
A way to say I don't know the thing is pogo made an apology and it's so bad it is

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,739
ughh Pogo!

60
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,610
PoNo! Damn it! Oh dear. Oh dear the controversy. I have sparked whatever I

61
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,870
what have I done my goodness? Okay, I get it. He's not really apologizing

62
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,720
He's not backing down on his belief and in a lot of ways. I can respect that

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,930
But he also used to have in a description of this video

64
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,790
explaining that he's I don't know if you even had Asperger or some form of autism and

65
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:25,930
that he struggled with empathy for people and I think he wanted to make this joke without realizing that yes, it could actually

66
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,430
Have a negative impact on a lot of people at least then I understand sort of how this situation occurred

67
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,520
I understand how he thinks and what he's trying to accomplish

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,530
instead in this video

69
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:44,320
He goes on a very anti PC rant and I'm all for that but in the right time guys in the right time

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,190
Don't go spouting about Peterson and all these right-wing

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,110
Politicians I'm getting so tired of social politics like two weeks ago. I'm like, yeah

72
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,380
Everyone's a hypocrite and I feel I feel him I get it. There's so much hypocrisy in social politics

73
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,750
He's making fun of homophobes. But instead he gets labeled as one who's right and wrong. I don't know

74
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,250
I'm so lost and just like oh god, I don't know. I think it's a shame. He's clearly

75
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,540
Oh, he even said himself that he's you know struggled with his own sexuality

76
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,800
Not really saying too much, but you know, what do you guys think is he right or is it wrong?

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,660
(meme review)

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:18,669
Another homophobe on YouTube god dammit. There's so many of them who's next? Mr. Beast? I knew it. I knew it

79
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:26,100
Another homophobe on YouTube god dammit. There's so many of them who's next. Mr. Beast. I knew it. I knew it

80
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,629
I knew it What did he say? What foul thing? Did he say now?

81
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,400
Okay can possibly be worse than Pogo. &quot;Windows is gay&quot;

82
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,820
(silence)

83
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,639
This is absolutely outrageous, thank you the Atlantic

84
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,419
For digging deep in mr. Beast's Twitter

85
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,360
Exposing him for he true who he truly is how dare he speak of Windows in such a negative light

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,389
Thank You the Atlantic for doing the work the good work of the people

87
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,319
I always had my doubts but finally someone could uncover this truth

88
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,680
Now this article is a lot easier to just break down as trying to paint. Mr. Beast in the worst light

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,500
The headline says YouTube's biggest philanthropist has history of homophobic comments. I wouldn't really call Mr. Beast the

90
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,509
Philanthropist no offense, mr. Beast

91
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,020
uh

92
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,039
It's like they're setting him up to knock him down the Jesus of me of YouTube the Jesus Christ of YouTube

93
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,699
Is actually Satan guys. Listen to this. He said Windows is gay guys. He can't do that

94
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:39,349
He can't just do that. What else did he say? I don't have a printer f**

95
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,300
The homophobia runs deep in the YouTube community

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,330
*rolling eyes*

97
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,870
Okay, it's very similar to the Vice article

98
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,909
You're just looking to paint someone in a negative light for the sake of clicks

99
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:59,780
And for the sake of making youtubers look bad because obviously the media is gonna benefit from that you have this new platform

100
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,349
uh

101
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:05,770
Taking over for almost everything, you know, they're losing numbers. We're gaining numbers

102
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,969
So if they can make youtubers look bad and if they can generate clicks at the same time, obviously

103
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:17,379
It's a win-win situation for them. Even if I hate using the word, but Millennials call them out on it. It doesn't really matter

104
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:24,339
Why didn't you tell me you were homophobic when you donated 6000 to me and my lesbian partner two months ago. That's right. Mr

105
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:30,259
Beast huh? The thing here that I find so ridiculous is the fact that

106
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:35,289
Taylor the person who wrote this article clearly dug deep into mr

107
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:41,700
Beast's Twitter these sort of comments were made years ago, but if you go into Taylor said Twitter

108
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,240
She created it in 2010 despite very curiously she only has five hundred tweets

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,830
570 tweets and the first tweet she ever made was in February the February 1st this year

110
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,830
Hmm.. So what are you hiding Taylor Laurens? Why are you deleting your tweets?

111
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,100
(e x p o s e d)

112
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,180
anyone can play this game where you dig deep in someone's Twitter and find something that you can take out of context or or take

113
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,379
At face value and say hey, we got you. You said this you used this word. It's just so ridiculous. It's the same thing when

114
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,650
uh

115
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,620
Wall Street Journal article came out about me and one of the

116
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,760
Journalists, that wrote the article made very similar jokes to what I had made

117
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,150
uh

118
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,260
on his own Twitter if you have more than a couple thousand subscribers, make sure you delete all your old tweets because

119
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,280
on his own Twitter if you have more than a couple thousand subscribers, make sure you delete all your tweets because

120
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,920
uh

121
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,400
Apparently it will blow back at you in the future

122
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,410
PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW

123
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,200
PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEW

124
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,260
(clap clap clap)

125
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,520
???

126
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:43,650
Zoella and Alfie are getting called out by the BBC it just keeps going it just keeps going

127
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,420
so dumb

128
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:52,650
BBC spends times writing this YouTube stars might encourage kids to eat more calories. Oh, no

129
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:59,420
Because Zoella posted oh how I will miss all the amazing bakeries and ice cream shops when we get home

130
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,920
how dare Zoella pose with an ice cream, how dare she

131
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,360
Disgusting despicable she deserves to get called out

132
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm so not supposed to say my own opinion Gloria Borger here, but man

133
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,140
How could she I'm trying to understand where they I don't know why I put on my headphones

134
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,150
Then I'm just gonna keep them on shut up walk me through this cuz I don't get it

135
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,239
okay, so they did a study in the your

136
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:26,940
um

137
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,540
percentage of the european congress of obesity where they took

138
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,690
Social media stars like Zoella and Alfie Deyes

139
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,660
And they took their followers on instagram and then they took hundred and seventy-six children

140
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,760
They split him into three groups and shown pictures of Zoella eating healthy snacks

141
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,720
Zoella eating unhealthy snacks or

142
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Non-food products then they took the childrens and offering a range of healthy and unhealthy snacks between grapes and

143
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,660
carrots sticks

144
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:04,910
Chocolate buttons and jelly sweets and they found that the children who had seen Zoella eating unhealthy snacks

145
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,620
consumed

146
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,620
448 calories while the healthy snacks consumed

147
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,660
357 calories.

148
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,460
Are you actually fucking retarded?

149
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,920
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is this study!? It's so dumb!

150
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,460
*SILENCED SCREAMING*

151
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,620
This can't be real!? So you showed pictures

152
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,290
Okay, let's just remove Zoella out of the picture

153
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,187
So you showed pictures of a person eating healthy foods

154
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,400
and then you showed picture of someone eating unhealthy foods

155
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,560
So that was you where you got out of it was the fact that

156
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,340
people that ate unhealthy foods

157
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,380
consumed more calories.

158
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,140
?‍♂️?‍♂️

159
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,069
Wait

160
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,940
?‍♂️?‍♂️

161
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,020
I'm trying to understand

162
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,800
all you're doing here is proving that youtubers has influence

163
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,920
All you're doing here is proving that youtubers has influenced if someone poses with healthy foods, yes

164
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,248
If someone poses with healthy foods,

165
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:02,600
yes you're gonna be drawn to that product

166
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,020
if someone poses with

167
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,240
Unhealthy foods. Yes, people are gonna be drawn to that products

168
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,220
because people look up to youtubers. They're influencers.

169
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,040
That's how it works.

170
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,290
If she Zoella wants to pose a picture with an ice cream she has every right to do so

171
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,090
This is so pathetic

172
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,440
and also they're painting YouTube in a bad light when really

173
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,560
they're using Instagram and Twitter as an example and the BBC, you know

174
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,240
which in UK is paid through TV licence

175
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,380
So if you have a TV you have to pay TV licence that money goes into funding BBC

176
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,920
So of course BBC has to benefit from making YouTube look bad because more and more people are consuming

177
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,040
because more and more people are consuming

178
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,540
uh

179
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,620
entertainment through YouTube

180
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,700
Instead of paying their TV licence.

181
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,180
Me for example, I don't pay my TV licence because I don't use television.

182
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,600
So BBC is losing money

183
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,360
from me because of that and I think I can only imagine that numbers gonna grow more and

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,370
More as more and more people stop consuming

185
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,640
more as more and more people stop consuming

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,140
uh

187
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,060
Entertainment through the BBC and TV or whatever like it's not even worth talking about at this point

188
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,160
Like it's not even worth talking about at this point

189
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,660
uh

190
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,180
I'm seriously considering if I should just stop doing pew news

191
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,880
cuz it's so dumb everything I talk about it's just dumb

192
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,780
I don't care. I genuinely don't care.

193
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,729
This videos is just going to get demonetized

194
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,180
like I'm just getting

195
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,480
could just be playing some random fucking Minecraft game and

196
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,180
Make more revenue instead of talking about these things. Why why?

197
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,280
I'm tired. I'm tired of all of it. I'm done

198
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,600
I'm done.

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,500
This is it.

200
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,560
This is the last pew news. Goodbye. I'm Gloria Borger. I'm officially retiring. Goodbye

201
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,060
I'm-

202
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,040
*Static*

203
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,140
RIP PEW News

204
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,660

Gotta get to the 13:00 mark tho.

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,000
Gotta get to the 13:00 mark tho.
