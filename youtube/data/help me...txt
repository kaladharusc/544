1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,610
hey guys what's up sweet

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,910
go back to another video today we have

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,740
something a little bit different and no

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,370
this is not that's it's not an ad it's

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,260
really not I'm actually doing this

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,280
just because I've been playing this

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,330
application on the phone it's red dot I

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,060
thought I saw a red dot it's an

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,850
application on the phone called a very

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,809
dice basically an application on your

11
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:40,040
phone that allows you to win stuff by

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,900
just rolling dice and getting tickets

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,000
from rolling the dice it's a pretty

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,700
simple concept but you can actually win

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,880
 on the application and that's what

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,940
makes it so freaking addiction

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,380
addictions addictions on it's addicting

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,540
it's its addicting because you can

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,070
literally like basically get anything

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,930
off Amazon you just have to have a

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,990
certain amount of tickets and how to get

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,670
tickets you have to get rolls and you

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,100
have to roll the dice and it's it's

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,170
pretty interesting it's pretty fun but

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,380
you know I got an unboxing video to do

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,260
today from something that I won from

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,770
very dice I'm lying this actually my

28
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,340
girlfriend my fiancee she won this on

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,650
her very dice she's been playing it for

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,150
a long time now and she's won multiple

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,830
things and I haven't even won one thing

32
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,060
so that's why I'm making this video

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,070
because she gets referrals and I don't

34
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,979
get referrals so seriously download the

35
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,500
app and and you know golden bye my

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,619
friend code if you put in my friend code

37
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,979
I believe we both get stuff on the

38
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,320
application that will help us receive

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,450
stuff and I'm trying to win some stuff

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,409
that I like without having to spend

41
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,860
money I mean I could it'd be a lot

42
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,350
easier but I mean who doesn't like to

43
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,570
play a game and win I mean that

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,860
that's the main reason why I'm doing

45
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,259
this I want to win stuff I want to win

46
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,769
