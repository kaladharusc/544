Alright, a little pro tip for Mark here

41
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,440
This clip, I know, another company owns

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,060
So if Mark shows this clip,

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,160
that company is going to claim the revenue of this entire video

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,420
Which means, Mark, you're potentially losing 15,000 dollars on this video

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,740
So already I know Mark doesn't care about money

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,980
Which means I'm not gonna watch his clips! Right?

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,620
Damn it, Jack! Damn it!

163
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,560
Alright fine, one point to Jack

164
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,120
See if I care, Jack!

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,720
Jack: Shit, no! (Wtf is this)

166
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,320
Maybe he laughs, maybe he laughs

167
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,380
Jack: I hate this! (So does everyone else)

168
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,480
Jack: Why- No, I hate this.

169
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,440
Jack: It was supposed to be funniest home videos

170
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,105
Jack: Why are you guys sending me this creepy sSSHHHII

171
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:58,085
Also, edit out Jack's swear there

172
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,120
I don't know why you can sink so low

173
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,020
To swear on your videos (HMmmMmMMm)

174
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,140
Jack, you have kids watching

175
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Jack: Jacksepticeye ignores crying fan? (Please no)

176
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,640
*chuckles

177
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,760
Jack: Oh no-

178
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,620
Are you kidding me?

179
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,840
Are you kidding me?

180
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
Goddamn it

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,720
*laughs*

182
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Just reading the title made me laugh

183
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,080
Jack: -gonna be really cringey, isn't it?

184
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,200
Jack: Oh god, dogby, what did you do?

185
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,700
Man: Adele, the singer, has over 16 million subscribers

186
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,960
Jack: Is this when I was on the late late show earlier in the-

187
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,260
That does not count by the way (It does count shh)

188
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,000
'Cos the video hasn't started

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,480
Man: -cos you're about to meet, an Irish fella, has over 18 subscribers (18? wow)

190
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,680
*Crowd awes and claps*
*Jack laughs*

191
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Jack: GreenPewdiepie420

192
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,500
Jack: That's good. He has over *eighteen* subscribers

193
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,460
Man: -has over 18 subscribers

194
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,360
Alright we both failed

195
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Man: This, is what he does

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,980
*Jack inside of Jack's video screaming and both Pewds and Jack chuckles*

197
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Jack: He's not wrong, it is what I do

198
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,545
Man: Alright, you might not have heard of him, but to millions

199
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,505
Man: he's kind of a big deal. Can we give him a welcome please, to Sean McLoughlin,

200
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:06,560
Man: also known as, Jacksepticeye! (Green PewDiePie*) Ladies and gentl-

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,760
*loud footsteps in the silent room* *PewDiePie laughs*

203
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,900
Jack: Oh, that's so good!

204
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,760
Jack: oh nooo

205
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,960
This is- This is how it looks like when I get interviewed

206
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,060
Jack: Haha, it's so awkward!

207
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,720
*so silent that you can hear the crowd's chattering*

208
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,860
Jack: Oh it gonna end

209
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,740
Jack: no! Ffuuuu**

210
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,600
Man: And here Adam Mooney sits here. Hi Adam!

211
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Adam: Hi

212
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,760
Jack: Pfft, shut up to say hi

213
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,540
Man: You're 14, you're from Wicklow, and you have a question

214
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,360
Boy: Uh yeah, do you have any advice on like people starting a channel

215
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,560
Boy: like how to get more subscriber- subscribers to their channel?

216
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,340
Jack in suit: I don't know if I should say it or not

217
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,980
Man: You can try

218
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,180
Jack: Uh no, I keep it under rafts (Rafts? idk)

219
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,000
Man: Ok

Jack: Oh, this is so well edited
Man: Hey Jayman, how are you?

221
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,080
*Girl sobbing*

222
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,280
Jack: awww

223
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,520
Jack: oh no

224
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,660
What is this ad!

225
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,600
Jack: Oh no...!

226
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,520
Jack: No, that's not me! (It is you)

227
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
This is just too painful!

228
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
I can't

229
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,860
Can't believe you did that, Jack

230
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,920
Oh, that's funny

231
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,860
It's fun laughing with other people. I actually like this, tee ha

232
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,200
I think I understand why you guys click on these videos now

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,460
Jack: See if you'll laugh at this

234
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,160
Jack: I don't even know how you make these,

235
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,440
Jack: these are always super impressive (ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT)

236
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
Are you kidding me Jack?

237
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,460
Grandayy, I love you, but these are not hard to edit

238
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,200
Jack: It's also-

239
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,380
Why the ad!

240
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,740
Oh my god, Jack! Goddamn it! (It happens to the best of us)

241
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,340
Jack: -so long

242
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,940
Jack: and it just keeps going and going

243
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,340
And then where's the punchline?

244
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,140
It's never funny

245
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,020
Africa *Toto Africa plays*

246
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,920
Tada, ok, great

247
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,360
Man: All the sign says that it's

248
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,500
Man: four quarters for an hour but

249
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,100
Man: a quarter only gets you fifteen minutes (Hmmm)

250
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,480
Man: so if my math is correct, that's not an hour

251
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,440
15 minutes isn't an hour?

252
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,100
Jack: Oh no

253
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,120

Man: Take that off, take that off (Poor guy)

256
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,980
Man: You're right, 15 minutes is a qua-

257
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,880
Man: God, I do not do drugs, I have not have liquor

258
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,360
Man: My friends are leaving me...

259
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,700
Jack: Oh, that poor man!

260
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,580
Reporter: -news stories about they want to change the parking-

261
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,740
Man: Please don't put that on...

262
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,180
Jack: Aw, that poor man! Noo!
*Pewds laughs*

263
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,620
Wait, did I laugh or not. Jack, damn it!

264
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,360
Goddamn you and your empathy, Jack!

265
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,180
Fine! You win this round

266
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,680
But next time I'll get you, Jack

267
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,520
Smash like once if you beat- uh, Mark (Like the video!)

268
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,140
Smash like twice if you beat me (Doesn't that unlike the video?)

269
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,680
Smash like three times and subscribe if you beat all of us (Subscribe anyway :))

270
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,000
Skratta du, flörlar du

271
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,420
YouTube's.... show, everybody

272
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,880
And I'll see you next time, bye!

273
00:10:45,880 --> 00:11:03,725
I need to get on hand- a video, so that's why I shot this video, I'm sorry....

274
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,000
(Bye all!)
