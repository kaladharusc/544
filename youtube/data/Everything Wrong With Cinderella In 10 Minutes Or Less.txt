RKO Pictures there are actually several

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,550
things wrong with that but mainly radio

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,089
pictures books reading narration of

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,920
reading this is the calmest happy dog

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,960
I've ever seen are we sure he's not dead

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,000
also evil stepmother is so evil it makes

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,380
you wonder which dude was able to get it

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,210
up for her to produce two daughters but

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,859
the stepmothers true nature was revealed

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,199
you mean evilly stroking a cat with a

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,670
perpetual scowl on her face didn't tip

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,600
that off ever bird Butler's alarm clock

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,620
Birds these birds are dicks can't tell

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,440
cuz if you tell a wish it won't come

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,950
true our dreams wishes dammit there's a

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,660
song for this oh look there's a mouse

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,910

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,410
get bird and mouse droppings on her

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,199
sheets and bedding yeah let's blame the

21
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,640
clock when it was a couple of birds that

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,260
woke you up sure is lucky that these are

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,730
the nice kind of mice or else this might

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,439
be considered an infestation other than

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,000
her singing which is fair are these

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,799
animals compensated in any way for doing

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,000
so much of the work for her morning

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,950
routine disappointing sponge baths look

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,180
fun for the whole family aside

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,920
Cinderella appears to have zero side

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,659
boob in this shot you might think I have

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,520
a need to see cartoon nudity I don't I

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,990
saw heavy metal and it's like jacking

34
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,790
off to crayons my point is if you're

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,990
gonna have a scene like this you can't

36
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,490
pretend Cinderella's chest is made up of

37
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,939
a solid black line Mouse undergarments

38
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:34,049
well that makes 167 then house plays the

39
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,520
pronoun game with Cinderella Cinderella

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,409
assumes she for some reason because this

41
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,939
game is awesome green cloaked Mouse

42
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,680
flashes Cinderella to emphasize the

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,479
mouse's a heat which I don't know how

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
that communicates gender but I guess

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,270
that's how it was done in 1954 sure

46
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,670
we'll call you Gus how is Gus short for

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,350
Octavius we were told the house had

48
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,850
fallen into disrepair after Cinderella's

49
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,380
dad died but it looks pretty damn good

50
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,940
for disrepair

51
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,250
come here they named the cat Lucifer

52
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,020
that's not a nickname either they

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,090
actually named the cat Lucifer also cats

54
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,470
aren't known to come when called by name

55
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,510
or even understand their own names like

56
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,830
if your cat is named pretty you could

57
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,020
also call kitty titty years and have the

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,340
same odds of that cat coming to you

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,980
anyway I digress so what you don't want

60
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,950
to lose a nice warm bed you'd better get

61
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,170
rid of those dreams but a dream is a

62
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,400
wish that your heart makes Cinderella

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,470
most cats are lactose intolerant so even

64
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,850
if you're serving an evil cat this is

65
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,690
not a good idea these mice only know one

66
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,160
way out of the castle apparently story

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,390
of Cinderella becomes a Tom and Jerry

68
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,460
cartoon there is no reason to get this

69
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,990
close to a cat you're trying to distract

70
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,730
and lure away from the door wig

71
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,740
none at all Cinderella is feeding three

72
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,060
different species the same kind of food

73
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,880
strike that four species cheese overdose

74
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,830
stupidest Mouse in history somehow fails

75
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,270
to grab a single piece of food despite

76
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,530
having started out next to a fucking

77
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,540
pile of that then Cinderella over feeds

78
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,160
Gus four times his bodyweight like she's

79
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,950
the killer in seven what a dumbass damn

80
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,750
this big-ass evil cat gets knocked out

81
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,310
by things normal cats would either avoid

82
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,750
or get hit by and run into five

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,220
different rooms before stopping that's

84
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,000
not possible

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,140
what the hell kind of breakfast is this

86
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,660
hot water a teacup no sugar or cream or

87
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,130
lemon or anything at all to put in the

88
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,900
tea hell I don't even actually see any

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,209
teabags and then we have what chicken

90
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,739
broth foreshadowing it's hard to believe

91
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,570
an hour and 14 minute movie had so

92
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,160
little story that it needed this much

93
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,750
Mouse plot this is not where the hole

94
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,130
was before if you want to say it's so

95
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,750
dark I can't see the stepmother fine

96
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,400
just don't tell me it lights up like

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,260
magic I don't know where what stepmother

98
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,970
must keep that crane by her bed because

99
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,230
it wasn't on the trees Cinderella was

100
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,820
carrying which means it's spoiled and

101
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,010
gross all the eligible maid

102
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,329
I happened to be there why palms are so

103
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:46,030
interesting isn't it well this is gay

104

night

105
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,390
how long have you known your son is

106
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,159
coming home you're just now thinking of

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,599
arranging a ball on the day he's coming

108
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,230
back

109
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,700
Cinderella leaves a pile of dirt in the

110
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,379
dustpan just lying around so that evil

111
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:04,040
cats can perform mischief the animation

112
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,150
sequence and this is awesome

113
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,189
and the song is pretty but damn it has

114
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,140
four words in the entire song repeated

115
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,400
over and over mice openly walk around in

116
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,540
the main part of the house knowing full

117
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,889
well there are four living things who

118
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,209
hate them here and could discover them

119
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:25,220
at any time what's this we hear about

120
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,480

122

stepsister ex machina this movie should

123
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,710
just be called mice they're able to get

124
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,690
on these beads using this tiny sack and

125
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,669
Gus's tail I counted them that's more

126
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:44,570
than 40 here

127
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,130
I'm calling bullshit on cartoon logic

128
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,810
over a minute and a half of Bert Mouse

129
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,789
dressmaking I would removed all the sins

from this movie plus any remaining ones

131
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,940
left in the feature if the needle had

132
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,900
stabbed this mouse in the head

133
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,699
apparently even in whatever castle era

when his sudden person appears fairy

138
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,150
godmothers must be pretty damn common I

139
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,500
guess Hogwarts is right around the

140
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,210
corner it also explains why a Gryffindor

141
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,630
ended up in the Slytherin house at some

142
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,800
points in Duralast I wonder why the

143
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,330
fairy godmother waited until some ball

144
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,160
to show up and offer help after like a

145

lifetime of torture and abuse this

146
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
nonsensical alliteration works to turn

147

pumpkins into carriages mice and horses

148
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,310
and horses into people I don't know how

149
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,960
the words know how to change what into

150
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,849
what but it sure is catchy also fairy

151
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,199
godmother creates a world where if

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,220
Cinderella fell in love with her

153

coachman she technically be falling in

154
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,970
love with a horse no judgments I'm just

155
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,139
saying that's the world we're living in

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,710
what a dick this dude is I can't decide

168
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,210
if this guy has too many guards or too

169
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,279
many stairs he stops

170
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,129
looks the day I accept narration from an

171
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,719
asshole wearing a monocle that's the day

172
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:20,599
I give up cinema sentence the good he

173
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,039
can tell that Cinderella is awesome from

174
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,210
this distance because in all the

175
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,919
kingdoms she's the only blonde at least

176
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,059
she's the only blond with those kind of

177
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:29,479
birthing hips oh by the way my name is

178
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,279
Cinderella I know it's awkward when you

179
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,360
just start dancing and don't even

180
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,399
introduce yourself or speak perfect

181
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,539
people rarely need to do that after two

182
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,309
minutes well I don't know where the fuck

183
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,259
we are now but maybe Elrond will show us

184
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,469
the way out of here by morning but

185
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,909
you're in love that's for sure that's

186
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,379
the disadvantage of the start dancing

187
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,389
and never talk method of courtship um no

188
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,999
it was midnight 75 seconds ago that's in

189
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,800
movie time too if it's still midnight

190
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,149
then why is my mo quite turning into a

191
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,129
gremlin so easily I knew I shouldn't

192
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,330
trust town clocks when it came to

193
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,559
late-night feedings so why did

194
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,789
everything turn back to normal but the

195
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,349
slipper she lost remains it's beautiful

196
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,300
glass self it makes me wonder if she had

197
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,069
bibbidi-bobbidi-boo the prince with all

198
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,149
the clothes on the ground of state

199
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,039
bibbidi-bobbidi-boo no that's not what

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,120
it looked like when she changed back

201
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,309
take that hard-working animators thank

202
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,909
you so much thanks for showing up after

203
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,830
17 years of my life at least 10 of them

204
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,360
under the horrible rule of my stepmother

205
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,009
to give me 3 hours of magic that you

206
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,419
could easily have adjusted to 2:00 or

207
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,279
3:00 a.m. because your magic this king

208
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,749
is upset at the duke scene is just plain

209
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,279
stupid and doesn't belong in this movie

210
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:38,509
okay I said it and should and it's crazy

211
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,189
it doesn't by the way the other way you

212
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,479
could figure out who the slipper belongs

213
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,399
to is to find the one blond girl in the

214
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,839
entire kingdom the Princess Bride

215
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,089
I love that movie oh wait Cinderella is

216
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,800
now under such a spell she gives clues

217
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,089
to her stepmother that she was the

218
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,409
princess dance partner from last night

219
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,360
although let's be honest she could have

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,979
already known due to I don't know her

221
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,569
appearance many famous people have

222
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,069
stayed in this castle in olden times

223
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:04,729
including

224
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,319
Abraham Lincoln evil stepmother in

225
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,059
ridiculously lucky fashion aimlessly

226
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,800
props herself in perfect my stealing

227
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,139
keys position what mice have x-ray

228
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,379
vision now proclamation about a fucking

229
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,909
shoe fitting is so long it allows the

230
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,589
mice to do this stepmother doesn't

231
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,389
notice a giant mouse in the saucer t

232
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,069
drop defies the laws of gravity if you

233
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,240
cut all the mouse footage out of this

234
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,009
movie you'd literally be left with a 14

235
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,569
minute short film look don't put a

236
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,830
situation in a movie that is this

237
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,360
impossible with the time given and then

238
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,559
tell me Cinderella gets out of her damn

239
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,180
room before the Duke leaves and the mice

240
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,829
climb all this way in the time it takes

241
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:35,389
for the lone remaining sister to try on

242
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,889
the shoe mice have sudden forks and

243
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,000
scissors all over their home to go

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
attack the cat with no wonder this dude

245
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,880
has been out this all night he spends

246
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,529
ten minutes with each girl trying to jam

247
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,909
on a shoe that obviously doesn't fit

248
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,800
fitting in for the cat if he shows up

249
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,269
alive at any point we'll know he was

250
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:52,250
buried in the pet cemetery I know

251
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,320
terrible how they can only settle this

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,639
with a shoe fitting and not any other

253
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,860
aspects of her features terrible huh she

254
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,089
never once said her name so that this

255
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,470
was the only way they could find her but

256
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,570
you see I have the other slipper

257
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,040
now there's no way to verify that the

258
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,449
slipper is the same size as the one that

259
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,070
broke but I guess these are the only

260
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,690
glass slippers ever made because they

261
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,490
would be uncomfortable if in real life

262
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,579
foot fetish yeah we're married what's
