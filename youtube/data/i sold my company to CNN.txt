1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,940
so maybe you've heard the news by now

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,610
but yesterday we announced that I sold

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,439
my technology company beam to CNN and

4
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,930
with CNN and my team at beam and my

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,910
partner Matt Hackett we're gonna be

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,279
starting a new like media and technology

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,789
company it's a very big deal it's a very

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,279
big announcement and I wanted to explain

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,770
to you as much of it as I can in a

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,930
YouTube video so this video is going to

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,040
be I sold my company told in five parts

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,690
okay part one the blog a question I've

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,980
been asked a million times since

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,649
yesterday is this why I killed the vlog

15
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,320
is this why I stopped blogging and the

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,100
answer is yes and no I was genuinely

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,500
bored I was exhausted and creatively

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,539
depleted when it came to making that

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,489
blog and I felt that way for the last

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,010
several months and the reason why I kept

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,750
going is because I wasn't entirely sure

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,990
what to do next so I would have stepped

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,820
away from the vlog regardless I don't

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,080
know what else I would have stepped into

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,479
and this opportunity definitely provided

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
me with the the catalyst to actually

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,880
shut the vlog down again just as a

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,659
caveat

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm not vlogging I'm still youtubing

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,189
very very much so if you didn't see the

31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,259
video I posted two days ago from Vietnam

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,860
check it out took me three weeks to make

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,689
I'm gonna make a whole video about what

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,520
it means to be an entrepreneur and what

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,100
my experience was like but I couldn't

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,890
make this video without talking about

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,390
fear I've done so many scary things in

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,939
my life jumping out of airplanes

39
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,469
helicopters over Afghanistan is in

40
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:58,289
there is nothing I've ever done that has

41
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,929
scared me as much for as long at a time

42
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:04,500
I starting a company and I think the

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,359
reason why is you know we had to raise

44
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,489
millions of dollars to start bheem and

45
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,229
in order to do that you have to go to

46
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,030
people you trust some people you know

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,920
some people you don't and you have to

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,410
put yourself on the line and say believe

49
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,379
in me and that belief in you is

50
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,209
substantiated by them writing you a huge

51
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,580
check tens of thousands hundreds of

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,069
thousands millions of dollars and the

53
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,390
reason why this fear is just omnipresent

54
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,640
when you're starting a company is to

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,340
fail means having to go back to all

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,290
those people that believed in you the

57
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,230
entire amazing brilliant geniuses that

58
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,629
are the team at being my partner Matt

59
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,459
all of the investors that put their

60
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,069
money on the line all of that in

61
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,859
aggregate just yielded a terror that I

62
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,480
might fail and let down all these people

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,859
that believed in me I'm not bringing

64
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,359
this up to be self congratulatory or

65
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,389
anything like that I just but to omit

66
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,180
that part of this narrative from this

67
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,989
video I think would make this incomplete

68
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,639
the future so if you read any one of

69
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,200
those like hundred articles about what

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,139
we're doing none of them actually say

71
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,030
what it is we're gonna be doing with CNN

72
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,500
are you making an app for them are you

73
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,470
gonna have a TV show I have no idea it's

74
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,739
probably not gonna be I'm Casey dice dad

75
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,829
and this is CNN part of the reason why I

76
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,650
was so excited about working with CNN is

77
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,859
they believed in me they believed in

78
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,780
Matt they believed in our team so much

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,310
that they just wanted this relationship

80
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,620
to happen and then we'd figure out what

81
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,690
it is later so that's what our focus has

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,829
been it's like how do we pull this

83
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,120
together how do we make this happen how

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,859
does this make sense we did all that and

85
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,620
now we're gonna figure out what it

86
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,990
actually is

87
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,280
money everybody loves to talk about

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,930
money I saw a lot of YouTube videos

89
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,970
talking about this CN n partnership the

90
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,860
CNN deal and everyone just wants to talk

91
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,630
about the money there are a lot of huge

92
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,160
numbers being thrown around out there

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,480
and and this is not winning the lottery

94
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,250
there are a lot of people involved in

95
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,070
this this is in no way just this deal is

96
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,459
in no way just me also just as part of

97
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,380
that I don't know why but for whatever

98
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,669
reason making money on YouTube or as a

99
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,790
social media person or in general is

100
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,860
something that people love to all

101
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,330
over on YouTube that's something I will

102
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,580
never understand I think if you watch

103
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,870
this channel you know a little bit of my

104
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,970
background and you know that that when I

105
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,820
started my career at age 17 I was on

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,490
welfare I had nothing everything I have

107
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,160
in my life has been owned and I'm very

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
proud of that and I don't hide from that

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,150
but I'm excited about what this means

110
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,770
I'm excited that this means that I will

111
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,210
be able to continue to provide for my

112
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,120
family but I'm not gonna be buying a

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,490
private jet anytime soon or driving a

114
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,090
Ferrari

115
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:03,540
I don't just thank you for watching

116
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,479
these videos but if I didn't have people

117
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,460
that cared about for whatever reason

118
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,710
about what I share I wouldn't have any

119
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,680
of this and whatever this next journey

120
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,140
brings I hope you're interested enough

121
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,610
and to at least check it out or come

122
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,770
along with me but everything I've ever

123
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,660
done has been because of people like you

124
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,780
who have shared your time in watching

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,520
what it is that I put out there so I

126
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,270
mean it what I say thank you

127
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,680
so that's kind of it I hope that this

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,750
shared I hope that this sheds a little

129
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,630
light on what's going on and look I

130
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,330
really I don't know what's next I don't

131
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,000
know what the future holds for me and my

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
career and YouTube and this new company

133
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,320
and this whole thing I have no idea but

134
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,760
I can tell you when I look back at my

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,800
life there are a lot of times when I've

136
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,120
stood at the bottom of a gigantic

137
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
mountain sometimes figuratively like

138
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,670
when I was 17 and had a baby and

139
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,140
sometimes literally like when I had

140
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,180
actually climbed gigantic mountains this

141
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,640
is me summoning the tallest mountain in

142
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,580
the southern in Western Hemisphere and I

143
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,440
can tell you all those journeys all

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,900
those journeys have taken in life I've

145
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,510
never known how to get to the top of

146
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,790
that mountain I've had no idea what that

147
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,830
would look like or how to do that but I

148
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,760
always knew where to start

149
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,030
because every journey big or small

150
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,740
professional or personal figurative or

151
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,780
literal every journey starts the same

152
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,540
way you take one step forward one step

153
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,120
closer to where you want to be and this

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,820
this whole new company CNN thing this is

155
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,410
the next mountain that I want to climb I

156
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,930
hope you'll come with me and today today

157
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:59,000
is step one
