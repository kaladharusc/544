1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,190
action now in the field

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:21,520
yeah

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,650
right now i'm wearing a backpack

4
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,380
wearing another bag

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,890
while pulling a rolling suitcase while riding a skateboard

6
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,210
I remember why I had to get rid of this old iphone the battery in this thing

7
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,840
dies in like two seconds it's just you fully charged and then

8
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,329
nice car

9
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm 100-percent not by another iphone

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,530
all set taking on my date for theatres in the in the episode where i dropped my

11
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,010
phone

12
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,000
the river a lot of people ask in the comments about phone i use whether it's

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,490
like an iPhone or an Android phone

14
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,810
the truth is I always use both I believe in redundant system so i have android i

15
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,160
have ios and then they're on different networks so it's like I don't get

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,460
service from one over here and make it service from the other over there

17
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,960
usually it works I am pretty big cell phone nerd I've hung on to most of the

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,110
cell phones i didn't lose your drop into rivers or whatever I

19
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,370
yeah

20
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,999
some of my old phones

21
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:58,119
that's why first iphone this thing was awesome

22
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,009
the galaxy s3 with the first android phone that i really like because this

23
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,850
big screen this was like so revolutionary back in the day

24
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,459
then I got this sony phone with my life because it was purple and waterproof but

25
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,810
I cracked it and water got in it and the thing was totally and then I got the HTC

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,540
which I like because of the speakers but I literally drop this into a toilet and

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,930
that stopped working I went in after tho into the toilet

28
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,400
this blackberry was sent to me by blackberries and wanted me to do like a

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,540
video for it

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,200
it sucked so bad i tried to sell it and I couldn't find anybody to buy it

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,760
this was my note 3 i really like this one because it had the pen then I got an

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,459
iphone 6 which these things break

33
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,819
really usually in this one's pretty

34
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,290
they want to the Oscars thing I got this galaxy s7 head

35
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,099
this is my favorite phone I liked it so much that I asked them to send me the

36
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,299
Goldwater and they sent me the gold one but i decided i like the silver one

37
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:04,329
better so I never actually activate this gold one

38
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,739
and then there's also the iphone now so this is the current this is the current

39
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,370
lineup

40
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,370
yeah and that's kind of my current cell phone situation

41
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,400
yeah

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,850
