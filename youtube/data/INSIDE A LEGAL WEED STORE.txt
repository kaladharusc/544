1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
and then oh and did you want to get a did you want to get a little pot before

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,509
I saw that that's really weird

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:34,850
last night we get in at like four in the morning

4
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,260
hoteles de quiet everything shut down we drive our bags and the check-in go up

5
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,280
the hotel room

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,080
wake up this morning and I really just left our car like just left it in front

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,660
of the hotel is either stolen it was towed or maybe the hotel got it and

8
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,050
found my keys that i left somewhere and that's exactly what happened

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,160
I'd like apparently left my keys in the counter where I checked in they found

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,160
the keys are like what's his card

11
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,020
yeah

12
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:24,659
broke one that's belt on the PO keyboard man i'm only a half Power Ball job that

13
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,829
you got it was still sleeping i left the hotel this morning he's got to be up by

14
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:39,659
now i'm going to go back and see if he's this is a weed store

15
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,820
weed is legal in Colorado this is the legal weed store

16
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,689
so the scene cyber week store they're super funny it was really answer

17
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,720
these are definitely weed edibles cookies other cookies gummies

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,810
paraphernalia here these are like candies don't know what these are

19
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,530
cookie dough

20
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,400
we drink of some sort

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:37,030
look how fancy this is the that the marijuana there and this tells you about

22
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,340
it

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,450
this is like the apple store of weed that was cruel like super professional

24
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,209
down their life make a fancy the thing that didn't film was there was like an

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,620
like an apple store but instead of ipads they sold weed I feel like I can't do a

27
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,980
whole segment on a weed store without turning my position on it I think should

28
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,870
be legal and it's stupid that it's not

29
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,430
