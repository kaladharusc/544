1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Francine nice shoes do you like Daddy soon

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:12,030
those are so few actually try to talk well it should be doing that issues

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:32,700
feels good to be back in New York City out running this morning special cast

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
then Brown lets you move

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,710
about seven and a half miles out and had a little bit of a crisis and needed to

6
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,860
use the little boy's room

7
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,310
but you know other than that great run so far

8
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,140
you okay I was like my worst nightmare I was worried about you in there that you

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,700
really going to take you back home

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
it's going ok

11
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,600
yeah

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,690
you think consistency is important

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,390
like schedule life routine like in life do you think that's important

14
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,749
I haven't had any consistency in a really long time

15
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:26,270
last week was big console is gone the entire week and then tomorrow I'm going

16
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,469
on another trip

17
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,920
I don't like I woke up this morning in my own bed and I took friend scene out

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,079
of the crib and I realize how much I cherish just being in one place i am the

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,039
luckiest guy in the world for all these amazing opportunities I have to travel

20
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,719
and meet people and and I wouldn't trade that for anything but i do want to start

21
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,259
working harder to have a little bit more consistency in my life mainly with

22
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:48,950
family

23
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,950
I just want to be around my family more

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,340
I have not given an update on the studio renovations in a while

25
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,530
let me bring you up to speed first I just want to say how hugely embarrassing

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,480
it is this is taken like months and months and months like four years ago I

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,990
built this entire studio from the ground up in like five days

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:25,180
and this is like through many months in and like progress is slow and that's

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,959
just what happens when something is not your number one priority and look I love

30
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,540
this studio but it's just not my number one priority

31
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,220
I got like family and work and videos and family and then I've got to make my

32
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,989
video good life rule is never make excuses because no one gives a shit

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,270
so kind of start to like what is this space for in this space is to be a place

34
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,270
for all of my gear all my quit so it's ready and easily accessible

35
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,069
groans take up a lot of space they've got a lot of parts so we did this whole

36
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,880
area so that would be like a desk where I can assemble drones and put the pieces

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,470
grown bags down here to put the drones in and all that what remains over here

38
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,100
is like a power stations all the drone battery can be charged at all times but

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,060
we don't organize all the blades that goes beyond just a coffee top and again

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,000
I need a drawing i should just come in here grab it

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,310
ready to go camera bodies lenses video camera's batteries all the camera stuff

42
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,810
I have so many I use them all for different purposes so this wall is

43
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,630
supposed to be like where they are easy

44
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,110
ready to grab ready to go and it's getting there it's not right

45
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,739
not perfect it's definitely not done but it's getting there at the point shoot

46
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,819
lenses SLR camera cemetery up here

47
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,540
these are all my old cameras or non-working cameras

48
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,269
these all broke audio setup again this isn't right but it's almost right

49
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,970
I want to know what microphones I have which ones are ready and which ones I

50
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,650
need to grab at any given time

51
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,920
the girl Pro area i really don't like it over here i want to move it over with

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,299
the other cameras but the idea with the GoPro area is that have all my GoPros

53
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,380
out know that they're all charge of all the GoPro accessories ready to go and

54
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,970
just know at a glance where I stand with GoPros so that's where things stand

55
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,989
thank you for bearing with me I can promise you an amazing glorious video of
