00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,100
hey guys great to see you again it's me

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,899
the funniest man on the Internet

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,140
finally back again after only a meager

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,639
294 days since my last video that wasn't

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,620
copyright strike by some random company

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,540
Believe It or Not for the past several

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,250
months I've been doing more than sitting

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,690
on my ass wishing for death

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,369
I just wanted to fill you guys in on the

10
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,750
state of this channel you know where

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,949
it's headed where it's going the

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,550
graveyard getting a job as a janitor

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,949
again at the local high school while I

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,230
was away I made three jontron videos and

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,429
obviously they're not here because I

16
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,710
didn't release them and each time I make

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,880
one I was just kind of like how that's

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,469
not right that's not right and I just

19
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,780
had to kind of stop and ask okay why why

20
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,250
am I feeling that way basically I've

21
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,750
been doing this format for like six or

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,950
seven years now and I know it's not

23
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,950
always consistent but but I think at the

24
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,989
moment for me it's a bit too narrow and

25
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,030
I just want to do more things and

26
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,039
jontron tends to be I know it may not

27
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,539
look like it but it tends to be really

28
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,100
time-consuming it's expensive to make

29
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,129
requires a lot of coordination and it

30
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,690
sort of ends up getting in the way of

31
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,730
other things that I want to do so I'm

32
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,930
not going anywhere but I'm letting you

33
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,579
know I will be breaking away from that

34
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,220
formula a little bit and I'll just be

35
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,479
sort of doing things that I think are

36
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,710
funny and hopefully you'll think they're

37
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,869
funny please please PLEASE ultimately I

38
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,010
just want to keep you guys entertained

39
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,750
because if I don't then it's all

40
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,369
pointless and I figure if I'm having

41
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,990
more fun with everything you guys will

42
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,330
probably enjoy it more - tends to be how

43
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,159
it works so just kind of bear with me

44
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,479
during this transitional period I mean

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,549
what what if I I've only had nearly a

46
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,290
year to sort this out what you looking

47
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:28,740
at me for

48
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,049
but in the meantime I do have way more

49
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,090
jontron video to tide you over with us

50
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,320
you can click this annotation to go

51

53
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,000

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,850
