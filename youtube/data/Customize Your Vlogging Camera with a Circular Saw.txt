1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,740

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,590

4
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:45,620

5
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,640

8
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,160
like I make a video or what I've lost anything i just like to know whatever my

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,880
name is so this morning i get this bonkers email and there's like there's

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:26,340
like a hundred different news outlets have written about my airplane movie i

11
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,990
haven't had a movie go viral like this since probably since the snowboard video

12
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:42,119
bc mr. Bourne movie this is like a nine-minute vlog that's done 10 million

13
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,250
views that's insane okay

14
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,750
in any event why am i bringing this up because there's one article here its

15
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,410
input it's a publication called the gothamist which is like a big New York

16
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:59,040
City blog right here's here's the part that I like it says recently

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,170
professional fun hammer Casey nice tat professional fund our greatest title

18
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,739
ever Casey nice that and then here's the part that makes me look AKA real-life

19
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,850
pucci now look I make a living by sharing my life in the form of videos on

20
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,660
the internet being called names is not something that is new to me but I've

21
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,660
never been called pucci so I look up what Pucci is I think he needs a little

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,530
more

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,140
oh yeah there it is right there i am the real life pucci hold on ready

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,650
somebody I don't always wear a backwards hat i just have really curly hair and if

25
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,090
i take a shower like I do in the airplane and where it hadn't started

26
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:52,330
doing something that's like a little bit stupid and a lot a bit risky it goes it

27
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,080
goes like this

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
ready

29
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,810
take my boosted board and then i take this bike lock wrapped around the pole

30
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,610
and then lock it through my truck just like that so it's locked the trucks

31
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,880
there and then this is locked here

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,060
and then just sort of leaning up against like that

33
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,840
it's risky and stupid because that's really expensive in this isn't super

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,910
safe but for like five minutes you so much easier than carrying a heavy heavy

35
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:29,260
boosted were around a lot to all your videos you do a great job is to take one

36
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,340
I thought I should be about your video you don't breach of you see my wife in

37
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,920
here you see my wife teachers at school said Francine moms playing with water

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,650
but they need more shirts for her

39
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,370
this is where can despise baby shirt just fine

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,340
we have like a photo shoot with the cousins

41
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:04,200
this is all you I don't know any keep up the good work and like watch all your

42
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,550
videos through here

43
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,230
alright I'll see you around look up look it's still there

44
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,690
it held

45
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,370
where the coca-cola dress

46
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:33,500
choose me and then and then I'll go back to the office but you don't like these

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:45,290
faxes don't have the ones that I want my size I like these but they don't they

48
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,550
don't have min 11

49
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:55,070
that's good right Bhayani you enter i try i don't always succeed but I try

50
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,470
like take a half an hour out of every day to spend with a girl like out of the

51
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,250
office doing something try to keep that relationship keep that marriage on the

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,250
level you know

53
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,400
yeah

54
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,130
this is my main camera great camera mmm good camera its weakest link is this

55
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:24,780
right here this mini jack always fries in fact i have to show you i'ma show you

56
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:35,850
what i have i have one two three four and five

57
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,710
oh ok for and all of these have the same issue microphone jack broken i think

58
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,880
there is a very good argument there to say it's completely my fault that the

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,199
microphone jacks broken because I half the time I put the camera down put it

60
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,760
down like this

61
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,300
not cool this little clip here is meant for attaching a camera strap but i think

62
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,560
i think that i can use that to attach a piece of wood and make like a protector

63
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
for this

64
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:29,310
the Japanese pole saws more precise of a tool than this

65
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:39,870
you see the trouble is after navigate around all the precision movement and it

66
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,070
can't get in the way the screens ability to pivot so it's like a very specific

67
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:53,880
size piece of wood here this fit is absolutely magical trying it handled a

68
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:06,270
lot so gonna definitely want soft edges on this no do it we do out there man is

69
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:14,700
that you're vlogging camera wireless well what is that this is a red it's

70
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,700
just like your camera to shoot a little bigger to look at your food

71
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,890
thank you sir i love this building just all people making stuff

72
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,360
alright this is the this is the sketchy part given this a lot of thought and I

73
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,390
really think drilling into this camera would be a bad idea

74
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,600
so I'm going to glue it thermal adhesive hot glue the only one that it's pretty

75
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,860
forgiving one time i use an image similar to this is my thumbnail and

76
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,130
everybody thought I was like smoking crack or something

77
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,500
get in that crack get about four seconds before this fully cure so okay

78
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,290
thus concludes the arts and crafts portion of today's episode

79
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:19,150
it never touches the cable i'm going home we're putting the baby in the

80
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,520
stroller and we're taking her for a walk is tonight as well tonight's special

81
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,290
good job

82
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:35,890
Francine yeah you're the best scooter please job Candice you know the reason

83
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,690
why we had to come out tonight is the last day of summer officially officially

84
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,160
for me you know if you go back 365 episodes that you'll find me saying this

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,460
one year ago today but for me the ear always ends when the summer ends at the

86
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,490
time do you want to get the most bummed out and weird existential your night but

87
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,490
it's also when we get the prettiest sunsets

88
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,270
I get a lot of these requests it's impossible for me to address all of them

89
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,920
because they've got a friend who watches your episodes religiously he's a marine

90
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,030
in the US Marine Corps and was just promoted to Colonel so I just want to

91
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,770
acknowledge and congratulate you

92
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,480
Colonel Dan wisten wisten started on how to pronounce your name from Asheville

93
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,410
North Carolina congratulations on the promotion it's a very big deal and thank

94
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,400
you for your service
