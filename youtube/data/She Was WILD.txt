1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,060
yeah

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,539
is that clear my main focus

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
crispy yeah

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,489
refrigerate upon arrival

5
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,870
I want to say this the camera before I open whatever this package is that this

6
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,960
is filled with cookies or candy

7
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,440
something bad I'm probably just to eat it because i need some sugar

8
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,500
I guess you were big fans you mentioned you want to be serious about eating

9
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,110
healthy so I think we have a perfect organic kale smoothies

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
kale

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,140
spirulina spirulina broccoli parsley cabbage

12
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,140
whoever sent me all these healthy green drinks

13
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,070
thank you very much they look delicious and I'm really glad that this wasn't a

14
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,380
box of I'm really glad it was in a box of candy

15
00:01:52,159 --> 00:02:01,250
no I wish it were candy I wanted it to be candy

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,250
watch this guy load his delivery truck

17
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:25,210
this is incredible this is a shot of the studio from 2007 one litter it blocking

18
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,840
I get a ton of questions about how I catalog all of my footage how to keep

19
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,220
track of everything

20
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,060
and the truth is I'm like meticulous about everything

21
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,290
every shot has ever taken is perfectly catalog some days like today I get stuck

22
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,380
in this like black hole of a vortex digging through my old footage a

23
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,850
beautiful day today

24
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,940
see tonight they are opening up that tiny museum in the back alley and I was

25
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,330
gonna find some archival footage into this whole thing about it

26
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,770
instead I just like I want to show all these old clips to you here is crazy

27
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,550
long hair Casey and outrageous bikini body Candace cold walking together in

28
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,470
2008

29
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,950
this place is exactly like summer camp

30
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,950
fancy

31
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,569
cool there is so much good footage from that trip

32
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,290
unfortunately canvas is like topless in most of it

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,209
I'm not going back to significant

34
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,950
yeah but I think instead of shooting a regular episode today i'm good i'm going

35
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,440
to use all this unused footage from 2007 and tell the story of canvas and Casey

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,989
pre Francine pre-marriage like pre-everything what we broke up after

37
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,989
this was like early in the relationship

38
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,840
yeah

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,200
get a little wet

40
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,390
I'm sorry for the bad image quality but but here is back to the future

41
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,670
blogging from 8-9 years ago

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,430
yeah

43
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,090
the smile

44
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,050
apparently were really late to the air for

45
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:43,199
my vlogging style has not changed in 10 years

46
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,660
head the plane is broken everyone has to get off

47
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,559
the bathroom is the only place on their play where you have privacy about a

48
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,879
laptop with you

49
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,879
it's like your own personal office

50
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,979
I have no idea why she dated me when I had that haircut

51
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,390
yeah

52
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,880
yeah

53
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,320
jumped out the crown of the plant basket on your plate makes you ineligible and

54
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,180
made a bite or something

55
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,130
watching this back I really remember what was going on here so let me share a

56
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,900
little context for you but it is rough seas are rough

57
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,640
we had broken up and gotten back here like a dozen times and maybe like two

58
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,980
months before we went on this trip

59
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,520
we broke up once and frolic we're never getting back together and they're like

60
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,860
we got back together and I thought maybe we both thought that if we went on a

61
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,860
trip together we could fix all of our problems

62
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,590
and I think I can't find the footage of us actually fight it i think we got like

63
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:32,099
this huge like apocalyptic fight somewhere during this trip and while

64
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,039
we're there we disagreed like when we get back to New York City

65
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,030
let's break up and agree never speak to each other games there's no way this

66
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,800
relationship is going to work

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
are you winning

68
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,940
yup that

69
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,940
yeah

70
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,070
you hear that

71
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:33,770
by the way i think i'm going after it

72
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:50,459

77
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,560
you know what I'm realizing as I open this for you

78
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,650
my hand is a little messed up you hold it

79
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,340
I like the strength i don't even pulling that by she is a little while

80
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,729

81
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,470

82
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,599
wow yeah you get you

83
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,680
you can't do it oh god oh god I don't have classes

84
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,360
it doesn't taste like it's been sitting on my shelf for four and a half years

85
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,260
I is mine supposed to sit on shelves for a long time that's true

86
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,950

87
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,950
