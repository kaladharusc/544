Where's the original? I'm try-, cuz he's in a- he's a swimming pool.

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,340

If anyone can please invent a meme currency that puts a new- any meme...

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,180
It's like a stock, right? And you can invest in the meme stock. This, I know this is a billion dollar idea.

47
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,760
Cuz this is a rebound meme. Like this is an older meme coming back.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,200
So let's say you had invested in this meme and then it takes off *?clicks fingers* BAM
