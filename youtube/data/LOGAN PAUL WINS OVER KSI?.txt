1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,300
Logan Paul vs. KSI. When is it going to end???? ( hMMmmM )

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,800
August 25th

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,140
Oh okay. Well then tell them, it is my duty to see this thing through.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,200
I wasn't originally going to make a video on this,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,960
but it seems like new things is just happening every. single. day.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,229
At first we were greeted with these face to face videos and you may think &quot;wow, that might be interesting; finally

7
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:25,700
they talk - face to face.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,560
And we actually get to hear what they say.&quot;

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,800
Host: It's gonna be interesting this one.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,100
No, no, it isn't (aw man). I can summarize it as this: Deji calls Jake Paul a pussy about ten times,

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,040
Deji: Does that ....Isn't she being a pussy really.. JP: Yeah

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,800
Host: what was your-- Okay, what short version is that?

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,420
Deji: he is being a pussy really

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,000
JP: He makes a video calling me a pussy like 50 times

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,560
*Deji laughs for calling JP a pussy 50 times*

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,020
JP: and yeah..

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,289
He-- He's the only one that laughs at his jokes...

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,320
Deji: I remember you said I'm too scared to call you a pussy in your face like to your face. You're a pussy

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm saying it to your face now. You're a pussy

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,060
JP: cool

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,700
Deji: yeah. I remember you said you gonna do something

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,650
I'll call you a pussy. I'm calling you a pussy now

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,289
Yeah, yeah, honestly, I just can't wait. you're a pussy I'm saying it to your face.

24
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,420
???'?? ? ?????

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,260
*poods snicker time*

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,860
Or in case you're wondering when the fight is, that it was also talked about just a couple of times

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,860
deji: August 25th you and meh

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,520
JP: *Can't think of anything to say so he just looked in his arms maybe there's one in there.*

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
Deji: August twenty-fifth

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,560
*JP is speechless*

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,160
August 25th

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,100
?????? 25?? ( for God sake )

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,960
AUGUST TWENTY FIFTH this is gonna be the best

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,020
*laughs like there is no tomorrow*

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,980
*JP is like 'u what' *

36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,420
Deji: das about it really

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,040
*JP peace sign for peace fight , no calling him pussy, no august 25, no violence nor profanity*

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,460
august twenty-fif- (YES WE GET IT)

39
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,800
and then Logan Paul versus KSI

40
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,500
face-to-face appeared and it was

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,200
Equally uninteresting. Basically a drinking water competition.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
K: I'm in your head

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,080
LP: I think we have a problem.

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,200
K: don't worry bro

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
LP: put that hand B A C K

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Host: What are you doing? Are you mad ?

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,480
K: hmm?

48
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,100
*metal gear solid music in the background*

49
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,580
(this is so lame)

50
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,640
At least they're hydrated. ??

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,720
That's always a good thing to know.

52
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
K: that's a better outfit

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,340
LP: What?

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
K: Better outfit than last time?

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,420
LP: You think so ?

56
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,220
K: yeah

57
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,580
LP: i'll see you two

58
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,970
Alexa this is so nice. Two people that hate each other can come together while wearing their favorite Walmart

59
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,330
Finally they get along this really warms my heart (now play despacito)

60
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,660
KSI talked about how he

61
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,960
destroyed Weller

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
K:: I destroyed Weller. Host: What do you think of that?

63
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,700
Let's just hope this fight is a bit more interesting than the

64
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,840
KSI versus Joe Weller fight

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,580
referee: right hook by JJ another trap by JJ told not answering so hasn't thrown a punch yet

66
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,700
Joe needs to start throwing Joe needs to throw

67
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Joe needs to throw a punch

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:47,540
*epic fighting scene*

69
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,860
(Some bull shit in the back )

70
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,540
In the final press conference

71
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,680
Logan took a big out he basically cried on stage

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,300
â„Œ???? ????????, ?? ??? ??????...

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,720
You

74
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,950
So Logan decided

75
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,020
Mm-hmm. No, no

76
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:08,690
He's gonna make a response video to explain why he left the press conference called dear KSI

77
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,390
Here's why I walked OFF stage

78
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,410
LP: Goddamn, if you thought the last press conference was a disaster

79
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,060
This one was a major disaster

80
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,120
if you're wondering why his voice is so high right now

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,960
Well, there's a simple reason for that

82
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,240
Well, you know because 'I'm vegan now&quot;.

83
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,900
In this video Logan explains the madness that went on behind the scenes, people were crazy

84
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,800
His dad even got punched

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,720
LP: When we tried to get out

86
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,340
they were kicking our cars the gold rolls and the gold Bentley kids were like climbing on top of buildings, and shit

87
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,380
Punched in the back of the head my dad. Did he deserve it? Maybe

88
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,500
this video is very

89
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,600
Well-crafted and I'm gonna go through widest piece by piece and it starts now

90
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,760
He's calling out the madness of this event and he's shifting the blame of that and the reason his dad got punched

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,340
To Deji

92
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,460
LP: and then I remembered (his voice sounds like a kid lol)

93
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
Deji told them to beat

94
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,540
&quot;You can go out and find em' in London, if you do, do what you want, I don't care&quot;

95
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,400
They're in our country ! They're in our territory ! You don't know how it is in England. You guys think you're safe.

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,160
&quot;We'll shank you twist the knife and leave it, that's what we do&quot;

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,320
Deji is clearly joking. This is a clever way for Logan to get the moral high ground

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,350
Oh, it was so bad how everything was out of control. It would have gotten out of control regardless of Deji's comment

99
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,710
You know that that's a fact so that's the first thing he does and that's the thing a lot of people

100
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:38,630
As soon as they saw this Logan Paul video, they were like, oh I'm on. I'm on board with Logan Paul train now, really?

101
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,330
Really? He then for some reason calls out KSI for just recycling jokes

102
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,500
That's all he did during the press conference

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,060
LP: I thought that joke was used in the last press conference. But apparently we're recycling content. Okay?

104
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,140
'Still not end up in the final movie.'

105
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,000
Pretty good joke, I'm not gonna lie. He got me good there. But again, I saw you tweeted about this already like multiple times

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,780
I guess I just was confused. I didn't know we're still recycling content. But okay. &quot; Your sick delusional dad

107
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,180
It's so crazy cuz I just thinking back. I feel like he said the same thing in the first press conference

108
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,440
&quot;85 % of your testicle&quot; brother. Are we still recycling content Wow, these brothers sure are creative.  (he's rly acting like a kid now lol)

109
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,720
Wow these brothers sure are creative(pewds does it better)

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,420
WAAALLLLMAAARTTT

111
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,060
At least I didn't recycle my favorite

112
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,449
punch line

113
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,550
Walmart, at least I have enough integrity not to do that Logan

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,520
The only thing you said in the entire press conference then one thing you said was a recycled joke

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,580
You can't call out ksi for recycling jokes. It doesn't work.

116
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,109
LP: Funny to hear you. Talk about your baby carrot á´…Éªá´„á´‹. Keep going

117
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:52,400
I enjoy it &quot;grew a little thick today, but it's a little one&quot; (and he's a vegan lol)

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,810
LP: Yo and I'm vegan and I'm vegan so I recognized a baby carrot when I see one

119
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:07,000
Ha ha ha ha ha baby carrot small penis. You have small penis. Well you dress bad. Well, you're a pussy

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,280
??the insults

121
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,040
I really appreciate then he goes on and bring in the reason why, the reason why he walked out of the press

122
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,520
Conference the reason why he didn't say anything, you know why it was it wasn't because he was scared

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,280
It wasn't because he looked like it was about to cry it was because of the moderator. That's right everybody

124
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,100
Deji: ??*? Jake Paul, ??*? Jake paul, KSI: ??*? the ?????? (hyper to the max)

125
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,160
LP: But whatever man so I'm thinking why it is just so one-sided

126
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,650
Why did the moderator let JJ talk for 5 minutes and 20 seconds straight? Yes

127
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,360
I timed it and why are we not talking about the fight and then I remembered holy asshat

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,760
This dude ?**????(family friendly Logan) hates me.

129
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,800
MOD: bullying pauls. This kids are big in YouTube at America

130
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,220
Just a douche bag joke while he's not hurting anyone, you know, he's a fucking idiot. But who cares?

131
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,960
He's not here any where.

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,420
that is the nicest thing I have ever heard. Anyone explain Logan Paul

133
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:08,780
He's an idiot, but he's not hurting anyone. You should be thanking him. That's like a compliment for your stand-in Logan

134
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,860
So the moderator made a response to this

135
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,380
mod: True Geordie  here a response to logan paul, or as he likes to call me the moderator

136
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,560
Pewdiepie called me the ref. Should i-- Do you know can we just get this straight? True Geordie

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,700
true Geordie the true Geordie. I'm sorry

138
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm sorry, please don't hurt me. OK true Geordie got it.

139
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,360
(His name is True Geordie everyone. True Geordie. If you won't believe check out True Geordie. Get it straight, T r u e  G e o r d i e)

140
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,660
LP: And why are we not talking about the fight.

141
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,680
True geordie: maybe because you didn't say a f@cking word mate

142
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,960
I love that response. Why did he just speak for five minutes? I don't understand maybe because you didn't say anything

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,520
He then calls out True Geordie for not being neutral

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,090
for being on the side of ksi

145
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:54,580
LP: I just don't think the moderator(TRUE GEORDIE) of the press conference the person who should be neutral, the person who should be the one driving

146
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,900
the conversation

147
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,120
Should be a Logan and Jake Paul hater (then some bullshit amaturity as expected)

148
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,860
He literally said

149
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,490
He's an idiot, but he's not hurting anyone. Wow, what a hater and if it's a problem that he isn't neutral

150
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,760
this argument is so ridiculous because

151
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,300
Literally the Tech N9ne looking guy. I'm sorry. I don't know your name, please. Don't hurt me either, please

152
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,479
They're clearly friends too, even in the press conference. He was standing on the side of the pauls (man i'm tired, the editor before me wrote polls every where!)

153
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:27,599
I remember this look at he's right there next to É¢Ê€á´‡É¢ á´˜á´€á´œÊŸ's á´…á´€á´…(lol what pewds!!! you need a break). What is he doing there?

154
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,900
I thought he was supposed to be neutral. Apparently, that's a big issue

155
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,889
So Logan Paul went out of his way to make sure that true

156
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:40,479
T R U E Geordie wasn't going to commentate over this fight because he commented on the original fight with ksi

157
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,130
So he doesn't want him to commentate because he's not neutral apparently when in reality

158
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,180
I think he did a really good job considering all the circumstances

159
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,220
Apparently they settle it in on a phone call or something like that and he is actually going to comment on the fight

160
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,050
Most likely not because Logan Paul is a nice person

161
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,639
But because people were outraged and pissed off that he was and go I'm going to be allowed to do it

162
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,089
LP: But so there's a reason I walked out. There's a reason I keep saying I'm done with the talk

163
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,500
that's the reason why everybody that's the reason why I walked out not because I had nothing to say and I was

164
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Literally on the verge of tears

165
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,520
* farts n tears *

166
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,740
Think about how much money you're gonna make out of this event that it shouldn't be that hard to go through all this so

167
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,600
so shifting blame

168
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,190
Taking the moral high ground

169
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,340
But now is when the video really takes

170
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,380
that it's deepest turn

171
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,420
LP: the exact person that I am working hard not to become

172
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,389
I made an

173
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,870
Unforgivable mistake back in January and no one is ever gonna forget that, that is a part of my life now

174
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,750
I am the one who at the end of every single day

175
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,060
have to look in the mirror and ask myself what the

176
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,080
f*** wrong in my life where I thought that was a good idea.

177
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,640
Logan Paul plays the moral high ground and

178
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:03,480
I guess against KSI that's not really hard to do but for Logan Paul to do this it

179
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,690
it's ah interesting

180
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,870
it's very interesting and a lot of people bought it and he does it really well because he has a strong argument

181
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,399
LP: For example KSI, I did not want to take the low blows. I did not want to get personal

182
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,300
But you bringing up my girlfriend Chloe Bennet

183
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
What's up, babes?

184
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,940
audience: SHE'S A  H O E. SHE'S A  H O E. ( i guess )

185
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,439
*logan in sorrow*

186
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:31,440
Now KSI

187
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,389
Now Ksi

188
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,980
He is a scumbag

189
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,790
You're both scumbags KSI has made same comments about my FUturE wife Marzia

190
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,399
It's it and I never respond to it because it's just cringy

191
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,089
So if anything

192
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,420
I understand why Logan didn't respond here cuz it's like, it's- it's such a low

193
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,670
Comment that is literally only going to respond to the 12 year olds in an audience like this

194
00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:00,259
But anyone else will see it and be like, yeah, that's really dumb. Like that's really pathetic. That's a stupid ass comment

195
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,809
So Logan really has to offer our hand here to play the moral high ground and be like and all this just so bad

196
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:10,499
I can't believe you treat my girlfriend like an object and he does it very well

197
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,108
LP: After you said this about Chloe in your last video

198
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,379
KSI: how's he gonna go down on you a busted lip

199
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,559
*ultimate laugh*

200
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:23,149
I'm sorry, Chloe, but after the 25th of August Logan's gonna have to fuck you like a prostitute if you know what I mean

201
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,029
*maniacal laughter*

202
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:31,640
And then he shows all clips of KSI when he went to conventions and making sexist comments to the show booth girls

203
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,600
KSI: Massive tits where have your tits gone?

204
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,260
Random girl:  Where've they gone?

205
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,900
KSI: Yeah

206
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,220
Random girl: What'd you mean?

207
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,229
Because I can't see them.

208
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,680
Because I can't see them and also the comments he made about his friends little sister cause I'm gonna explore her p***y

209
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,760
And also the comments he made about his friends, little sister

210
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,920
&quot;I'm gonna explore her p****sy&quot;

211
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,809
Her sister: I think, that us girls, need to kinda standup for ourselves.

212
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:51,820
So he brings up the past behaviour of KSI and he associates it with the current behavior of KSI

213
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,872
So he brings up the past behavior ksi associated with the current behavior case. I'm very clever very smart

214
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:59,200
very clever very smart
So he brings up the past behavior ksi associated with the current behavior case. I'm very clever very smart

215
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,640
He's got him now, but he doesn't just stop there. He goes after his brand

216
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,300
LP: six years, you still doin the same sh*t

217
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,129
Even when I warned you off-camera when I tried to make it clear that this was going somewhere

218
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,329
I did not want it to go

219
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,520
How do people not know about how do you have a brand deal with EA or any big brands for that matter
Logan must be

220
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,428
Logan must be

221
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,509
Logan must be really pissed for going after

222
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,499
Brand deals that KSI's got working. Like that's a really low blow as well

223
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:29,239
i-if not equally vicious because he was essentially going after KSI's livelihood

224
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:34,800
But then he does even better is that he protects himself from the same criticism

225
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,020
Logan is not innocent of doing this exact same thing KSI did

226
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,480
LP: typically with my music video &quot;No Handlebars&quot;

227
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,280
*shows shite music*

228
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,380
Where he made this song about handlebars and he can ride girls were there or whatever

229
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,460
LP: It's got 42 million views this type of content. No longer accurately represents my brand and the person that I am becoming *lmao really?*

230
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,970
Okay, so this is no handlebars. I'm going over and I am deleting it from YouTube

231
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,960
A N D

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,670
So he protects himself from the same criticism even though he's literally just being a hypocrite. What's even better by this

233
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,090
Is that this song had a lot of drama related to it? Because it's blatant plagiarism

234
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,550
Anyone that's heard the original song that this is based on know that that's a fact, even the creators of the song

235
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,610
Went out and said this is so dumb. I can ride my bike with no handlebars. No handlebars

236
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,260
No handlebars

237
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,040
And I can own it. It's the same song

238
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,690
You just made it the same song except it's sexist Logan Paul edition, but you deleted it

239
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,810
So, you know KSI is really the bad one here

240
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,620
he's really the problem and then he goes even further to paint KSI a

241
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,250
Villain by I can't believe I'm defending KSI

242
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,330
Here. It's so stupid

243
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:56,660
but he goes on and-- and  making him seem like he has a giant ego by calling himself a God and

244
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,460
Doing his face to face things.

245
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,580
LP: but this kid literally looked me in the eye and told me he was God

246
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,720
G O D , GOD. That's where his head is at right now.

247
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,440
LP: I wouldn't get in a room with me. KSI: I would, I'm crazy LP: I'm an animal. I'm a dog bro. If there were two of me KSI: Then I'm a God

248
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,900
*face to face conversation* I'm an animal. I'm a dog bro.There were two of me -- Ksi: I'm the god.

249
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
LP: You're you're a god

250
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Ksi: Yea yea. You're an animal, I'm the god ( oh rly )

251
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,940
LP: This is what God looks like ? Jesus Christ. We got some work to do.  Ksi: Why you talking about my son

252
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,410
(hilarious)

253
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:28,710
It's funny. It's a joke. It's obviously a joke. Just like you're calling yourself an animal

254
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,960
You don't think you're an animal

255
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,960
You don't think you're a dog so KSI made a response to this. You should check it out. He basically

256
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,500
Disputed all these claims saying that the clip of him saying that Chloe was a prostitute

257
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,040
it wasn't implying that she was a

258
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,910
prostitute just like-- Logan will have such a broken lips that she's not gonna want to kiss him like you don't want to kiss

259
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,430
a prostitute. The Caspar Lee clip was basically

260
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,020
Unrelated to his event anyway, so you're just lying there as well

261
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:04,050
so this video, you know, I'll give it props for being-- for being well put together and clever but it just shows how

262
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,090
Logan will take any

263
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,600
Step, even if it's lying. Cuz I don't think it was wrong for being pissed off about the girlfriend comment

264
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,260
I get that but the way he goes about it attacking his brands and all these things

265
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,710
He just doesn't care. You have other girls who used to know ksi saying that if Logan Paul ever makes a comment about respecting women

266
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,820
He is full of Sh, there's so many other videos where Logan is equally bad as ksi in my opinion

267
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Ksi: ... So probably delete this video as well

268
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:41,840
*some full of dirt vid*

269
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,280
And this video

270
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,420
*another full of dirt vid*

271
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,620
There's a lotta hot females here. I have this idea where I would ride them

272
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,600
*dafuq is that mustache*

273
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,460
But like-- but like a bicycle not in the sexual way. So we're gonna make this thing as formation out of people

274
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,000
It's called the human bike we're gonna put the girls and me on this platform and then roll down

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,050
the street

276
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,050
Issue is, it looks kind of ridiculous like this

277
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,800
So yeah, except it's gonna be four girls and me

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,680
on top of them (not a nice guy like pewsiepei)

279
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,480
The issue is that we haven't told them we're doing this yet. So that should be fun and this video

280
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,520
Ksi: and this video

281
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,640
(another full of dirt vid everybody)

282
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,390
shifting blames, taking the moral high ground

283
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,790
Making all kinds of lives and claims

284
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,950
The thing is... I had been with both ksi and Logan, but the thing is

285
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,310
These guys are just purely driven by money

286
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,770
this whole event is going to make them a lot of money if

287
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,370
Logan thinks he's going to make more money by being a nice guy

288
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,010
He's going to pretend to be a nice guy

289
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,340
Logan is the kind of person that will be whatever it takes for him to get what he wants

290
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,760
LP: I'm gonna be the guy they think I am and

291
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,840
I essentially

292
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,470
Became the architect of my own destruction because I wanted to be who they thought-- I thought I might as well adopt this

293
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,300
adopt this, screw it and

294
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,810
Casey: It wasn't that a direct contradiction to everything

295
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,430
You just put out about how you're changing and how you're a different person

296
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:09,380
I do want to give people a second chance. I think they deserve it. But when people blatantly lie, and other people are

297
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,680
Buying into it. I saw a lot of people saw this video and be like, whoa. I'm on board with Logan Paul now

298
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,440
I feel like it's I have to call it out. That being said this video has been extremely long and I hope I don't

299
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,430
have to make another video because I honestly I don't care. Between ksi and

300
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,310
Logan who do I think should win?

301
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,770
The thing is Logan can't lose. If he loses

302
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,710
I think people will sympathize with him and if he wins he wins. If ksi loses

303
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,660
He's just gonna look like an idiot because KSI says he wants to do professional boxing now

304
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,400
Which if you lose against a youtuber--  that career is over before it's begun

305
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,440
I think KSI will win and I don't think it really matters. What happens to Logan if anything

306
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,520
He's in a really good position right now. He-- all he has to do is stop lying. That's all you got to do

307
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,980
Stop lying. Great. This is this video, leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed watching it
