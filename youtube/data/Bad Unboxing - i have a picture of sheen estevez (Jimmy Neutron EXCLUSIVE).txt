00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,010
I spent a long time on this episode's

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,800
wall gag probably far too much time

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,030
because I don't think it's gonna work

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,070
but let me run it through you I

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,490
basically I contacted Dumbledore I told

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,619

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,779

anyway I'm opening a portal behind me

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,650
and the way you open the portal is by

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,710
hitting this button now if all goes to

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,290
plan it should look really epic does it

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,579
kind of seem like there's a portal

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,180

65
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,040

want to take away the bee and that's

76
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,060
taking away the beer and that's arguably

77
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,639
the most important thing to be honest

78
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,980
