1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,470
the oldest stories ever told are written

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,960
in the stars regulation the Titans were

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,209
powerful but their reign was ended by

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,630
their own sons King Gramps in one yard

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,330
short in current water it was used who

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,660
created man and man's prayers fed the

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,740
gods immortality

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,570
what kind of King system is this so

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,220
where the gods not already a mortal to

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,800
Zeus invent immortality hey I know

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,660
I'll make men but let's make something

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,190
up that they can do to feed our

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,880
immortality

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,430
I know prayers those are fun into this

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,950
world a child was born but don't let the

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,000
Jesus imagery smack you in the face

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,070
during this 3d presentation

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,660
Perseus that's one way to do character

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,640
introduction I'm your father Perseus

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,860
whoa wait a minute how did Spiros know

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,780
to name his son Perseus I guess you're

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,100
going to tell me that he had heard it in

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,079
a wind or something 2010 the Year

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,820
Studios thought Sam Worthington would

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,890
become the next Brad Pitt in 2018 more

26
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,420
people know who Kevin Sorbo is but hey

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,310
at least we got Man on a Ledge out of

28
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,909
him nothing I mean you can't expect to

29
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,380
find a dead woman and a newborn baby

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,220
every day

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,619
oh you meant fish one day somebody's

32
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,330
gonna have to make a stand one day

33
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,610
somebody's gonna have to say enough this

34
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,020
is the part of Greek mythology that is

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,580
always confused and excited me there

36
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,290
were actually people who just one day

37
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,869
said we're gonna fight some goddamn gods

38
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,990
and they did it and they be won and most

39
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,830
of us are stuck with the boring

40
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,299
Christian God and the water divine

41
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,130
miracles and the people getting the fish

42
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,470
how would it be Greek just like the day

43
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,330
you came to me the storm brought me

44
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,799
right to you but on the day you found

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,509
him there was no storm in sight and I

46
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,689
have questions son I wish I had answers

47
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,640
I do know who Keyser sÃ¶ze is if you ever

48
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,259
need that info for some reason the

49
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,100
Statue of Zeus

50
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,540
magnificent awesome we're just in time

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,400
to watch soldiers cut it down and watch

52
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,720
it crash into the water right next to us

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,520
we're such a cinematically convenient

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,080
fishing boat Argo yourself bad wolf boss

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,060
I realize the gods are all-knowing but

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,800
geez that was a quick reaction do they

57
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,810
just have fallback setup at all possible

58
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,240
to find God's locations also Hades shows

59
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,460
up as multiple winged creatures from the

60
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,110
fucking ocean there seems to be two

61
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,980
things wrong with that

62
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,840
the ocean is Poseidon's own and wings

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,640
and water don't mix I learned that when

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,230
I apprentice with Satan this movie also

65
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,020
decided to say beside and lilybeth Percy

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Jackson ah

67
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,850
wait a minute so hades knew which men to

68
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,260
kill after the statue got knocked into

69
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,270
the water but decided yeah why not the

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,470
innocent people on this fishing boat to

71
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,750
be the only instance of he survives this

72
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,550
curry in this film so let's just go

73
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,200
ahead and tack on 20 cents here for all

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,390
of them even if he is a demigod io tells

75
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,580
us later that he's still mortal so gosh

76
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,040
I created them Liam Neeson isn't killing

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,590
anyone in the seat how long must be by

78
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,690
Mike out 17 years always knew very

79
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,520
Fiennes and Liam Neeson would reunite

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,050
after Schindler's List I just thought it

81
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,280
would be something more dignified than

82
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
this like a fast and furious movie

83
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,400
there's some delightful British rom-com

84
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,320
or a guy who owns a shop selling hats

85
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,820
hates the guy across the street who

86
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,680
sells ties but they're both in love with

87
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,239
the same woman who makes themselves the

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,830
best toad-in-the-hole this side of stuff

89
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,930
fell upon me lon father we need the

90
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,959
mortals know Apollo Hades is right the

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,340
way the scene is set up I'm surprised

92
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,140
none of these gods have name tags just

93
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,640
about every bit of dialogue contains a

94
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,530
character name in it oh sweet looks like

95
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,090
they're taking him to that huge painting

96
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,220
on the mountain awesome we lost many men

97
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,740
majesty

98
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,390
but we have victory you're only supposed

99
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,190
to cut down a statue of zeus right so

100
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,960
really losing any men seems like non

101
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,960
victory the gods need us they need our

102
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,810
wash what do we need of them good

103
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,350
question

104
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,520
there isn't one second of this movie

105
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,570
devoted to what the gods actually

106
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,280
provide when humans bread and there was

107
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,600
it one second of this movie devoted to

108
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,950
what the gods were doing when humans

109
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,700
stopped praying

110
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,470
it took knocking down a zoo statue for

111
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,910
anything to happen coming this fall to

112
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,480
sci-fi refines is thornado

113
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,550
okay so we're mixing Greek and Norse

114
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,050
gods and he's not playing anything like

115
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,570
Thor but Hades nado just didn't have the

116
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,130
same rate you know well how do the

117
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,570
mortals even stand a chance against

118
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,790
Hades he can open his cloak and I mean

119
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,250
yes the power to he makes a bunch of fly

120
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,780
at you in ten days when the Sun all this

121
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,880
is happening within ten days of a solar

122
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,530
eclipse I didn't know what timeline

123
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,270
could be both arbitrary and convenient

124
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,110
but here we are

125
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,130
choose your penance Argos destruction or

126
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,890
sacrifice or they could just move have I

127
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,870
heard his prayers I don't know but I'd

128
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,640
love to see how that process works is

129
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,920
impossible if it's true you are the son

130
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,410
of Zeus you can save us this crowd jumps

131
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,880
to some serious conclusions

132
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,650
Hades looking at Perseus when he made

133
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,060
the will of your father comment when it

134
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,320
clearly sounded like he was just making

135
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,180
a general statement is literally all

136
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,680
they have to base their assumptions on

137
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,660
he's right no one should have to die for

138
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,430
me except maybe your mother because

139
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,960
she's the one who spouted off all the

140
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,880
because this all happened that guy did

141
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,590
util family maybe this is argumentative

142
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,960
but how did she guide him to his family

143
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,550
did she have power over the so called

144
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,260
storm that led Spiros to the place where

145
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,940
he found him or was she the one who

146
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,560
turned the coffin into a buoy he

147
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,610
wouldn't emerge from the bottom of the

148
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,290
sea and when Spiros found the baby you

149
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,480
said this pass yes if you were the

150
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,920
person orchestrating all this why would

151
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,560
you say pass us like this wouldn't you

152
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,270
be like awesome my magic worked rather

153
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,670
than saying paisius like a person who

154
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,350
finally found the baby as opposed to

155
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,090
guiding his journey the whole time I was

156
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,340
cast with agelessness so much to focus

157
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,430
Perseus would be amazing at cinemasins

158
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,680
yes decreased think he could take out a

159
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,270
God with a sword don't they have the

160
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,069
equivalent of a Merlin or at least a cue

161
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,360
that could invent some kind of God

162
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,159
killing weapon better than a pink sword

163
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,279
he ordered the execution of his wife and

164
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,520
Zeus his newborn son so we did they kill

165
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,590
the mother and put a living child with

166
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,509
her in the coffin or did they even try

167
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,129
to kill the kid first and did they

168
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,419
seriously wait nine months for her to

169
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,889
give birth before executing her I've

170
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,080
watched over you ever since waiting for

171
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,060
the day when you will help bring an end

172
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,499
to the tyranny of the gods

173
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:53,789
it's been a while since I Greek

174
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,469
mythology but if I remember correctly

175
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,750
there are many demigods so what exactly

176
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,009
is so special about Perseus you're

177
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,389
telling me that Zeus hasn't pulled the

178
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:02,039
Revenge of the Nerds sex trick a few

179
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,509
other times makes you think the witches

180
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,099
would tell us anything or they'll tell

181
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,990
us I'll kill them too

182
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,789
okay homeboy here has been a fisherman

183
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:10,529
his entire life he just got word that

184
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:11,849
he's a demigod I don't think he's ever

185
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:12,870
been trained as a fighter but

186
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,550
immediately after he hears IOT's story

187
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,379
he's absolutely sure he's an immortal

188
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,319
badass what is this just leave it

189
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,180
Ruby turns its nose up to the 1981

190
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,099
original with a discarded boo boo

191
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,629
appearance but then doesn't actually

192
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,789
prove itself to be any better also how

193
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,050
is this movie not better than the

194
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,849
original sure that movies entertaining

195
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,159
with fun Ray Harryhausen stop-motion

196
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,839
effects but it's not a huge obstacle to

197
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,400
overcome I mean you're going up against

198
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,050
a movie that has Harry fucking Hamlin in

199
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,029
the lead role and you still leave as the

200
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,189
worst version well at least until the

201
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:42,899
wrath of the Titans my brother and I we

202
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,550
know how to kill a be terrible comic

203
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,810
relief in a movie that doesn't need any

204
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,560
we have an enemy in common Zeus wouldn't

205
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,149
be able to hear him say this Hades was

206
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,680
able to hear the crack about Andromeda

207
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,599
being hotter than Aphrodite until I

208
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,199
possess my full power you will be my

209
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,479
weapon so is this just the Freddy vs.

210
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,279
Jason plotline hey if we're gonna steal

211
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,979
steal from something so why does Calibos

212
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,289
/at greasiest look like this is this the

213
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,029
underworld is he dead and even if he is

214
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,409
what exactly killed him that made him

215
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,759
look like this well this movie explain

216
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,500
any of this nonsense I believe I have an

217
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,870
answer to that last question you fucking

218
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,250
what I guess this is some sort of

219
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,050
demigod killing magic did he have to

220
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,919
transfer that orally I'm not judging

221
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,599
for me about destroy Zeus who you Clash

222
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,310
of the Titans movie turns in to throw

223
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,590
Zeus from the Train also I love fine but

224
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,789
they really should have cast someone

225
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,409
else in this role he is not far enough

226
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,909
removed from Harry Potter and this is

227
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,139
ripping off Harry Potter all over the

228
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,590
place emotions should be fluid the both

229
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,419
training in this movie one little scene

230
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,370
when someone gives total nonsense advice

231
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,930
somehow it works and we're supposed to

232
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,550
buy it just because he's Demi Moore I

233
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:58,009
mean a demigod is Russia's also I'm

234
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,150
assuming the production meeting went

235
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,409
something like this we can't have a

236
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,330
mechanical owl in this movie but we can

237
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,729
have a Pegasus right yeah a Pegasus

238
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:07,879
prints money the Pegasus no man has ever

239
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,710
written all i have to do is connect your

240
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,090
hair braid thing in him and you'll be

241
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,680
flying around with zoe saldana in no

242
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,069
time

243
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,840
it's a message hell watching us

244
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,330
apparently helping Perseus but why Zeus

245
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,949
gave Hades free rein to deal with the

246
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,839
humans and from what we can tell Zeus

247
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,430
knows nothing of Hades deception these

248
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,529
gifts make no sense I know this dude has

249
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,240
got some of Hades powers now but why

250
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,740
didn't he just wait until everybody was

251
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,069
asleep

252
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,960
Kali loss grabs Perseus by the head and

253
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,699
he sits there doing nothing for a full 6

254
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,199
seconds until Mann's can save the day

255
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,969
why the is he running away he just

256
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,039
literally tore a dude in half I don't

257
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,510
even understand what he needs a sword

258
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,610
for so Kali Mawson blood turns into

259
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,519
scorpions which is rip also try figuring

260
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,690
out how many scorpions are in this

261
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,550
battle since the heroes split up and

262
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,140
that scorpion blood is everywhere it

263
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,790
could be anywhere from 5 to 10 but

264
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,980
you'll never know just one long shot of

265
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,779
the area the number of scorpions and

266
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,149
where everybody is would do waters also

267
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,949
also why are they even sticking around

268
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:02,720
to fight the giant scorpions run away

269
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,459
and if they follow you then fight why

270
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,019
risk losing your army over something

271
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,610
that is posing a threat to no-one at the

272
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,949
moment also times 3 how is this not

273
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,250
exciting because it's not like at all a

274
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,050
bunch of warriors of fighting giant ask

275
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,279
scorpions and it might as well be a

276
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,990
scene of people shopping for groceries

277
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,630
oh yeah ex machina so guys I'm gonna

278
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,769
pick this moment to go get some popcorn

279
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,750
and candy maybe even a slushy someone

280
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,190
catches the spear and uses it in the

281
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,460
next hour let me know

282
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,990
this is their desert it's not so

283
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,399
convenient that they came to save the

284
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:31,640
day

285
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,130
although yeah kind of is but it's more

286
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,020
convenient that they came just after the

287
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,790
movie put in a big scorpion battle scene

288
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,320
so it could pretend to entertain you for

289
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,980
five minutes

290
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,810
funny this is exactly how I look when

291
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm trying to resist the urge to

292
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,120
masturbate what is it oh it wasn't that

293
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,630
bad

294
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,070
Tom Hardy was kind of fun and it was

295
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,020
super ridiculous but in the end we must

296
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,110
pray to the one who showed us our sin

297
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm definitely not helping right for the

298
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,649
famous seriously

299
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,480
why does a ferryman need quarters is he

300
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,310
saving up to buy a yacht the gin doesn't

301
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,630
try to communicate to anyone before

302
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,310
attempting the blue fire arm healing

303
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,779
method leading to yet another action

304
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,430
scene that I want to jettison into the

305
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,120
Sun did you never waited many years for

306
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,470
the one who will free them from the gods

307
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,839
good King God why didn't the Djinn try

308
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,550
to communicate this earlier to everyone

309
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,750
he could've at least tried to draw

310
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,250
pictures in the sand before this turned

311
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,290
into a misunderstanding also good thing

312
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,089
a person who spoke Jim showed up

313
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,649
randomly or they would all be dead Chaka

314
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,459
bolo Malfoy well we need to make up for

315
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,990
lost time but the scorpions aren't

316
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,310
moving any faster than anyone in this

317
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,870
crew so that's a waste of scorpions

318
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,670
right there when I spit in the eyes of

319
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,130
the gods they not smile so Draco's plan

320
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,820
is to give the gods hepatitis C Sabrina

321
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:48,020
the elderly testicle face which is any

322
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,459
excuse for this movie to go into a hyper

323
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,000
edit an action scene will suffice

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
so the plan is to find Medusa cut off

325
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,450
her head and use it against the Kraken

326
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,770
but how long is this whole journey

327
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,270
taking they only have 10 days and

328
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,440
earlier when they were in the forest

329
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,180
they said it would take four days to get

330
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,680
to the witches so now they need to find

331
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
Medusa cut off her head and get back to

332
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,709
fight the Kraken in another four days

333
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,760
which I'm gonna go ahead and declare

334
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,410
impossible it's almost like they know

335
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,850
the Pegasus is coming she's no use

336
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,980
against the croc we can't control them

337
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,690
and we take the head how do you know her

338
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,040
head will still turn people into stone

339
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,839
once it's cut off why are the chin

340
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
leaving us they believe we will all die

341
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,520
it's the prophecy and their dicks also

342
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,810
one of brothers doesn't want to pay for

343
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,040
any more of the special effects budget

344
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,490
to keep them or the scorpions around you

345
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,620
does mine perseus and that makes you a

346
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,570
god it's time you came to Olympus I

347
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,010
started living like one with the man

348
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,930
that raped his mother sounds enticing

349
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,220
tell me more

350
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,020
cuz successions this shit from the

351
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,500
scorpio scorpianas has got to be the

352
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,120
laziest way to rename something that was

353
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,649
obviously a scorpion next thing you know

354
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,240
they'll be fighting shark ETA's and

355
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,029
Geronimo's i know the way of course you

356
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,130
do why does no one question io just

357
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,080
showing up translating jin and knowing

358
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,610
the answer to everything when they don't

359
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,750
is it just boners

360
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,820
it's boners isn't it also the underworld

361
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,320
is just a hop skip and a jump from this

362
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
very spot we'll definitely get back in

363
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,279
time yay geographical convenience

364
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,170
once again the Jin knows something waits

365
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,520
until it's dramatically convenient to

366
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,230
reveal it and luckily the Jin knows the

367
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,880
rules of the funnel fairy butter bar

368
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,160
also sure was crazy lucky that Zeus gave

369
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,630
Perseus a coin before they came here

370
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,680
well what they have done if he didn't

371
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,790
would they have needed to go on another

372
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,290
quest to rate a vending machine was in

373
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,760
this movie I get that this is supposed

374
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
to be eerie and all but it really just

375
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,459
looks like a second-rate Disney ride

376
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,080
they had an underworld land this would

377
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,550
be the equivalent of the people mover I

378
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,160
cannot assist you their accursed

379
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,140
prevents me you might have mentioned

380
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,730
this to everyone before you actually

381
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:39,700
made it to the River Styx the geezers

382
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,070
killed you twice now Medusa shaming also

383
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,079
the training in this movie one little

384
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,760
scene where someone gives total nonsense

385
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,860
advice somehow it works and we're

386
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,000
supposed to buy it just because he's

387
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,100
Demi Lovato I mean a demigod also also

388
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,570
wouldn't everyone benefit from having

389
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,820
this training easiest oh is this how

390
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,079
they get those boners lasting more than

391
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,940
six hours to go away it's not working

392
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,550
nearly Medusa's lair so long the great

393
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,579
cock-blocker trust you senses don't look

394
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,350
this bitch in the eye Perseus graduated

395
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,459
from the Freddy Krueger school of

396
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,650
name-calling

397
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,480
doesn't really inspire confidence oh so

398
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,750
long you go the scene is so much the

399
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,400
balrog scene and Lord of the Rings I'm

400
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,590
half expecting sir Davos here to say fly

401
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,570
you fools at some point in the battle hi

402
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,280
stuff yeah because she can't move her

403
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,530
face down to where yours is right you

404
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,210
know home turning people into stone

405
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,100
thing her only weapon now you might be

406
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,690
saying guys this is just a movie and I

407
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,790
say welcome to cinema sins I see you're

408
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,870
new here they should have just let this

409
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,420
guy kill Medusa since he's immune to the

410
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,910
Medusa stare if only men could enter her

411
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,680
lair why was this thing that it is not a

412
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,290
human man allowed also kid here explodes

413
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,120
and somehow Medusa manages only to get

414
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,590
minor damage probably because this

415
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,970
asshole let her in on the surprise

416
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,940
before he blew up little Menace there's

417
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,470
virtually no reason man's had to

418
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,570
sacrifice himself here man is it ever

419
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,190
dramatic but seriously nothing he does

420
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,990
gives Perseus an advantage or weakens

421
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,010
Medusa in any way

422
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,480
now the Medusa is dead it should be

423
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,370
noted that none of iowa's training did

424
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,720
anything to help win this battle once

425
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,250
again any movie tries to make us believe

426
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,470
that a guy like cala bassa could sneak

427
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,630
up on and crouched behind a goddess like

428
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,700
io and no one would notice until the guy

429
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,380
stands up none of what we seen from

430
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,730
Perseus in this movie would make him a

431
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,560
good fighter by any stretch but here is

432
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,180
keeping up with a guy with ten times

433
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,040
more experience and infused with Hades

434
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,050
fire vomit nice time to use your gift

435
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,680
from the gods

436
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,690
couldn't use it before every fucking

437
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,580
person that was with you died because of

438
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,020
something something I don't want to use

439
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,360
God things but at least using it now no

440
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,490
way Perseus gets back in time oh the

441
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,320
pegasus this is the clash of the titans

442
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,700
version of the Lord of the Rings Eagles

443
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,980
leave us

444
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,779
release the Kraken why did soos need

445
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,279
everyone to leave before he gave the

446
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,389
order to release the Kraken

447
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,410
would they have stopped him does he

448
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,790
think they wouldn't find out also I

449
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,790
understand zero motivation in this movie

450
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,320
it's my name that calling I don't even

451
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,430
remember who you are

452
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,720
they could be expressing their love of a

453
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,670
Kevin Sorbo show for all I know we need

454
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,779
the love of toons

455
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,500
no you need it I survive on their fear

456
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,000
although the concept of thriving on

457
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,589
abstract human emotions has never made

458
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,209
quite clear by this movie at all maybe

459
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,889
we're surviving based on a good diet and

460
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,440
not smoking there is still a demigod in

461
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,279
Argos why did you tell him that

462
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,560
hey look it's Perseus on a Pegasus tell

463
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,540
Pythagoras I will tell the missus yeah

464
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,060
did Perseus just hi ah this Pegasus can

465
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,620
you hire a mythical creature to make it

466
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,870
fly faster so ends the eight-minute

467
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,459
screen time of the Kraken which was the

468
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:34,509
whole reason you paid money to watch

469
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,699
this movie and yeah he summed up no

470
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,560
doubt that roar was terrifying but to

471
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,180
sit through this whole movie to see him

472
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,940
go out like a chump you also plot of

473
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,620
this movie suggested that only a demigod

474
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,870
could kill the Kraken but what a Perseus

475
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,699
died in the underworld and only Mads was

476
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,990
left are you telling me that Mads

477
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,730
couldn't have shown the Kraken a medusa

478
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,290
head that makes me incredibly balanced

479
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,630
also also how does this Medusa thing

480
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,920
actually work it didn't work on the

481
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,019
Djinn but it did work on humans so why

482
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:00,730
exactly does it work on the Kraken other

483
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,050
than the movie just needs it to

484
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,029
andromeda falls into the water and as we

485
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,410
see her plunge down into it it seems

486
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,180
very convenient that between edits the

487
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,860
movie forgot all about those heavy rocks

488
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,149
that were following her on the way down

489
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,250
I'm a god I will live forever

490
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,209
how did Perseus know that he could

491
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,069
summon lightning to send 80s back to the

492
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,269
underworld was that part of the

493
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,010
conversation between he and Zeus that

494
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,300
didn't make it into the movies final

495
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,279
print the facts are coming for us how

496
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,079
did they even know where to go the

497
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,810
Pegasus tell them I cannot pick Sofia

498
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,279
better isn't mad you can actually be

499
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,560
both but why bother can we roll credits

500
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,100
please

501
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,260
it's mankind who holds the key to hit

502
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,959
his rise and always was well if you can

503
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,699
do that you went well out of your way to

504
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,259
help him out and if you insist on

505
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,779
continuing this mundane human existence

506
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,279
I won't have you do it alone

507
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,399

508
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,439

509
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,720
Doc I assume we call Clash of the Titans

510
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,910
if the gods defeated the Titans and the

511
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,860
Titans aren't in this entire movie then

512
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,400
shouldn't

513
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,470
become Clash of the gods or just maybe

514
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,860
