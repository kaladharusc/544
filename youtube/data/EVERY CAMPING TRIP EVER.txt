Courtney Miller: I love camping. I know it's so nice to just get away from it all and

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,240
Grayson Niles: I know. it's so nice to just get away from it all and unplug and be in nature, you know?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,680
Courtney Miller: Yes.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,260

Ian Hecox: (panting)

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,380
Did somebody order a pizza to the middle of the forest.

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,820
Grayson Niles: Yes, sir! Thank you.

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,260

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,160
Uh oh.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,209
Uh, I really hate to be this guy, but I ordered extra mushrooms.

16
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,840
Courtney Miller: Its kind of important

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,300
Ian Hecox: Oh, I'm sorry, sir and madam, uh, I will have a replacement pizza delivered in five hours.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,460

00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,800
Noah Grossman: Courtney and I were going camping this weekend, and we wanted to know if you would like to join us.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,400
Keith Leak Jr: (pff)

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,940
Hell, no. Camping is creepy.

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,740
Noah Grossman: (chuckle)

28
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,200
It's not creepy.

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,000
You just wander out into the middle of an undeveloped forest somewhere where there's no cell phone reception...

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Courtney Miller: and sleep outside in the dark with only one thin layer of fabric to protect you from the cold,

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,600
Noah Grossman: somewhere where you're completely alone and isolated where hypothetically no one could hear you scream.

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,460
Keith Leak: Jr: Uh, yeah...

33
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,820
no.

34
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,800
No, why don't you guys just invite Grayson instead? Look, he loves camping

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Grayson Niles: That is correct. I do love camping!

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Courtney Miller: But we want you to come.

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:35,440
Keith Leak Jr: Um, no thanks. Gotta go, guys

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,700
Courtney Miller: (nervously) What's that noise in the bushes?

40
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,200
Ian Hecox: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just pooping.

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,780
Noah Grossman: Keisha, I'm nervous.

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,900
Keith Leak Jr: What's wrong, girl?

43
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,460
Noah Grossman: So, I'm going on this camping trip with Troy, but Troy's never seen me without any makeup on.

44
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,380
Keith Leak Jr: (sigh)

45
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,300
Girl, don't be nervous.

46
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,780
Come here. Come here!

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:03,320
Look, see you're going camping for five days, so you can just wear five days worth of makeup

48
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,560
Perfect.

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,660

00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,360
Courtney Miller: Okay, dude, we got everything we need to survive the next seven days.

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,100
Ian Hecox: Bro, you only brought beer and weed.

Ian Hecox: Yeah, it was...

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,940
it was really a good experience. You know, we woke up early and caught the sunrise.

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,780
Ian Hecox: The sun came up!

82
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,300

(cries of torment and suffering)

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,100
Ian Hecox: Yeah, camping is......great.

85
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,800
Grayson Niles: We should go sometime, it'll finally give me a chance to play my new banjo.

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,460
Ian Hecox: NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

87
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,040
Courtney Miller: Oh, look a straight dog.

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,140
Ian Hecox: I think that's a wolf.

89
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,640
Ian Hecox We should probably run.

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,240
Courtney Miller: Oh my G-d!

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,860

These stupid bugs are so freaking annoying. I forgot to pack bug spray.

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,560
Grayson Niles: Ha ha ha, you should have just done what I did.

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,700
Olivia Sui: You laminated your entire body?!

97
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,820
Grayson Niles: Yeah.

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,380
And I don't see... any problems that would arise... from that at all.

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,880
Noah Grossman: So, I thought it would be super cool if for your birthday we went urban camping for a month...

107
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,700

114
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,540
