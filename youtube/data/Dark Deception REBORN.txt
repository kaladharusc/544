00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,020
Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier and welcome to Darkest Dungeon. (smh mark)

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,830
Now I've played this before, but only the early early demo

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,940
In fact, this is a new version that was worked on by the same guy that made Joy of Creation

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,920
Nikson, or at least he worked on part of it... Or a lot of it..

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,640
I think he did the animation for this one, but either way  *spoopy noise in the background*

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,200
This is the new,,,,

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,820
*slowly and unsurely* Dark Dun...

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:28,840
Dark Deception? Never mind. I got that wrong. Dark Deception! Dark Deception...

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,140
It is done.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,060
Now, my faith lies in darkness.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,860
Okay, I don't know if that's the best place for it. But okay.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,200
Oh, hiii :O

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,760
*You have subtitles down there...*                
 . . .

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,840
HeHeHeHello, how are you?
 BIERCE

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Oh, hi! Hello. How are you?

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,820
BIERCE: Oh, another one! How nice to have some company again.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,940
Ahhh, I suppose yes.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,980
BIERCE: Come over here, let's have a look at you.

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,320
I'm kind of already here. I don't know if I need to come any closer..

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,160
BIERCE: You disappoint me, love.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,880
What the hell?!

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,440
BIERCE: You really do.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
I just got here!

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,280
BIERCE: So many fears.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,160
No!

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,600
BIERCE: So many desires...

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,340
Yeah, okay I can't deny that one.

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,860
BIERCE: I thought you'd be bigger.

29
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,980
Okay, you---

30
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,060
*TRIGGERED*

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,000
Bigger.... I thought you'd be bigger

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
Huh?

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,940
Oh, Okay

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,380
Yeah, it sounds about right

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,260
Okay, all right, well you don't have to hit the nail too hard on the head there (&quot;i CoUlD hAvE bEeN An EnGiNeEr&quot;)

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,720
HAH!

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,820
Here you are~ (spoopy darkiplier-like voice)

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,500
No, I don't like this dominatrix thing that's going on I'm not into that

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,720
So if we could just skate on by that before- before something awakens in me that I don't want to (whats was that MARK?)

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,080
Oh?..

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,660
They- wha- Oh Okay

42
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,460
Okay

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,840
I- *confused stuttering*

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,260
I don't know if I want that. That doesn't sound good. Also are you the announcer from Team Fortress 2?

45
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,620
Are you is this like your moonlight job? Just being creepy kind of vampire lady going on. Telling me I'm not BIG enough ;)

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:32,680
Fine then... Buttroom... Bierce's buttroom.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
HO-

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,220
Hello

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,320
You're tall!

50
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,640
What is my wish? I don't even know what my wish is

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,540
Okay, why did I come here in the first place? I'm sorry that I'm only eye level with your boobs!

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,400
Clock's ticking, hang on. Let me get a look at this amazing architecture that you got in here. Love the head of the statue!

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,540
It's awfully nice. Hey, don't look at me like that

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,740
Why you being all-. Oh god. I thought your head was gonna turn all the way around. Oh, it's so pretty!

55
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,380
Why am I here? All right. Okay, I'll go into this. Man, they really revamped this crazy- Okay

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,000
*AHH*

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't know if that was yawn or you're just surprised that I came close.

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,500
I don't like it.

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,220
D- OHHH

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,660
That's do-

61
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,320
*concerned sounds*

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,820
Wimbly, Wombly, Wimbly, Wombly.(WTF? xD) Ah now, that's what I call a door, or a lack of a door...

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,000
That's what I call a hole in the wall

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,570
Oh, okay. Boy they beefed this game up good. Hello monkey business, oh

65
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,000
*concerning chuckles*

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,040
I remember the monkeys. Oh, I remember the monkeys indeed

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,280
Indeed

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,940
Yeah a little bit. Hey are you are you being all meta about the original game because that's pretty cool. Ring for service

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,870
*DING INTENSIFIES*

70
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,750
Hello? Service! I don't know why you'd pop out if he's gonna walk out like an elevator or something like that

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,120
Alright apparently nothing. Welcome breakfast and murder free until 10:00 a.m

72
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:17,020
So it cost money after 10:00 a.m. Do I have to pay for my own murder? Oh you are you are a bag of nightmares

73
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,340
*scared shouting*

74
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,900
Why did that scare me?! You are a shit that didn't scare me!!!  There's no evidence to the contrary! (can we get a replay on that?)

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,240
*R E P L A Y*

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,160
What are you gonna do the same don't you even think about it-

77
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,320
No

78
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,540
N-No

79
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,900
NO

80
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,140
well

81
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,140
This is an odd predicament, but I'm gonna go blindly forward

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,460
Hello friend. How are you doing? Good to see you

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,060
*horrifying shrieks from hell demon*

84
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,440
I'm sorry, I startled you friend

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,320
Oooo~

86
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,620
Okay... a bing bong? No?

87
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,240
All right, then. Well, that was fun. I'm glad I did that. I'm glad we all agreed that that was worth my time (yes, it was)

88
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,540
I'm glad that I'm here.

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,460
(I wouldn't be...XD)

90
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,960
Oh wait

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
*elevator dings*

92
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
*elevator doors opening*

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,940
Ah!

94
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:21,680
Perfect my ride. I'll just hop on in even though.... I was gonna go down wink wonk wink wonk

95
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,620
I don't like it. What have you got? Oh

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,520
Hey it's that statue I like!

97
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:50,360
Yes. Oh, no, those.

98
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,980
Oh

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
HMM!?

100
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,880
OH

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,900
*knocking*

102
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:07,040

Lady listen!

108
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,760
If there's one thing that I don't do its disappoint

109
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,700
I am the master of undisappointation. people always be satisfied when I walk in the room

110
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,100
It's like I do not try to get not

111
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,760
Satisfied challenge when I'm... around

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,340
Okay, so I gotta be somewhat organized about this, I remember what I played this before

113
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,800
Why is that happening?

Lady: How about you don't let them stab you in the face...

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,700
That's not good. That's not good. That's not good. That's not good. Okay, it's fine

130
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,990
There is the enemy but I don't know how long it's gonna be revealed like that

131
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:46,420
Oh, this is where I wass you can't catch me. You can catch me. Oh, you can catch me. Oh

How long are the enemies gonna be revealed for cuz that's awfully handy

135
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,820
Help!

136
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,600
Help I'm warming up. Help I'm warm. Uh-Oh

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,620
Well, I have no enemies revealed, which is probably a bad thing

143
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
*scared shouting*

144
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,100

Hey don't feed into my insecurities like that

148
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,940
I think that people probably like me a lot. My god, this is gonna be difficult

149
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,340
AAAH!! This gonna be difficult cuz they're coming to get me. Oh, I went the wrong way

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,350
Me hoy minoy? No, oh, there was no one coming down that way. I thought there was... turns out there was not.

156
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,300
Uh oh, oh

157
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,880
That's too close for comfort. Oh

158
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,850
Ayyyye. Ayyyye,ayyyye.No bad touch. What is this? I hope it's good

159
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,529
I got it enemies stunned. Yeah, aw stupid you,haa. Get all stupid on you, huh?

160
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:33,490
You is too stupid to come get me stupid. Why you be so dumb you dumb stupid?

161
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:41,050
Huh, you're full of stupid and dumb you all. Oh wait. No are they not stupid? Are they not dumbed?

162
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,980
You're dumb and you stupid you dumb and stupid and dumb full of dumb.

163
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,950
Me am smart big smart with my big brain. (get the reference?) Oh here they come. Can I get another power-up that'd be... that be so nice.

164
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:01,300
Okay, I'm in trouble if I get cut off down this corridor for some reason.

165
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:09,520
Oh shit oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh, we know they were probably coming. Yeah

166
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,420
That was very close. Okay, we're good. We're far away from them now. It's all Gucci baby all Gucci all day.

167
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,440
Oh you think you got me the an– Hey! I'm on fire

168
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,850
Okay, that's good

169
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,920
That's good. I'm gonna get this I'm gonna get this and then I'm gonna get you

170
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,200
Oh, you think you got me? You don't not me not today? Not me. Not today, not me not today

171
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,160
Not me. Not today. It's so funny to see a game

172
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,040
With with like kind of a a little bit of a silly premise. I mean it is it's a game a pac-man

173
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,220
But a terrifying game of pac-man at that

174
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:52,420
But it's funny to see a game like this come into a really really nice remake into it. And I mean, this is free

175
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,320
wop- shit bAH!

176
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,019
No, thank you. You right behind? Oh yeah, you are. I think they might be pissed off at me. Oh, yeah, they're pissed off

177
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,950
Well oooh shit. Oh, oh god. Oh, I have no idea where that is. Okay

178
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,920
Those are the last four I imagine I gotta get those and then I gotta get all the way back to the entrance

179
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,580
But thankfully I'm close to the entrance. So it's like I planned this out... planned this out... with my big brain... where? Where? Where? Where?

180
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,620
Please... don't... cut me off

181
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,079
Don't cut me off

182
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:29,500
Don't cut me off no, don't cut me off I said, please please be open path

183
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,720
I am

184
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,320
So fine, I am FINE

185
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,730
Yes

186
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,380
Go, why?

187
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,400
Whewwee

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,290
Who dares? I dare

189
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,550
I'm trying where's the portal?

190
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,320
Hey, hey listen, listen, buddy, I don't know who you're talking about! Wait, wait! Whoa!

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,780
Whoa. Whoa Oh

192
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,060
Bing bong

193
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,780
That was a little unnecessary you think Mr. Monkey Man

194
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:20,060
Again, I don't know who this lady is. And I don't know what she has to do with this guy-iii... That's pissed off

195
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,340
I AM RUUNIN' OKAY? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WA-

196
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,170
HooOOLy SHIT!

197
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,899
I think there might be some kind of an escape

198
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,948
Mortal go through the portal and you ain't gonna get mortal no more.

199
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:33,460
*Weird santa laugh*

200
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,110
I escaped

201
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,560
That was nice. That was... secrets?

202
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,980
secrets?

203
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,670
Secrets? Ain't that a load of patootie. Oh level two, what does that even mean?

204
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,329
I don't even know what that means, but I got a lot of soul shards

205
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,660
That's a lot of people that died in that place, b-but I got 'em. Oh, hey. Hey, Bierce

206
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,220
You doing you so fierce Bierce. Oh you fierce Bierce. I like you fierce Bierce with your fierce-

207
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,980
uh, necklace

208
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:19,220
Ahh... Your friend's kind of a douche don't mean it's- Uh oh... hello hi, hi nice eye

209
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:26,800
Bierce!

210
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,580
Hmmm...

211
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:41,680
Okay. Now who am I gonna trust; the horrible disembodied veiny eye or the very nice attractive lady?

212
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,300
now *laughs*

213
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,500
the nice attractive ladies who seem to not be too concerned with my death are

214
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,180
Always to be trusted and I don't trust no door. I never trust a door with an eye on it

215
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,040
Doh okay alr-

216
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,660
mnae okay alright...and I will suffer

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:09,220
Oh and I wouldn't suffer from the monkeys

218
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:18,960
But yours can, I bet your powers have so much reach

219
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,760
Yes, ma'am

220
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,520
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,840
well

222
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:41,460
That's okay. I think muscle memory kicks in after a while

223
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:52,580
Malak all right

224
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,970
Or so the legend goes you wouldn't happened to have used this ring at some point

225
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,390
would you have have done that have you?

226
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,300
Guess you might have yes then

227
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Yah yeet I suppose

228
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,140
Hello, lady my god...

229
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,100
Oh yes

230
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,480
I am- eight? Wait, but there's but there's ten portals... My god, you are

231
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,820

232
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:33,010
So... okay, there's a weird yawn thing again... I am SO into you. Also, hey demon guy!

233
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,760
How are you doing?

234
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,440
Okay, I don't like that

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
All right. Well you keep watching pervert

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600

237
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:55,320
What are you doing lady? All right. Well anyway Bierce, hey listen, you know, I'd do anything for you and I mean

238
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,440
AnYtHiNg

239
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,980
Anyway so I'm gonna go on this porta-Ohhhh

240
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah, that's probably fine.

241
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah, let's go for it. Let's see what happens. It's cool.

242
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,800
I hate it. I hate it. I hate that. Nooooo!

243
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,500
It's all done

244
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,960
Noooooo

245
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,850
I can't believe that... that's but... you know, actually thankfully I think I'm okay with that because whatever I'm looking at in front of me

246
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,970
me right now is

247
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,080
Horrible. This is great. I can't believe they'd turn a concept like this into something really amazing

248
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,280
This is legiuhhhh...

249
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,480
No, thank you.

250
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,300
Oh God no. Oh my god, no!

251
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,200
EWEH *disgust*

252
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,700
Back! *laughter into cries of disgust*

253
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:51,359
My god Oh Bierce's Diaries? Oh hell yeah. Oh, but also Vince Livings, Nick &quot;Nikson&quot; Sita

254
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:55,889
Yeah! Daniel Koe, Peter Anderson, Vince Livings, Shun Kim

255
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:02,780
Pen Livings, Gabe Lopez, Melissa Sawicki, Sietske Wielsma, Marcus Williams, Yuri Dholakia... all these wonderful people

256
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,520
Thank you so much for working on this. I can't wait to see what comes next because this is some good stuff

257
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,130
You've got here! And the first part was free!

258
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:17,449
I imagine they'd probably charge something for this game because this is really nicely made. So hopefully it gets fully made sometime soon

259
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:24,260
So thank you everybody so much for watching. You can check out the game in the description below, and as always, I'll see you

260
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,900
in the next video.

261
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,980
Buh bye!

262
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:39,000
