I remember when you were first built babies with the inlaws we're going to

72
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,260
the mall really quickly to pick up a couple of things that were probably

75
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,380
wrong

76
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,880
looks like someone's pulling multiplies pulling there is a canvas pooling

77
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,499

80
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:51,140

and then we're done with shopping for the night

85
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:23,090
okay yeah what decided that women were the one that had to have hair torn on

86
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,130
our body highlighted cut colored well why don't we do that

87
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:34,669
editorial what we do it that we have to look attractive for men sometimes like

88
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,270
that like what you just said could have been like you're headed down this road

89
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,490
of feminists and tower feminist and then you just pulled a 180 at the very end

90
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:52,490
and would shatter the whole thing but you always make me feel like I stole my

91
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,450
own car

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,150
no I just kids telling me you're nervous about nervous are you nervous at all a

93
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,880
little bit what are you nervous about this being away
