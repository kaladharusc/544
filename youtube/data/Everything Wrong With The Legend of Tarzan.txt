[Music]

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,650
almost a full minute of reading

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,809
goddamnit in a Tarzan movie in case you

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,009
confused it with the North American

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,990
Congo this white guy invading Africa war

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,640
white suit to further emphasize his

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,529
whiteness but he's carrying a Catholic

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,150
rosary type necklace thing so clearly

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,930
he's a good guy

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,000
I think unless he's a priest wait what

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
did I say that I don't think I did

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,720
trotty shop shouting that you are ready

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,130
so your enemy knows your status in

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,470
position one spear comes out of the fog

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,450
they fire and seconds later dozens of

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,739
natives can be seen lying on the rocks

17
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,450
when my point is goddamn that fog

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,160
cleared quickly no one notices this

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,750
obvious breathing tube bamboo balls

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,550
because no one is paying attention but

21
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,590
me apparently a sudden crucifixions this

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,090
apparent indigenous leader is wearing a

23
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,440
leopard print costume that looks like it

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,940
came from Party City these white face

25
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,469
Africans are so good at surprise attack

26
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,910
in heavily armed soldiers you think

27
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,530
they've been trained for it or expected

28
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,699
it but read the script and knew it

29
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,110
needed some added tension the old power

30
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,430
Warriors decide not to kill this man

31
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,899
because he is clearly Academy Award

32
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,520
winner Christoph Waltz ban must be an

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,870
important character in this story

34
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,210
Tarzan 300 that this old dude would be

35
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,530
this good at fighting after he hit like

36
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,270
a bitch during the real fight feel bad

37
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,010
for gemenon soo because he's almost

38
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,570
always cast as either the villain or the

39
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,979
super African guy and neither role

40
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,390
really does his acting ability justice

41
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,990
chief vaanga hive resumed wait what you

42
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,430
knew the name of this tribes chief but

43
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,259
instead of trying to open talks you just

44
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,549
let all your men be slaughtered how do

45
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,470
you know my name how do you know English

46
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,500
there's one thing a desire above all

47
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,040
else

48
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,220
stop billing bring him to me you shall

49
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,079
have your diamonds I could defeat you

50
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,820
and your troops easily yet I still think

51
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,320
you stand a better chance against Tarzan

52
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,090
than I do for some reason all I need is

53
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,770
a name cool movie moment just before the

54
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,659
Tarzan title screen but still you need

55
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,610
way more than a name dude you need a

56
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,710
description a location a general rundown

57
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,540
on skills and previous attacks did you

58
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,159
really have to include a little circle

59
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,810
our registered trademark on this movie's

60
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,340
title screen because if you did I'm not

61
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,110
sure if I'm more upset at you or u.s.

62
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,790
trademark law but either way it's overly

63
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,710
obvious and stupidest not to be confused

64
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,360
with London West Virginia wait there's

65
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,950
actually a London West Virginia well

66
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,469
utter fucking waste of Jim Broadbent

67
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,210
here's samuel l.jackson cracking walnuts

68
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,920
conspicuously in continuing his streak

69
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,299
of appearing in everything movie ever

70
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,650
made let me explain

71
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,990
the Africa situation strapped in

72
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,840
everyone this may take a while you are

73
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,630
Tarzan lord of the Apes king of the

74
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,790
jungle wait is this a fucking sequel why

75
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,320
didn't anyone tell me this changes

76
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,750
nothing he sent my apologies to serene

77
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,100
Highness movie wants me to believe

78
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,140
Tarzan isn't going back to Africa even

79
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,310
though the trailer showed me he does

80
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,870
indeed go back which makes this some

81
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,730
bull time-wasting bull right here you

82
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,780
can tell it's England because of how

83
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,070
much it's raining even in this live

84
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,330
action movies flashbacks

85
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,800
Tarzan's parents managed to build an

86
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,390
absolute palace in the treetops of

87
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,950
Africa where they crash-landed because

88
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,420
Tarzan's parents are Jesus level

89
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,490
carpenters I've done all I can to

90
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,320
protect them except not bring them to

91
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,180
Africa also the either brought an infant

92
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,709
a pregnant wife or knocked her up after

93
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,120
being stranded in the jungle none of

94
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,220
those are good ideas the jungle consumes

95
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,170
everything except English babies

96
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,230
obviously today I buried my Alice

97
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,090
I guess he bared his Alice went up to

98
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,500
the treehouse to write the diary entry

99
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,360
and came back down to grieve slash died

100
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,990
by gorilla

101
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,240
you brought your a baby on this raid the

102
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,820
four oh so it's not a sequel it's a

103
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,620
reboot masquerading as a sequel but

104
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,150
doing the reboot stuff in the flashbacks

105
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,230
brilliant yes we here Jane teaching the

106
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,400
kids about the power of the hippo

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,750
because later in the movie she will be

108
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,190
attacked by a hippopotamus how many

109
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,840
children would have now somehow this

110
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,459
movie managed to top Anakin and Padme

111
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,530
for insipid couples dialog any course

112
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,900
it's just a diplomat bring I can't take

113
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,880
you movie again waste time on some

114
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,959
bullshit we know will be overturned

115
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,640
shortly because the movie literally has

116
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,050
nothing new to offer save a few extra

117
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,209
courses the last thing you need is small

118
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,160
stress yeah and leaving her here at home

119
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,930
alone while you go would never cause her

120
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,030
any stress right hyper dicing coconuts

121
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,950
and playing ping-pong pretty goddamn

122
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,570
sure no one in the 1800's cultic

123
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,340
ping-pong it was table tennis or nothing

124
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,900
in fact I just googled it and while the

125
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,580
film takes place in roughly 1890 the

126
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,019
term ping-pong wasn't invented until the

127
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,120
very end of the century try to keep me

128
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,370
here won't work 20 minutes in in this

129
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,019
Tarzan movie is basically an episode of

130
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,370
parenthood you can take the boy out of

131
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,810
the jungle but you can't take the raw

132
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,400
egg drinking jungle technique out of the

133
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,140
bleep what the fuck also this movie

134
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,070
couldn't have happened to a more

135
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,840
likeable skarsgård I was happier in

136
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,030
Africa cliche also that's a real crisp

137
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,070
image for an 1880s photograph honest

138
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,080
question aren't there no horses how in

139
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,030
the ever-loving did anyone in Africa in

140
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,950
early 1890s managed to make this banner

141
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,560
just what keeping a CGI crocodile as a

142
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,359
pet also acting shocked by the terrain

143
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,739
full of ivory when you literally have a

144
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:20,950
slave holding an umbrella

145
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,540
you you thought the ivory trade was bad

146
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,580
today well no Kings payment was due

147
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,470
three months ago I tried that trick with

148
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,000
my student loans once didn't work

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,230
I feel like this happy reunion would

150
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,550
carry more weight if we had a first

151
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,320
movie telling the origin story and this

152
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,060
was a sequel about the return instead

153
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,620
this movie is trying to be both and this

154
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,030
reunion just feels weird we formal

155
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,980
enforced known as antennae until every

156
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,110
time and if you'd never returned we were

157
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,760
prepared to eternally waste this very

158
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,650
useful large shelter also we thought

159
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,330
that if you did return you'd prefer to

160
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,250
see it wasted away abandoned and totally

161
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,200
messy as as opposed to seeing eat and

162
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,120
tidy or having been useful to others in

163
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,890
your absence Anini openness you fought

164
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,600
to abandon bucking gala bezel do they

165
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
not always have sentries out some once

166
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,020
you tell them about the Lions this is

167
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,520
just like the ghost in the darkness only

168
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,960
with fewer deadly lions and more Sam

169
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,030
Jackson sometimes I look back on the

170
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,290
last few years of my life and I'm just

171
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,790
grateful to be doing a job where you get

172
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,020
to write and then narrate utterly

173
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,490
bonkers sentences like that one on

174
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,290
average a full-grown male gorilla weighs

175
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,120
about 350 pounds making it quite

176
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,860
difficult for them to use vines - Spider

177
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,390
Man style swing through the jungle they

178
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,650
would pull those vines right out of the

179
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,040
trees

180
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,990
since no man never started with less

181
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,660
weight what he was born in Africa his

182
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,980
parents died and then a magically

183
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,630
generous eight female took him as her

184
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,340
own son and raised him before we'd go on

185
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,020
to inherit massive wealth I'd agree the

186
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,550
loss of his parents is tragic but plenty

187
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,470
of men have started with less symbolism

188
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,060
aside it's literally impossible by the

189
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,440
laws of physics for her to be this well

190
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,180
lit from behind without us being able to

191
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,650
see anything around her in front of her

192
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,450
what's right here in the ruins of your

193
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,580
childhood home 37 minutes in still no

194
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,740
Tarzan II also hey you just made love in

195
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,480
a bed in a house no one has entered in a

196
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,220
decade or more exactly how much disease

197
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,350
do you have now I mean little feets are

198
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,000
toxic at this point right no way

199
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,160
whatever love conquers only the man who

200
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,630
can take on full-grown gorillas and

201
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,070
leopards is thwarted by a group of

202
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,990
regular humans Tarzan hasn't chewed

203
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,250
through this netting yet to go rescue

204
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,960
his wife he currently sees being abused

205
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,790
must have been something the first

206
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,670
moment I saw her I fell the Negras and

207
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,340
baboons super racist dude do you not

208
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,080
watch the number since oh no we're being

209
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,270
shot at quick let's all stand here he

210
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,770
tells Jane he needs her to scream she

211
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,150
spits on him and then he says it's no

212
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,600
big deal

213
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,530
Tarzan will come for her regardless

214
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,270
which makes me wonder who thought the

215
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,530
spitting scene was ultimately necessary

216
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,410
oh I'm really sad that guy's dead but

217
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,120
who's that guy again

218
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,419
I think I'm gonna barf

219
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:33,220
if you would just your eyes just what

220
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,560
left you in England and your castle well

221
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,840
yes ping yes if you've done that neither

222
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,340
of our two gorgeous white lead actors

223
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,240
would be in trouble right now

224
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
we'll be the lights in an excessive

225
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,480
flamingo butchery scene because movie is

226
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,580
a grade-a dick face amazing CGI

227
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,800
butterfly a hopefulness you do know that

228
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,690
the right side of your moustache is just

229
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,000
a little lower than the left this is

230
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
obviously a psychological attack on

231
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,120
Jane's part but damn it if she's not

232
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,770
right movie saves money by borrowing

233
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,139
b-roll from medicine man yes I did just

234
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:00,580
reference the Sean Connery disaster

235
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,290
medicine man is my critique less on

236
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,330
point because of it no it is not if we

237
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,620
spin the camera enough maybe Knoll

238
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,630
notice how CGI the ship this Tarzan

239
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,580
movie waits until the 50 minute mark to

240
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,530
even begin attempting to Tarzan magic

241
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,479
finds attached to nothing the snow-free

242
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,010
snowpiercer bullfight would be

243
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,300
entertaining if I could figure out why

244
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,979
not one of these armed soldiers even

245
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,930
tries firing a gun at him oh that guy

246
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,940
shot a gun roughly 10 seconds too late I

247
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,530
would take back my previous sin but I

248
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,450
still think it kind of stands those are

249
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,180
some added big earlobes you got this son

250
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,770
that guy's earlobes are actually quite

251
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,419
small and certainly not large enough to

252
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,100
warrant this comment which tells me no

253
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,479
one checked the script for accuracy

254
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,919
between the table read and the casting

255
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,990
of extras huzzah for cheap filmmaking

256
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,120
standards this is some poke on it right

257
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,450
here

258
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,860
guess she painted with all the colors of

259
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,300
the wind or something Tarzan survives

260
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,010
this first of all wasn't that a dream

261
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,570
second of all Tarzan gets beat to hell

262
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,550
by a gorilla then carried to a healing

263
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,440
building by the natives and even if this

264
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,300
is an extended flashback how does this

265
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,130
movie think it has time for the suppose

266
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,750
a jungle fine dining setup does not

267
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,220
include salt and pepper shakers no

268
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,169
seasoning for you my priest purchased it

269
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,900
for me in Jerusalem when I was nine that

270
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,010
sounds like you and your priests were

271
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,110
awfully close religious pedophilia jokes

272
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,580
about the Catholic Church were all the

273
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,950
rage in the 1890s duh would you pass the

274
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,250
pepper

275
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,750
there's no pepper on this table but

276
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,639
still he gets up and find some he and

277
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,870
prisons are just long enough to get the

278
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,729
pepper and then releases a wrist because

279
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,289
this guy is fucking with her or with us

280
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,940
the viewers but honestly at this point

281
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,470
doesn't matter I'm rooting for the Jesus

282
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,720
but everyone can relate to a lowborn

283
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,610
scrapper movie takes a great actor and

284
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,350
totally Hayden Christensen's him what

285
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,500
did Tarzan do killed his only son is

286
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,240
this girl even on Tarzan's side why the

287
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,070
she's just volunteering information to

288
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,240
this obvious asshat

289
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,810
and get ready because that is nothing

290
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,550
compared to what he will do to you just

291
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,870
kind of recently showered Lindsay Lohan

292
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,320
is right

293
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,980
Tarzan's gonna

294
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,660
cue up worse than Brad Pitt did yo if

295
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,280
you need an evil handsome man to have an

296
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,290
unsettlingly civilized meal with a woman

297
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,000
he's terrorizing Christoph Waltz's your

298
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,130
guy I never left a friend in trouble

299
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,080
or pardon in the lurch I'm not about to

300
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,420
start now yeah but what's in your wallet

301
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,520
so how you want to play this lead will

302
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,620
come down well fight

303
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,030
that's exactly how Chris and I settle

304
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,620
our disputes my wife just informed me

305
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,970
that this is a good movie now well

306
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,260
watching this fight makes me want to

307
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,880
immediately apologize to Marvel movies

308
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,350
for my constant ripping on their over

309
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,580
edited clothes of fight scenes

310
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,010
Jesus this is incomprehensible again how

311
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,200
did the modern rised on Apes movies get

312
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,450
Apes oh right only for all other movies

313
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,860
involving Apes to get the Apes so wrong

314
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,110
and faking this bite gets infected

315
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,940
you're gonna have problems because up

316
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,800
until now we've had no problems you

317
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,230
aren't going anywhere until we get this

318
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,960
stitched up by ants also they didn't

319
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,100
show his wounds being cleaned or

320
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,600
sterilized so the rest of this movie is

321
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,430
about Tarzan superpower of not dying

322
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,320
from certain infection eating them

323
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,290
tastes like bacon Oh ladies and

324
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,880
gentlemen comedy no one will be seated

325
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,200
during the elephants show up for no

326
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,420
reason whatsoever scene aka fantastic

327
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,740
beasts and how to use them to pad your

328
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,240
runtime not that I feel qualified to

329
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,980
share any kidnapping tips but why not

330
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,540
chained her up somewhere inside the boat

331
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,670
Chekhov's hippopotamuses Oh shocker

332
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,140
he now you cede me his way out of this

333
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,450
cage utterly shot I'm sorry I can't keep

334
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,160
this Rosa I'm not really surprised by

335
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,170
any of this hungry hungry hippo oh great

336
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,520
she's run smack into the Apes whose

337
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,010
leader just Cantrell Tarzan awesome

338
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,270
how much you want about Tarzan shows up

339
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,130
and saves this ballsy evil bastard walks

340
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,960
toward the Apes and somehow doesn't get

341
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,640
torn to shreds or eaten or anything that

342
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,720
might keep him from appearing in the

343
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,160
film's finale even though these same

344
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,660
Apes just beat the hell out of Tarzan

345
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,780
himself whatever movie you suck balls

346
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,910
promise you won't hurt them why in the

347
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,350
name of stupidity would you trust this

348
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,770
assholes promises Jesus it took less

349
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,540
than 15 seconds for his men to prove why

350
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,770
she shouldn't have trusted them and

351
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,200
where the stars on right now hey Tarzan

352
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,030
while you're listening to with dead ants

353
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,560
in your shoulder if you just stay put

354
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,820
you probably could have saved Jane by

355
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,740
now oh you like them apples son of actor

356
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,880
who was in the movie I'm quoting with

357
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,490
the apples thing

358
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,360
Tarzan may have grown up in the jungle

359
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,710
but there's no reason he should have

360
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,660
superhuman hearing also if he can hear

361
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,010
Jane shouldn't he be able to hear the

362
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,630
thousand other jungle sounds going on in

363
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,920
between them and here is where the

364
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,660
animated Disney Tarzan merges with this

365
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,280
supposed live-action version told you

366
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,780
he'd save her from this crap god I hate

367
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,580
being right off this no fake-ass looking

368
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,020
CGI Apes were actually harmed in the

369
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,670
making of this so-called movie during

370
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,290
this I just saved an ape and oh my God

371
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,700
look at all the dead Apes moment I'd

372
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,110
like to point out once again that he has

373
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,670
ants in his shoulder instead of stitches

374
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,650
I just beat your ass 15 minutes ago but

375
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,960
now let's be allies yes Sam Jackson's

376
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,340
character is still all by himself and

377
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,870
still not yet eaten by any of the

378
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,490
animals in this deadly jungle and yes

379
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,410
that is a random upside-down umbrella in

380
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,880
the shot though I actually have no

381
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,750
explanation for that

382
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,770
I guess he's covering ground already

383
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,270
covered by Jane and then I don't know

384
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,740
the umbrella is really weird this

385
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,210
flashback to an African tribal dude

386
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,740
shooting an ape is both confusing and

387
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,110
confusing Jai monsoon is like goddamn I

388
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,220
only have a few minutes of screen time

389
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,300
here why does all of it have to be

390
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,950
blurry wait I thought all that with the

391
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,270
arrow killing the ape was a flashback

392
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,130
but it wasn't and I'm just like what the

393
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,180
fuck is going on movie

394
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,800
do you even know bloodless stabbed

395
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
killings this force of hundreds that

396
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,070
could easily overwhelm him just stands

397
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,630
here watching while he beats their asses

398
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,220
one at a time this only happens in the

399
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,900
movies folks this were real Tarzan is

400
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,280
dead and Jane is sold to a Crypt Keeper

401
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,350
in Thailand Williams who is anywhere

402
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,240
from 40 to 70 years old and doesn't have

403
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,340
an army a boat a map skills an animal

404
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,780
training or basically any jungle

405
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,250
survival skills whatsoever makes it to

406
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,930
the final battle on his own Tarzan gets

407
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,340
his ass kicked again which shouldn't

408
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,350
happen twice in a Tarzan movie your son

409
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,330
kill the UNA passion I have a cat about

410
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,030
me oh so it was kind of a flashback at

411
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,500
some point there but I really stopped

412
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,150
caring so can we please get on with it

413
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,130
my son was just a boy no like you where

414
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,360
was your honor

415
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,010
John doesn't know he's in the movie so

416
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,300
he just keeps acting the fuck out of his

417
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,310
scenes once in all eyes at the planet of

418
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,470
the ex machina didn't he just get

419
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,000
speared in the kidney they literally go

420
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,410
from fighting these guys to instantly

421
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,940
talking them into joining the anti rom

422
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,530
calls because this movie is almost 2

423
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,820
hours long but still felt the need to

424
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,440
stretch out the boring and speed up the

425
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,820
interesting remember back when the

426
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,080
English children were fawning over a

427
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,730
chance to feel Tarzan's bulbous hands

428
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,800
that feels extra pointless right now now

429
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,300
that we are racing through the climax

430
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,670
take this row upon row of 10th base

431
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,320
fakeness where you going

432
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,970
get some friends because I was an

433
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,530
adopted ape once all the creatures of

434
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,060
Africa love and respect and follow me a

435
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,440
guy with a gun and a screaming gorilla

436
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,180
well now a herd stampeding wildebeest

437
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,830
because of course they will Tarzan

438
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,300
is running about 50 miles an hour right

439
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,950
now someone should show him how to fire

440
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,950
that gun the running of the wildebeest

441
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,890
1886 model Maxim machine gun father do

442
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,960
you know oh god damn it just and I get

443
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,490
this movie the quadruple bird that's

444
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,200
both middle fingers and both middle toes

445
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,900
everyone survives this ok he saved his

446
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,640
lady the evil men are leaving so it's

447
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,230
Tarzan motivated purely by revenge at

448
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,610
this point does he really need to kill

449
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,410
rom before he can find peace he does

450
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,910
this instead of reaching up to breaking

451
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,290
the line or breaking the fucking boat

452
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,270
Tarzan is strong and almost a superhero

453
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,010
but he's dumber than a box of rocks yeah

454
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,790
I could do that

455
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,530
my neck is that strong I just waited a

456
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,240
while to do it to build suspense at

457
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,100
least six Crocs feeding on ROM and yet

458
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,260
still no blood that's weird right movie

459
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,640
once you to think Tarzan was still on

460
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,140
the ship when it blew up but this is a

461
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,090
movie mere moments from the end so if

462
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,500
you have half a brain you're just

463
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,090
annoyed by this bull stalling tactic

464
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,650
what did I tell you huh this is

465
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,480
paint-by-numbers moviemaking folks have

466
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,070
you ever seen a movie before even just

467
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,780
one then you could have made this movie

468
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,600
we have witnesses documents letters and

469
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
official record and enslavement of the

470
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
Congolese peep and the king of Belgium

471
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,630
agreed with the open letter and no

472
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,980
atrocities happened to the Congolese

473
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,780
people ever again it's pretty much never

474
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,310
a good sign when a movie that is 10

475
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,930
minutes from ending including credits

476
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,580
gives you a one year later title card

477
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,840
it's the very definition of not

478
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,580
necessary ah they're doing they're

479
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,440
having a baby dance Jane had a baby and

480
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,850
that was totally worth attacked on one

481
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:20,680
year later Bulls right

482
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,110
that guy hasn't done anything yet you

483
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,480
get on gonna do something and you know

484
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,710
it's gonna be good

485
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,370
these will you came for this is what you

486
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,810
came for

487
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,560
I pray that someone will save you

488
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,480
