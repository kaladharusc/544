1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,769
20 seconds of darkness followed by a

2
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,809
full minute of 70 millimetres snowy

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,580
landscape porn look I like Quentin

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,049
Tarantino you probably like Quentin

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,730
Tarantino too but quitting Tarantino

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,199
likes quitting Tarantino more than we do

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,520
who gives us this is his eighth film

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,900
also you're backtracking through your

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,949
head and wondering why this is the

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,390
eighth then not the 9th because he

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,369
considers Kill Bill all one movie but we

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,199
still can't get Kill Bill as one movie

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,829
ok we can wait um just have no choice

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,050
so wait that wasn't even a church just a

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,399
random crucifix in the middle of nowhere

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
also I wouldn't even question this if

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,520
Tarantino didn't show it to me for 3

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,040
damn minutes waiting yeah for one moment

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
or Cui's think so be can hear him ask

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,070
this question slightly above a whisper

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,379
trying to bring a cup of no goods in the

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,390
market and by taking these no goods off

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,770
of his curb and putting them in the road

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,360
presumably so he has a place to sit

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,039
mark we screed unnecessary work for

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,590
himself damn blasted Blizzard has been

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,539
on our ass for the last three hours

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,600
and they're continuing to outrun it

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,460
Tarantino uses the term black fella for

30
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,869
more queefs in the scene because he's

31
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,490
saving up for another term he will later

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,799
use and accepts you take them to guns a

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
years and you lay them on that rock over

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,310
yonder Kurt Russell landed this role

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,689
based on his impression of John Wayne

36
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,549
okay boy we'll give it a try are we

37
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,990
supposed to believe that John Ruth is

38
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,549
some sort of kind-hearted Samaritan here

39
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,110
there's no way in hell he trusts warrant

40
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,490
and giving him a ride gives him

41
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,869
absolutely nothing maybe he knows

42
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,729
there's a plot later

43
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,829
Daisy must have a steel plate in her

44
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,329
head because after a hit like that I

45
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,530
don't think she could immediately get up

46
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,369
and start talking again

47
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,140
Tarantino his foot flesh has gone too

48
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,939
far or sport it hasn't been too long

49
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,320
since they were out the snow and I

50
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,640
assume their stagecoach doesn't have a

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,960
heater in it so they should still have

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,310
snow on their hats and jackets this

53
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,810
movie is so anti-littering mark we

54
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,159
Stroh's have recently lit still

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,720
potentially flammable match on the floor

56
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,009
of a wooden stage coat instead of

57
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,040
outside in the snow rains davanon like a

58
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,730
man

59
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,280
I know that Daisy is looking ahead to

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,330
when her family comes and tries to

61
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,280
rescue her but she has to know after all

62
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,660
the abuse she's taken she's going to get

63
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,220
punched by John every time she says

64
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,210
something like this right

65
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,530
what is her endgame for getting tortured

66
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,270
I am subjected to watching Daisy lick

67
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,150
blood off her face for 37 seconds

68
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,300
Quentin

69
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,950
you have any Oh Morricone at your

70
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,150
disposal and you'd rather play this

71
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,830
anachronistic pop song I'm gonna add

72
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,150
three sins for that either I've

73
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,380
underestimated mid 19th century

74
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,390
Wyoming's ability to plow snow or this

75
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,280
is simple you still got it John Ruth

76
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,780
plays the pronoun game so that Warren

77
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,280
has to ask what the hell it means and

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,930
this is just one of the letters knowing

79
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,460
what we find out later this so-called

80
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,870
Lincoln letter is a forgery

81
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,430
Lauren sure does go to prestige level

82
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,540
commitment when it comes to being

83
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,070
protective about it they was pen pals

84
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,960
John says that Lincoln and more Cui's

85
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,550
are pen pals even though that term was

86
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,840
coined in the late 1930s

87
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
mark we sponges Daisy out of the

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,570
stagecoach just at the right time so

89
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,830
that they can run into yet another

90
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,030
person who can help out with the plot

91
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,520
that view Chris Mannix Wyoming is a

92
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,170
pretty big place the likelihood of John

93
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,000
being two-for-two of knowing people he

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,620
runs into is pretty slim you're the

95
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,110
hangman bobrucz my lord is that really

96
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,540
the real head of major Marquess looking

97
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,200
at me now

98
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,940
and there's PT Barnum and Louisa May

99
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,980
Alcott so I'm supposed to freeze to

100
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,720
death cause you find something hard to

101
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,209
believe no I suppose not it seems like

102
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,500
John just had a stroke it's the only

103
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,580
thing I can think of that would explain

104
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,050
his sudden compassion for this guy he

105
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,340
doesn't seem to care for does he know

106
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,320
how famous you want well it's convenient

107
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,730
these characters don't know just enough

108
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,080
about each other for an explanation to

109
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,730
be necessary you ain't never heard a

110
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,350
well in bet president wall camped West

111
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,180
Virginia West Virginia was a union state

112
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,680
that broke away from Virginia because

113
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,910
those counties didn't want to be a part

114
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,410
of the Confederacy making it a key

115
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,790
border state for the Union which would

116
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,260
make having a Confederate prison or war

117
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,000
camp there highly unlikely even though

118
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
it's not impossible just kind of a bad

119
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,850
choice to put your fictional prison when

120
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,020
there are plenty of other Confederate

121
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,080
states to choose from you will because

122
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,730
when Bob walked out a bit ago it shot

123
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,590
just fine Tim Roth isn't Christoph Waltz

124
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,150
in this sink let's just say I don't like

125
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,709
cheating a hangman he got to make a

126
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,480
living - does the hangman get paid per

127
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,670
hang legitimately don't know it seems

128
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,780
like that would create a conflict of

129
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,489
interest we watched them do this in real

130
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,350
time for no reason other than Tarantino

131
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,970
has this seventy millimeter camera and

132
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,530
he's gonna use it goddamn it I prefer to

133
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,760
carry the rods and rope along with me

134
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,230
rather than go back and forth in a

135
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,489
blizzard either someone is trying to

136
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:06,170
make a bead curtain out of chains or I'm

137
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,470
just

138
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,760
completely ignorant as to why someone

139
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,290
would eat all those hanging there either

140
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,820
way I'm counting it as a city you'd

141
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,530
attract with it being conducted held it

142
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,630
does Oswaldo already know about maurices

143
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,680
Lincoln letter the only way he could

144
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,030
know is if Ruth somehow I told him about

145
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,380
it while they were off-camera for no

146
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,270
reason any sane person can think of Tim

147
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,440
Ralph did his character study by

148
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,850
watching Monty Python for several days

149
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,200
where the hell is this light coming from

150
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,850
there's a huge blizzard outside so it's

151
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,290
definitely not sunlight I guess Mindy

152
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,520
got a time machine travelling to the

153
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,930
Future brought floodlights back with her

154
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,330
and I thought poor taco Oh red apple

155
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,890
you're the thin thread that barely makes

156
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,450
all the Tarantino movies somehow part of

157
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,400
the same world is that general Sanford

158
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,140
Smithers I see there must be only like

159
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,730
20 people in all of Wyoming because

160
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,350
there's at least one person who has some

161
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,580
connection with a person they just met

162
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,720
which is very helpful when we the

163
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,070
viewers don't know who anyone is in the

164
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,170
first place respect

165
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,550
did he make Bruce Dern swallow gravel

166
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,620
for the state if the man a lozenge we

167
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,440
divide all inside and this is having a

168
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,060
Brit decide how we divide up geography

169
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,310
always leads to trouble

170
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,810
knives don't make ringing sounds as

171
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,430
they're pulled through the air I'm gonna

172
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,770
cut you loose wha whe mr. John's

173
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,270
suspicious of everyone roof over here

174
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,100
decides to uncuff Daisy because he's

175
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,020
overdue for a lapse in judgment comes

176
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,730
with some of them mean bastards out

177
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,410
there it's the only thing does the job

178
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,270
you really only need to hang mean

179
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,540
bastards but mean bastards you need this

180
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,280
is that classic Tarantino tell you like

181
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,930
it is style of dialogue but sometimes

182
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,490
Tarantino's dialogue is repetitive but

183
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,510
being repetitive is something

184
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,100
Tarantino's dialogue does sometimes I

185
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,240
don't know if tension is supposed to be

186
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,530
building right now but it feels more

187
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,669
like I'm watching a very boring episode

188
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,550
of frontier big brother John Abraham

189
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,020
this sums up the movie to me moments

190
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,760
masqueraded its tension but in reality a

191
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,890
repetitive issue but ain't nobody in

192
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,260
Minnie's haberdashery ever correspondent

193
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,540
with Abraham Lincoln you want to know

194
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,550
why I lie about something like that

195
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,410
white man got me on that stagecoach

196
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,690
didn't it did it though I thought it was

197
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,160
the agreement between you and John about

198
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
protecting your respective bounties but

199
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,860
that was so long ago now who the hell

200
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,380
knows young woman fevered cooker star

201
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,540
slash winner spenders wouldn't be caught

202
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,070
dead talking to a black person minutes

203
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,810
ago but now he shared personal details

204
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,100
about his left

205
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,710
boy in the middle of Wyoming hiding away

206
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,790
from a blizzard in a remote location

207
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,680
Warren runs into the father of a guy he

208
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,040
killed

209
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
it's interesting how Marquess and the

210
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,890
naked guy are able to be here then cross

211
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,300
the railroad tracks then end up where

212
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,860
they were originally and suddenly we're

213
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,120
next to this river Wyoming is a

214
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,250
confusing place he's just a sneaking

215
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,960
trying to get you to go for that gun

216
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,540
racism aside and he's right and for some

217
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,710
reason Smith Lewis doesn't take this

218
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,960
statement more seriously I pulled my big

219
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,850
black pecker

220
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,190
ID my pants there are two things that I

221
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,390
generally don't want to happen at the

222
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,800
same time when I go see a movie

223
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
Sam Jackson talked about his big black

224
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,890
pecker and the camera begins tilting

225
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,330
down as he does it this is a story of

226
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,040
general Smithers son it was so good at

227
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
oral sex he could do it on a Floyd

228
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,780
clothed man shot Oh Ned Wong black

229
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,620
dingus

230
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,350
dingus about 15 minutes is passes okay

231
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,910
add five sins for throwing a narration

232
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,100
over halfway through this damn movie

233
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,180
also instead of trimming some of the fat

234
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,320
down from earlier in this movie

235
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
Tarantino decided it would be better for

236
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,780
him to just tell us what happened

237
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,400
instead of writing more dialogue Captain

238
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
Chris Mannix found the dead generals

239
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,820
code that is inexplicably without bullet

240
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,440
holes and bloodstains even though he was

241
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,760
shot wearing that code 15 minutes

242
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,250
earlier yeah Mannix who apparently

243
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,810
worshiped general Smithers is totally

244
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,370
fine that he's dead and is acting like I

245
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,880
never happened

246
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,160
Bob enjoy demands Anna Roja calm down

247
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,640
Quintin

248
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
Russell really smashed up an antique

249
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,490
guitar from the 1870s right there that's

250
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,110
Jennifer Jason Leigh legit freaking out

251
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,640
the sin is not telling Kurt Russell

252
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,900
about the guitar we're not stopping the

253
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,550
scene to switch out the replica or using

254
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,020
a priceless antique in a guitar smashing

255
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,880
scene in the first place this Lewin way

256
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,520
there holy Sh that hasn't been slowed

257
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,780
way down already I don't think I could

258
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,770
make it through the rest of this picture

259
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,470
now many like just about everybody but

260
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,060
she showed don't Magnus but why is it so

261
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,710
that Warren could one day solve a murder

262
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,090
Agatha Christie style that's such an

263
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,620
oddly specific prejudice which just

264
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,760
happens to play into the hands of this

265
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,350
plot even though mark we shoot senior

266
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,400
Bob in the belly at the blood spatter

267
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,600
comes out below his shoulder getting

268
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,370
shot in the dick again so Channing Tatum

269
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,720
is underneath the floorboards what took

270
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,860
him so long to start shooting fools

271
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,120
there were plenty of chances when he

272
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,230
could have killed John and anybody else

273
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,030
he wanted before got to the scene all

274
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,750
right I did it

275
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,040
there was hardly a reason to keep the

276
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,420
hoop boys and the coffee thing a secret

277
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,860
if one of the guys was just gonna admit

278
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,520
it at gunpoint

279
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,990
it was some pretty cool sleuthing going

280
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,370
on there for a bit eliminating all the

281
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,510
people who couldn't have done it but

282
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,190
this review is as satisfying as finding

283
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,419
out there's new Transformers movie

284
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:23,780
coming

285
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,890
nearly two minutes of a stagecoach

286
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,780
driving to minis that we already know

287
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,370
let's see some faces let's give some

288
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,650
names at no point during this scene does

289
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,030
many supposed he 'tried of Mexicans

290
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,800
surface not even a dirty look it's real

291
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,849
nice of Jo Ann doll for Judy a

292
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,260
peppermint stick but it's odd that he

293
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,820
would reach out his right hand then

294
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,260
magically have the peppermint sticks in

295
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,789
his left hand when the shot changes to

296
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,349
over Judy's shoulder moody steals the

297
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,580
dead man's view shot complete with

298
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,140
Michael Madsen and uma thurman's body

299
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,790
double from Kill Bill and he's gonna

300
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,100
have my sister with him Neve is gonna

301
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,290
have any change that this guy learn

302
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,670
about who captured his sister and when

303
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,080
they were gonna come through here during

304
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,940
the next four hours Jodie and the boys

305
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,350
took the bodies down the well

306
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,910
unnecessary narration is more

307
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,770
unnecessary than usual Jodie is the only

308
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,090
one who lies even though they're all

309
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,800
relatively well known gangsters which we

310
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,300
find out later and with the passengers

311
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,470
in the now arriving stagecoach

312
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,270
propensity for recognizing people it

313
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,710
sure is super fucking lazy that they

314
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,700
don't know who these guys are

315
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,230
tarantino abandons its chapter numbering

316
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,820
scheme i guess he does this to keep

317
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,110
people from leaving the theatre because

318
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,340
they aren't sure how many more chapters

319
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,670
they can endure ah you fell in the

320
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,410
basement wait a minute why didn't Joe D

321
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,910
use his advantage to shoot Chris through

322
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,790
the floorboards to his big bad cat were

323
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,610
fifty thousand dollars and every member

324
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,010
of his gang were released in yeah you

325
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,420
mean to tell me that this professional

326
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,620
bounty hunter guy didn't recognize

327
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,390
anybody from the infamous gang until

328
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,980
Daisy brought up a real last name and

329
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,720
John didn't either surely they'd seen

330
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,860
drawings of some of these people before

331
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,660
any good gun slinging frontiersmen

332
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,830
should know that if someone already has

333
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,540
the draw on you it's probably not the

334
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,740
best idea to jump up and fling your

335
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,030
chair and try and shoot them they will

336
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,110
definitely shoot you first

337
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,589
when the hangman catches you yeah hey

338
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,930

339
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,220
used to get all sappy and decide to

340
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,839
honor John Ruth can't we just shoot her

341
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,380
and be done with it ah these two

342
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,790

343
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,350
to lift Daisy even after extreme blood

344
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,440
loss so the next person to come across

345

349
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,870

423
