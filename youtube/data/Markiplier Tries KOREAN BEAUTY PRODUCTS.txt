I'm not gonna bother with all these

79
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,089

80
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:12,749
of it that's what you wanted right I

81
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,639
feel a natural inclination to push my

82
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,800
lips out farther this is why super

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,559
Shepard had the accent he did because I

84

85
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:26,259
lip acting in there so I also have my

86
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,169

able to talk for a while so I'm going to

93
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,439
have subtitled all of my actual thoughts

94
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:16,869
afterwards okay it's no blank it's the

95
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,239
field a pristine meadow of untouched

96
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,529
white no animals calm no birds cry only

97
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,479
the steady rustling of wind through dead

98
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,789
trees accented by the impact of his axe

99
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,369
a crack like thunder rings out as the

100
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:32,379
ancient pine finally succumbs to his

101
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,110
murderous assault the old giant crashes

102
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,489
into the ground Jamie anyway now it's

103
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,660
time to move

104
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:51,490

106
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,140
tits breast mask I've got this because I

107
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,510
want my boobs to be as subtle as

108
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,260
possible

109
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,240
I should have shaved but I didn't so

110
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,630
it's like an obstacle course for the

111
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:52,480
mask which seems right stick anyway I

112
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
don't know why specifically you want

113
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,370
your boobs to be moisturized and no

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,300
other part of you but uh but I feel a

115
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:11,730
cool tingling sensation so that's nice

116
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,180
so this also comes with a associated

117
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,670
building methods see these aren't wet

118
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,650
these aren't wet they're dry

119
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,810
why is this gonna like menthol now see

120
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,220
I'm getting out of frame here for a

121
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,550
second I have to bellybuttons because I

122
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,050
had surgery that went in down here

123
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,320
laparoscopically

124
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,080
so I have to make a choice which belly

125
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,440
button I want I'm gonna go for big Bongo

126
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,220
I'm happy

127
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,020
can this be the Sunday law will be

128
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,080
instantly Devon oh no my face is livid

129
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,990
alright so those are tingly man if only

130
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,640
buddha had this in his time

131
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,650
alright so there's this other thing it's

132
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,410
like a it's like a lifting mask so when

133
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,650
your chin gets real droopy i guess cuz

134
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,570
the bone has a tendency to wander over

135
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,030
time so you want to make sure that chin

136
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,520
stays in place where it belongs so you

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,070
have these masks that kind of stretch

138
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,890
underneath your chin to give you a

139
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,750
lifting sensation or something like that

140
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,030
does this like hook over my ears or what

141
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,030
okay my head's huge so i don't know how

142
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,150
well they're gonna work but no pain no

143
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:41,650

144
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,870

145
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,240

172
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,200

174
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,730
take this off now my chin feels properly

175
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,260
lived in I don't know what effect this

176
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,340
is supposed to be it doesn't even feel

177
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,240
like it's tight

178
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,100
look none of these products feel like

179
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,480
they're doing anything I like it when

180
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,630
something hits my skin that it burns it

181
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,440
feels like it's melting and that way

182
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,930
it works it's like mouthwash you only

183
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,330
know what it working when it hurts

184
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,310
they say beauty is pain but this is easy

185
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,830
I've got a moisture foot pack but for

186
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,150
the sake of all the foot fetish shoes

187
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,890
out there I'm not going to do that

188
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,570
everybody knows the hands are the foots

189
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,350
of the hands so this is a foot mask but

190
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,050
to thwart all the foot fetish assists

191
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,000
I miss visit diaper this looks like a

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,740
diaper this is a diaper

193
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,790
nothing convinces me this is not a

194
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,340
diaper everything about this is

195
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:58,790
screaming diaper I hit the wet spot

196
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:06,850
[Music]

197
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,380
putting your hand inside a dead animal

198
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,710
this is a moist goopy dead animal that's

199
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,310
cold it's rum reasons implicating me in

200
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,320
a lot of sticking my hand in dead

201
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,780
animals but okay I've never stuck my

202
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,730
hand in a dead animal this is the first

203
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,140
thing that jumped into mind it's like

204
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,020
sticking your hand in a used diaper

205
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,340
that's been left out sitting for a while

206
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,770
so it got cold and I don't know if I'd

207
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,660
rather have a warm diaper or a cold

208
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,060
diaper right now I'd want to try a warm

209
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,070
diaper just to get some kind of

210
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,290
difference so I can compare I don't know

211
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,600
how it could be better with your feet

212
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,830
hey I think the internet would kill me

213
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:49,960
if I didn't about this mask

214
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,950
all right Shrek try the mystery Shrek

215
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,770
oh yeah if both doesn't feel any

216
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,870
different than the other masks and it

217
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,150
feels completely different from the

218
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,370
other masks but I think that's just a

219
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:17,960
sense of power have we ever introduced

220
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,560
Henri

221
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,820

230
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,820
[Music]

231
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:24,880
or beautiful Henry do you wanna mess wow

232
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,660
so pretty so unbelievable so so pretty

233
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:51,139
all right good girl thank you sure could

234
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,420
be so goddamn cute too pretty that's too

235
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,360
precious all right so there's only one

236
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,520
thing left to try so this is a Zig

237
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,900
bubble clay mask when it reacts with air

238
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,890
it's all bubbly okay so this is the

239
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,250
bubble mask so when you put this on your

240
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,159
face it starts to bubble up and since I

241
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,600
can't see anything I can only go by

242
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,549
sensation but I've got this weird

243
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,130
tingling tickling sensation going all

244
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,549
across my nose so with that being said I

245
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:34,820
guess I can rate my favorite masks I

246
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,309
definitely like the breast mask I'm not

247
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,630
just saying that because I like boobs

248
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,159
I'm saying that because it wasn't

249
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,040
sopping wet when I first put it on it

250
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,110
had a nice menthol to it so I knew it

251
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,309
was working because I could feel it

252
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:48,320
tingle on my titties and then I actually

253
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,059
had the belly mask on and I could really

254
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,890
smell the menthol and that worked out

255
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,850
well so I like that this lifting thing I

256
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,790
have no idea how that's even supposed to

257
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,650
how they even think that supposed to

258
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,330
work I don't know it's its slogan is my

259
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,280
special secret of jaw line management

260
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,580
and I didn't know how much jaw line

261
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,900
management I needed in my day-to-day

262
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,590
life but now I have some as opposed to

263
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,790
zero so I suppose that's good

264
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,480
these are horrible BTS Dreamboats

265
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,290

266
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,960

271
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,790
covered in many different fluids now and

272
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,830
then I will cherish these till the end

273
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,460
of my days

274
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,230
I'll hang them up above my bed and I

275
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,780
will enjoy them in my privacy of my own

276
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,790

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,780
reuse them why can't you reuse these put

281

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
by the FDA who's made Korea they don't

287
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
even have FDA who knows what the worst

288

290

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,100
mom why the hell I bought all these the

292
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,140
take away is the price of beauty is high

293
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,300
and the price of beauty is higher if you

294
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,710
buy a hundred and twenty dollars worth

295
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,390
