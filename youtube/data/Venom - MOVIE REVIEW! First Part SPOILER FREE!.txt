1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,550
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,140
YouTube boogie2988 come on if you live

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,700
let's get into the power of the Internet

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,259
I'm with you once again with my good

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,929
friend the grave ghoul social media

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,269
links down below we just got back from

7
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,780
that's right

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,000
venom wearing my awesome loot crate's

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,350
shirt and by the way big thingy to the

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,690
three fans who has to take pictures with

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,890
me after the show was really really

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,439
great so I want to do a little review

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,730
here and if you guys don't know the

14
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,189
structure for more reviews I always like

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,279
to do a non spoilery section beforehand

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,599
that way if you don't know whether or

17
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,500
not you want to see the movie you'll

18
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,850
know whether or not to see the movie I

19
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,739
like I never really give like a score

20
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,450
because I don't believe in scoring

21
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,610
something like I can't tell you it's

22
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,559
just 78 what is what does that mean I

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,520
don't know what that means but here's

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
what I will do I'll tell you whether or

25
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,070
not this is a movie you should see in

26
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,180
theaters whether it's not a movie you

27
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,710
should wait to see at home and whether

28
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,800
or not you should skip it all together

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,170
that said let's give to the non spoiler

30
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,550
stuff overall impressions what do you

31
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,680
think of venom as a movie I thought it

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,039
was great

33
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,420
I have to say somewhere between okay did

34
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,570
very good I went into this with a rotten

35
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,080
tomato score of 30 or 28% have you seen

36
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,580
these reviews 91% of people wanting to

37
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,189
watch this movie so obviously this is

38
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,509
one of those cases where the critics and

39
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,610
the fans aren't going to line up I went

40
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,380
into this movie with extreme

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,790
reservations not just because of the

42
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,490
rotten tomato score but because I'm an

43
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,100
old-school spider-man fan venom belongs

44
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,579
in in the spider universe taking him out

45
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,229
of that and making him his own thing is

46
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,210
difficult but as a comic book fan I'm

47
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,829
used to retconning I'm used to

48
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,840
alternative universes this is just an

49
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,570
alternative universe story telling and I

50
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,500
know you said you're a bit of a

51
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,640
spider-man fan too and you're absolutely

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,530
she knows way more about the symbiotes

53
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,030
than I did because as we're watching the

54
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,560
movie she's leaning over just like oh my

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
god that's riot oh my god that's you

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,799
know all these different stuff that I

57
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,070
didn't know about the symbiote so that

58
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,670
was really educational um I would say

59
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,290
that when it comes to the casting what

60
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,630
did you think of Tom Hardy as as Eddie

61
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,640
Brock I wouldn't have pictured it before

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,380
but whenever I finally saw it I actually

63
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,810
really enjoyed it and I will say that

64
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,739
that he absolutely makes this movie all

65
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,900
of the scenes with with Eddie Brock and

66
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,470
all they had

67
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,840
things are really good I will say that

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
when it comes to the structure of the

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,390
movie I feel that it could have

70
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,120
definitely used some work I don't know

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,350
how you feel about this but the first

72
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,990
third right up until venom is introduced

73
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,630
is kind of slow and it was a very slow

74
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,790
start right I just didn't I didn't feel

75
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,890
I don't really feel anything for the

76
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,120
characters I kind of like dozed off

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
you're not really engaged but you know

78
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,480
that venom is going to calm it that

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,370
that's what the whole movies about so it

80
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,780
keeps you kind of tuned but still and

81
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,550
then I think once venom hits the screen

82
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,610
everything picks up and I don't know

83
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,020
what's wrong with the first section of

84
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,910
the movie as much as it is that there's

85
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,240
um just pacing issues and there's not

86
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,860
really much of anything of interest

87
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,510
going on there's a bit of a love story

88
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,580
but it changes very quickly there's a

89
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,080
little bit of building up of who Eddie

90
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,340
Brock is and what his career is about

91
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,110
there's a little bit of selling up the

92
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,430
the antagonist of the film but it all

93
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,380
could have been done so much better once

94
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,610
the venom hits the screen though it's

95
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,230
pretty much a thrill ride um now when it

96
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,050
comes to the CGI and graphics wow I just

97
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,060
I mean I'm an old man so I don't I

98
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,730
normally have a problem seeing like CGI

99
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,010
as the movie but venom looked just

100
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,269
straight-up looked incredible I couldn't

101
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,350
I was so surprised

102
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,650
um the character just looks so better so

103
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,690
much better than I expected it to I will

104
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,280
say when it comes to the trailers I

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,900
don't like the trailers are fairly

106
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,459
misleading as to what this movie is

107
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,860
going to be absolutely um because the

108
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,750
trailers just come across as this hokey

109
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,790
Lake of the original trailer venom looks

110
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,590
very different than he does in the final

111
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,890
film the eyes changed so much right and

112
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,600
then the the whole if you've seen the

113
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,920
trailers no spoiler said but if you've

114
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,570
seen their trailers there's a scene that

115
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,310
takes place in a convenience store and

116
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,260
that makes the movie feel like it's

117
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,060
going to be just kind of hokey and goofy

118
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,940
and like pixels the you know like one of

119
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,400
these awful Sony films it definitely

120
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,900
wasn't that I feel like the people who

121
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
wrote the script and who made this movie

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,610
have a love affair with venom I don't

123
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,450
think it was fully realized though so

124
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,370
that said you should you see this movie

125
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,519
in the theaters would the action is good

126
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,720
I had trouble following the action to

127
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,770
you I mean what do you think of the

128
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,510
action scenes overall I thought they

129
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,520
were incredible honestly like some of

130
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,240
the the Cindy

131
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,210
stuff is very very good I think

132
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,710
sometimes I'm an old man once again all

133
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,150
this quick edit stuff is very difficult

134
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,740
for me to follow I grew up on Bruce Lee

135
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,780
and virtually like zero cutscenes right

136
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,639
one of my favorite scenes in the Marvel

137
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,410
Universe all together is the Daredevils

138
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,479
episode - scene where it's like the long

139
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,770
fight in the hallway you seen the

140
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,690
daredevil Netflix right like the huge

141
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,789
long fight in the hallway this is very

142
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,190
Cudi and choppy in places still a lot of

143
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,669
fun deep doo-doo you need to see it in

144
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,960
theater do you think you can wait til

145
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,060
Gotama personally I enjoyed it in

146
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,530
theaters but I think it could have been

147
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,389
something that could have waited right

148
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,490
and that's the thing there's no big

149
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,729
spoiler here um even if you get told

150
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,009
exactly what happens in this movie it's

151
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,419
really not gonna change anything it's

152
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,849
not like you know it's not like Red Bud

153
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,770
it's not like a rose but it's not like

154
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,910
there's nothing that's going to ruin

155
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,139
this movie so you don't have to rush up

156
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,759
and see it opening weekend I do think

157
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,770
staying at home is a very very good

158
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,050
option if you're a Marvel fan and you're

159
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,970
not offended by the fact that spider-man

160
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,319
has nothing to do this if you're not

161
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,360
offended by the fact that this is an

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,030
alternative universe retelling which I

163
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,740
kind of was I still really enjoyed the

164
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,280
movie um so breaking into the actual

165

166
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:43,259
the post-credits scene this is for

167
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,820
there's absolute spoiler sections as

168
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,699

173
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,460

174
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,560
so much alright so we'll save we'll save

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,150
the the the trailer bed so overall in

176
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,590
the movie you've got several symbiotes

177
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,440
landing on earth you have like this um

178
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,969
Lex Luthor style character who's

179
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,680
interested in getting humans off of the

180
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,810
planet because the planet is dying he

181
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,729
finds the symbiotes the symbiotes come

182
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,289
back to earth and then the symbiotes

183
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,800
hatch a plan to go out to you know go

184
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,460
out into space

185
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,169
steal his rocket bring the symbiotes

186
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,820
back and I guess eat our planet yeah and

187
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,590
then do whatever they're gonna do to it

188
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,650
um I mean it's an okay plot I enjoy it

189
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,690
but I mean whenever I realize that they

190
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,460
were bringing back more than just venom

191
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,110
I was on the edge of my seat because I

192
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,789
mean if you if you've read like the

193
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,919
original comics and you know about like

194
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,710
the Clint are like

195
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,290
um I was that's what I was expecting

196
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,940
there was a I mean I guess really did

197
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,790
the the whole spoiler thing a time where

198
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,550
he locks one of these doctors in the

199
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,560
room with a symbiote and I was expecting

200
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,110
it to be screamed and like the whole

201
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,410
time there was like a little girl

202
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,840
it was sorry yeah you're right I that

203
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,000
that one was right that was riot yeah

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,290
but a symbiote had inhabited and it just

205
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,550
was the only one that they couldn't find

206
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,710
at the beginning right and I kept

207
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,010
expecting it to be venom and the finally

208
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,630
came a time where where venom inhabits I

209
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,570
Brock and then you realize oh shit if

210
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,070
that that's Samia that's on the loose

211
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,740
isn't isn't venom it's gotta be somebody

212
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,480
who is it and it's all at that point it

213
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,220
only having females so you were thinking

214
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,110
scream because she tends to haven't

215
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,850
females I guess I shouldn't say he or

216
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,260
she because I guess the symbols have no

217
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,950
sex right

218
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,690
I mean end up being riot and I guess

219
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,280
there were several other on the play

220
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
would probably unnamed one since a lot

221
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,340
of them died off in the process there

222
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,840
was going to be a sequel right first

223
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,780
office right and that they I mean

224
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,130
heavily I hope it does well enough for a

225
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,810
sequel I have to I have to go right into

226
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,190
that post credit scene I don't care

227
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,350
Woody Harrelson is carnage I don't know

228
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,430
what to make of that what do you hear

229
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,230
else in said old man he's like it is 50s

230
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,990
now but but habit I always remember

231
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,550
carnage me being a young serial killer

232
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,960
it was just terrifying because he was a

233
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,750
serial killer he was it was gruesome and

234
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,550
if you remember how carnage looks he's

235
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,450
like fucking 9 feet tall and crazy ass

236
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,190
teeth so right right right that was

237
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,530
terrifying to know that I mean venom

238
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,520
inhabits Eddie Brock reporter right you

239
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,890
mean and because because Eddie Brock is

240
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,050
in a relatively good person especially

241
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,330
in this movie then then internist learns

242
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,280
to love us a little bit which I think

243
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,450
it's one of my biggest taking fourth

244
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,170
don't let me forget the talk but at the

245
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,940
end it just it shows

246
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,040
Eddie Brock talking to like a prison

247
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,110
guard and he's like walking into a cell

248
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,540
and they refer to the prisoners red and

249
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,980
that's when you're like oh shit like if

250
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,560
if that was riot earlier this has got to

251
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,210
be car if you see the big shock of red

252
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,890
hair and then it turns around as Woody

253
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,050
Harrelson and I can

254
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:00,050
get over I love what so that's what was

255
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,660
he what was he writing in blood I was

256
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,670
just so excited right because I was

257
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,990
about to leave the theater you know

258
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,029
never like without the post-credits all

259
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,620
right very especially any Marvel thing

260
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:18,920
and the worst part of this movie easily

261
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,630
to me and I think it's a sticking point

262
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,279
out hopefully for most people who watch

263
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,050
I she agreed I think most of my friends

264
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,079
agreed venom goes from I love to eat

265
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,959
faces and I love to eat people to seeing

266
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,540
the sky light at some point and saying

267
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,160
this planet is beautiful it's sad we

268
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,990
have to destroy it and then decides he

269
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,209
doesn't want to destroy it now I felt

270
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,709
there was no real build-up for it but if

271
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,019
you look the pieces are there his

272
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,430
biggest he's the biggest argument was

273
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,620
that he was in loser on his planet like

274
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,140
Eddie and he kind of liked being a

275
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,000
superhero or super creature on this

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,649
planet I didn't pick up on that until

277
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,480
she pointed it out but right it's twice

278
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,490
his size four times as powerful can do

279
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,470
so much more

280
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,180
at first I feel like Venom's intentions

281
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,589
were very selfish I mean if you know any

282
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:03,470
of them like venom is a villain but then

283
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,200
you kind of see that Eddie needs venom

284
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,420
as much as venom needs Eddie there comes

285
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,250
a time or riot and just rips him

286
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,600
straight out of Eddie and he's about to

287
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,870
eat him and Eddie like reaches and he's

288
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:21,140
like what get back in me you know but he

289
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,029
like saves him and then there's a time

290
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,100
where Eddie brought gets fucking impaled

291
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,640
by riot and left to die and here comes

292
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,079
venomous little symbiote crawling back

293
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,829
to to you know make things right how did

294
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:36,500
it set with you when he's diving off of

295
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,140
the spaceship and then venom sacrifices

296
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,899
himself to save my blog I didn't I was

297
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:42,949
like obviously it's a comic book

298
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,029
obviously they want to set it up for

299
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,440
sequels so I didn't know they were gonna

300
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,820
end the movie with you wondering whether

301
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,709
or not he was still alive or whether or

302
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:49,730
not they would show that you're still

303
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,329
alive

304
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,620
they end up showing you still alive I

305
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,970
think the ending that movies probably

306
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,070
the best part what about the kiss that

307
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,980
was the most romantic kiss of all time

308
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,910
pretend there's a clip of it right now

309
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,290
because they're in smaller sections so

310
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,839
you should see this movie but the venom

311
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,070
ends up and having

312
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,780
Annie is her name of leave and then she

313
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,330
ends up going from a dog to any I wish

314
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,770
they had shown that there's so much in

315
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,480
this movie that I wish they had shown I

316
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
said a lot of the reviewers said that

317
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,510
this felt like a turd in the wind they

318
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,770
felt like it felt like an armless

319
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,440
legless thing to quote the movie I kind

320
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,390
of see that criticism because I really

321
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,690
it didn't have the flow of the recent

322
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,130
Thor movies doesn't have the flow it

323
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,390
doesn't the flow of spider-man

324
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,590
homecoming which i think is probably the

325
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,840
most important thing to compare it to

326
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,840
but I feel like there's a lot of really

327
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,220
good pieces there and I want there to be

328
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,300
a sequel because I think they're really

329
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,740
picking up I think Eddie Brock is an

330
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,210
incredible character I think it was

331
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,680
played exceptionally well I like the

332
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,810
love story between him and man Annie I

333
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,310
love the fact that venom is in love with

334
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,230
Annie too so that's really smart the

335
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,550
Stan Lee cameo What did he say

336
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,240
What did he say there was um don't don't

337
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,780
don't give up on her either of you oh

338
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,450
right so Stanley obviously God in this

339
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,300
universe comes a moment where I like

340
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,720
rescues right and he's like talking to

341
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
himself while talking to venom he's like

342
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,390
oh my god like don't eat or don't eat or

343
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,010
like like this is dangerous like you

344
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,110
shouldn't have me in the car and Venom's

345
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,090
like ooh I like her with her right

346
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,940
mostly he just like can I eat him and I

347
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,460
I feel like I feel like since Venom's

348
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,950
been inside of her he knows how much she

349
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,200
loves him so there's like right like so

350
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,150
I wish they talked about that a little

351
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,510
bit

352
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,270
I wish they'd shown that but again I

353
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,390
think it all comes down to the team that

354
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,490
was handed this script did a great job I

355
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,830
think the script had really good parts I

356
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,050
think it just has some big holes in it

357
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,850
like I wish it ran 20 minutes longer to

358
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,380
fill in those holes I really wish that

359
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,630
we showed not just venom knowing that

360
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,010
he's like a superhero on this planet

361
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,870
right but enjoying the food enjoying the

362
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,610
city and enjoying Patty's life enjoying

363
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,610
something that he would write right give

364
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,840
me that motivation because I think the

365
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,490
big difference between the Sony Pictures

366
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,100
that deal with Marvel and the Marvel

367
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,110
movies that deal with Marvel I always

368
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,810
feel so connected to the characters

369
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,060
guardians of the galaxy even Thanos and

370
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,570
he not so much Ultron but you know I

371
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,100
mean I hope the entire Avengers said

372
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,140
Black Panther for what like it or love

373
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,750
it I even felt you know I felt the power

374
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,480
between the the

375
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,750
villain and and the main character right

376
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,519
it's hard to get emotionally connected

377
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,649
to any of the sony pictures the amazing

378
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,010
spider-man couldn't feel it you know I

379
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,750
write I definitely couldn't feel that

380
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,519
emotional connection here and I really

381
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,750
wish that's the thing that's missing

382
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,839
from this movie I think is heart it's a

383
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,790
great action flick it's a lot of fun to

384
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,360
watch the the the it's the best venom

385
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
movie we'll get probably for a really

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,449
long time as long as some who owns the

387
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,360
property and you have to accept the fact

388
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,910
that it's in an alternative universe but

389
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,680
if you're willing to accept that it's a

390
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,630
really fun movie is it the venom movie

391
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,089
we always wanted what about you is it

392
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:03,760
the venom movie you always wanted right

393
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,350
you know it's a nice little throwaway

394
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,149
movie maybe one day we'll get vitam

395
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,260
venom vs. spider-man

396
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,570
I mean Sony does still technically own

397
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,550
spider-man they just loaned it to Disney

398
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,980
maybe venom will show up in the Marvel

399
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,750
Cinematic Universe and it's more true

400
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,630
form but this is good enough for now I

401
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,829
think you definitely should probably

402
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:23,230
watch it at least at home and honestly

403
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,149
the surround sound was good enough to

404
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,800
where I should maybe should have seen in

405
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,170
IMAX but I am glad I saw it very glad

406
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,819
you saw it definitely and it's our first

407
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,019
Marvel movie together it's kind of fun

408
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,269
hanging out and watching that Sammy was

409
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:35,920
miserable while we were gone I got to

410
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,149
say again thanks to the fans who came

411
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,069
