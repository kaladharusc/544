00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,860
[Detective Abe alone in his office]

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,820
[Abe's thought monologue] &quot;I've never been much for smoking&quot;

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,580
&quot;but taking a bullet to the chest will make you a lot less worried&quot;

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,460
&quot;about the slow deaths of the world.&quot;

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,780
&quot;Long story short: I took a job I shouldn't have.&quot;

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,620
&quot;They say the pretty ones will always get you killed,&quot;

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,540
&quot;but he was so damn handsome, I just couldn't resist.&quot;

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,620
&quot;I was a frog in a slow pot of boiling water, or the first clown to get into the clown car.&quot;

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,060
&quot;You don't know to get out until it's too late.&quot;

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,500
&quot;One thing led to another and I found myself slow dancing with a devil in the moonlight.&quot;

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,760
&quot;Except instead of leaving room for Jesus, he left room for a 357 Magnum.&quot;

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,880
&quot;I won't bore you with the details.&quot;

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,320
&quot;So I'll cut right to the quick: a lot of people died because of this man.&quot;

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,940
*clink*

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,700
&quot;Mhrr..&quot;

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,820
&quot;William J...&quot;

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,240
&quot;Dammit. Come on!&quot;
*clink*

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,260
&quot;William J. Barnum a.k.a. The Colonel.&quot;

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,240
&quot;Just like the clown in my bar mitzvah, I knew he was trouble from the moment I laid eyes on him.&quot;

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,780
&quot;And just like Bozo The Magnificent, a lot of people died when he walked into my life.&quot;

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,920
*Echos of the Bozo laughing*

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,080
I've been chasing him down ever since. We were like two naked men running on the same treadmill.&quot;

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,460
&quot;Uncomfortably close but always just a step behind.&quot;

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,480
&quot;But no one can run forever.&quot;
*taps of chalk on blackboard*

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,500
&quot;Especially not with 200 pounds of sweaty detective breathing down your neck.&quot;

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,220
&quot;It hasn't been easy though.&quot;

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,260
&quot;I can't count how many countries I've cornered him in.&quot;

29
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,260
&quot;Couldn't tell you how many times I've had him in my big, strong hands&quot;
*detective grunting on stuck filecase*

30
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,580
&quot;Every time I think I've got him for good, he somehow manages to slip away.&quot;

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,060
&quot;But he's running out of holes to hide in.&quot;

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,080
&quot;I mean that literally, metaphorically, and euphemistically.&quot;

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,960
&quot;It doesn't matter how crafty you think you are...&quot;

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,860
Abe (on phone): Mmm.. Mhm..*laughs*
&quot;If you've been on the run for years and years...&quot;

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,980
Alright, perfect! ..Thanks.
&quot;Eventually...&quot;

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,920
&quot;...you're gonna make a mistake.&quot;

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,620
&quot;Word of advice: if you're running away from your problems, never become too attached to anything.&quot;

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
&quot;Family, lovers,..&quot;

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,220
&quot;..briefcases on top of your car...&quot;

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,800
*Thumps of briefcase*

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,640
&quot;Some things are best left behind.&quot;

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,480
&quot;The Colonel's a slippery one. Shedding names as easily as a snake sheds a few pounds before bikini season.&quot;

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,280
&quot;He's gone through pseudonym after pseudonym trying to cover his tracks.&quot;

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,460
&quot;But he always manages to fall back into the same familiar roles...&quot;

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,600
&quot;Drinking, fighting,...&quot;

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,660
&quot;...flirting,...&quot;

47
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
&quot;...dancing.&quot;

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,820
*jazz music begins to fade for faster disco music*

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:21,700
*disco music*

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,620
&quot;The Colonel was always one for the eccentrics, but his latest persona takes the entire cake shop.&quot;

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,900
&quot;Wilford.&quot;

*disco music fading slightly*

*Screams fading as people get out*

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,480
*upbeat disco music still playing*

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,180
Abe: Get your ass down here.

61
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,760
Don't move, asshole!

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,320
Show me your hands!

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,440
Not like that. Put 'em down!

64
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
*gunshot*

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,700

67
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,560
Abe: Get down on the ground. Get down on the ground right now!

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,540
Wilford: Oo-oh, why'd the music stop?

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,220
Abe: You're not getting away from me this time asshole. I said get your ass down on the ground.

70
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,400
Wilford: Do I know you, friend?

71
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Abe: I said GET DOWN ON--!

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
What?... How do you not--?

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,900
Stop playing games. Get your ass down on the ground before I blow you right here, RIGHT NOW!

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,000
...away.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Wilford: Dave? Daaaave! Dave?

76
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,940
Dave!

77
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,020
Greg. Steve?

78
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,780
Bill? Dave! I knew I recognized you. How are you? How's the wife?

79
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,820
Abe: I don't have a wife. STOP stalling!

80
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,560
You're under arrest for the murder of way too many people to even count!

81
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,060
Wilford:  Well, that's just ridiculous! I would never kill anybody.

82
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,440
Abe: Oh, is that right?

83
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,960
Well, whatever you say, buddy.

84

*Electric charge from taser gun*

85

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,380
*clicks of a small chain*

87
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,900
*return of the soft jazz music*

88
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,140
Abe: You ran a real good race there, buddy.

89
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,280
*Abe trying to get engine started*

90
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,600
But it's the end of the road for you.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,020
The law is gonna throw every book they have at you and after that,

92
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,260
They're gonna throw you in a cell and after that,

93
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,740
they're gonna throw away the key and after that, they're gonna throw that...

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,360
cell...

95
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,640
into a lake.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,020
Abe, (inner monalogue): &quot;But not before I throw a few things at him first.&quot;

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,380
&quot;We're gonna play pin the tail on the donkey.&quot;

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,500
&quot;But he's the donkey, and the tail, is my feelings.&quot;

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,520
&quot;But I shouldn't get ahead of myself.&quot;

100
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,940
&quot;I only get one night with him to fill the hole in my heart he left behind.&quot;

101
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,380
&quot;It's finally time to get some answers.&quot;

102
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,080
Wilford (in Abe's head): &quot;Did we date at some point?&quot;

103
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,820
Abe: &quot;No! We didn't date. The hole is a metaphor for when you shot me in the --&quot;

104
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,200
Wilford: Car.

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,900
*Abe screams as a car horn sounds, tires squealing*

106
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,940
Abe (in thoughts): &quot;Holy shit that was close!&quot;

107
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,620
Wilford: &quot;We could have taken them.&quot;

108
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,820
Abe: &quot;What the hell does that have to do with-?&quot;

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,400
How did you...? How ARE YOU --?!

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,960
(Abe, in his thoughts): &quot;How many fingers am I holding up?&quot;

111
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,680
Wilford: Four..?

112
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,580
Abe: &quot;Aardvark!&quot;

113
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,320
&quot;Pumpernickel!&quot;

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Wilford: What are you doing?
Abe: &quot;Calabasas!&quot;

115
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,640
Wilford: &quot;Are you oookaaaayy?&quot;

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,660
Abe: HOW ARE YOU IN MY HEAD?!

117
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,020
Wilford: Why are you shouting?!

118
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,480
Abe: &quot;GET OUT OF MY HEAD!&quot;

119
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
Wilford: &quot;YOU'RE STILL SHOUTING!&quot;

120
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,660
*both screaming* AAAAHHHH

121
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,300
*electric charge of taser gun over their yelling*

122
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,400
Wilford: HnaAAaohh AAaAHh OoOOaH Ooahf nha-ah.. Ooah.. Yeah?

123
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,920
Abe: Enough games!

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:50,840
Your ass, is mine for the next 24 hours.

125
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,240
And I'm gonna take my sweet time...

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,760
...with that ass.

127
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,240
To get, answers out of it...

128
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
from you.

129
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,320
Wilford: W-well, I- I suppose I could stay here a while, get comfortable...*sigh*

130
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,060
Lovely place you've got here!

131
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,320
Could use a bit more color...

132
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,020
Abe: Enough!! With your bullshit!

133
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,580
Do you have any remorse?

134
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,360
Any remorse at all for the things you've done or are you too much of a coward to face your crimes?

135
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,960
Wilford: Well, there's no need for name-calling!

136
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,260
Abe: Name-calling, huh? *chuckle*

137
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,080
Abe: Name-calling, huh? *chuckle*

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,660
Abe: And, uh, what name, would you prefer, huh?

139
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,480
*clank*

140

*clank*clonk*

142
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,660
Is it...

143
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,280
William J. Butterfield?

144
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,260
Wilford (chuckling): Well- well now, that's a name I- oowww

145
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,000
Abe: Wilson Jackson Bartholomew III?

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Wilford: Well now I actually married into thaaa-at.. name...

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,580
Abe: Wingleheimer!

148
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,580
(softer) Wait, just... Wingleheimer?

149
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,120
Wilford: Alright, I may have been having a little bit of fun with that one- OW.

150
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,860
Abe: NAME, AFTER NAME, AFTER name after name!

151
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,400
Just, so you can distance yourself from the real name you should be called.

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,120
(softly) Murderer.

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,500
*Wilford memories start flushing in*

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,880
Wilford: (softly) Abe?

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,540
Abe! Abe, it's been years!

156
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,640
How are you? How are you doing? How's the family?

157
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,320
Abe: Oh, I'm doing just peachy, Buddy!

158
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,220
'cause I've been waiting a long, long time for this day to come,

159
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,160
so we could sit down, have a chat.

160
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,760
Catch up; good and proper.

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,660
Wilford: Wow...

162
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,220
There we all are!

163
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,620
Abe: How the hell did you do that?!

164
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,320
Wilford: We look so young!

165
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,540
Abe: You better get your ass BACK in that chair!

166
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,040
Also, how did you get your ass out of that chair?

167
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,180
You're gonna tell me, you're gonna tell me, how you got your ass out of that chair

168
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,660
so I can figure out a way to get it back IN that chair.

169
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,280
Wilford: Oh there's Celine... my heart still beats for her to this day!

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,780
But if she saw me she'd probably carve mine out! *laughs*

171
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,680
Abe: What?

172
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,880
Wilford: How did you find all this?

173
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,540
Abe: I've-I've-I've... I've always had them! I've been collecting them.

174
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,380
Every single scrap of evidence this whole time so that one day,

175
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,880
*cocks gun*

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,520
I can bring you down.

177
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,980
Wilford: (softly) That's so sweet.

178
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,680
Abe: It's not sweet, that's sickening!

179
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,980
Wilford: Sickeningly sweeeet!

180
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,420
Abe: That's not what I meant!

181
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,260
Wilford: Look I am terribly, terribly, sorry that I didn't remember you.

182
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,700
Memories start to get jumbled after a while.

183
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,020
Sometimes I, forget even the simplest of things...

184
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,880
Abe: Oh, trust me. You'll have plenty of time to think about all the horrible things

185
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,780
you've done once they throw you in a cage, then throw away the key, and then throw that-

186
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,640
HOW THE HELL YOU KEEP DOING THAT?!

187
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,020
Wilford: Things get jumbled so easily! The when, the where, the why, the how of it all - and who can keep track of it?

188
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,460
I wonder what he's up to, have you seen him?

189
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,720
(softly) ...maybe I should stop by.

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,700
Abe: You seriously need to get back in the chair.

191
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,420
I- I- I- I- I've got more rope. Maybe that'll work.

192
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,540
Wilford: Eh, worth a shot.

193
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,680
Oh!

194
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,080
The train! Oh, I remember the train! How long were we stuck in the snow for?

195
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,260
Abe: What?

196
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,520
Wilford: Oh, you don't remember?

197
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,620
Ah, that's okay. Probably hasn't happened yet,

198
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,900
ohhh, but some of your finest work, I have to say.

199
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,060
A little spoiler alert for later to make it easier on you.

200
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,740
We all did it. *chuckles*

201
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,080
Abe: I don't underST-Aa --!

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,580
*gunshot*

203
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,860
Wilford: Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.

204
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,509
*kisses the barrel* Not now.

205
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:37,640
The grown-ups are talking.

206
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,380
Save that for later.

207
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,140
Abe: (quietly) What the hell's going on?

208
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,460
Wilford: Huh?

209
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:49,760
I don't really know. Honestly, I- I- I don't understand anything anymore... but I do remember you.

210
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,400
And I remembered that there's something I've been meaning to give you

211
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
after ALL - these - years!

212
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,120
*Suspense music builds up*

213
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,920
*squeaky hug*

214
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,700
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,060
Abe: GET OFF o- MmM...eee..

216
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,100
Wilford: If there's one thing I've learned after all these years it's that nothing heals like a good apology!

217
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,120
Abe: I don't... understand anything anymore...

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,440
Wilford: Exactly!

219
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,680
None of this makes any sense! That's the beauty of it!

220
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,980
Abe: Beauty...?

221
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,560
What about any of this, is beautiful to you?!

222
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,860
What kind of sick, twisted, SON OF A BITCH,

223
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,240
THINKS ANY OF THIS, IS BEAUTIFUL?!

224
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,660
Wilford: Now what did we say about name-calling?

225
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,940
Abe: YOOOUU KILLED PEOPLE!

226
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,100
SO MANY PEOPLE!

227
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,640
(verge of tears) You killed my friends! You killed my partner!

228
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,080
You shot... ME!

229
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,160
Wilford: Now, it SEEMS to me like you're trying to paint me as the bad guy.

230
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,760
Abe: (screaming) YOU ARE THE BAD GUY!

231
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,400
Wilford: (calmly) Okay, whoa!

232
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,020
Hey, whoa, time out. Time out. Time out.

233
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,580
Shhh... Uh, woah, hey! Hoo-hah hee-hey. Time out!

234
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,720
I get it, you've been hunting me...

235
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,340
For years, and years, and years. You've been chasing me, all around the world.

236
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,740
Uh... from bedrooms, to bathrooms, to ballrooms.

237
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,060
You've been chasing me and you've been doing a real bang-up job of it,

238
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,960
But, an- and forgive me, if this sounds ins- ULting in any way,

239
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,260
What would you say, our- Uh, o- our closest encounter was, before this VERY moment right here?

240
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,080
Abe: When was our closest encounter?

241
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,860
Wilford: Yuh-yeah.

242
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,880
Abe: Before this very moment?

243
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,340
Wilford: Yes.

244
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,420
Abe: That's easy.

245
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,180
It was when we...

246
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,560
When...

247
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,060
We, uh...

248
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,240
You...

249
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,020
Ye-Yeah ah, it was when you, um...

250
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,860
That's when you, um... *clears throat*

251
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,340
I was hunting you down, I was stalking you,

252
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,420
but you fled the country, to - uh...

253
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,160
Um...

254
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,960
All right, all right, yeah ye- ye- yeah, you were, you were off the radar for three years,

255
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,300
BUT! I got a hot tip that you had shacked up in...

256
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,960
Uh... in, um - ah...

257
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,580
You shacked up with...

258
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,600
In, uh... uh... with the...

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,340
Wilford: Three years... uh, what year was that, exactly?

260
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,160
Abe: What, what year?

261
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,080
Wilford (softly): Yes.

262
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,280
Abe: Well, u-uh, it was in, uh, i- it was in, um...

263
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,060
It... was uh...

264
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,840
It was - um...

265
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,860
(softly) I...

266
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,800
I can't re-member...

267
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,120
I...

268
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,920
I've - uh...

269
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,720
*sighs*

270
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,100
I've obsessed over this case for - uh, years...

271
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,180
Every, moment of every day....

272
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,960
Spent trying to hunt you down...

273
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,020
So why can't I remember?

274
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,480
Am I crazy?

275
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,260
Wilford: No! No-no. No, no, no, no!

276
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,980
My friend, you are NOT, crazy.

277
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,600
Don't let ANYone, EVer, tell you that you're, crazy.

278
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,500
Y-you're just too focused on the minutiae of it--

279
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,240
The details, the who killed who, the who slept with who.

280
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,620
It- you're not focusing on the big, picture.

281
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,540
Abe: It's impossible, to know things that haven't happened yet.

282
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,760
Wilford: Yes, exactly!

283
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,120
Just, like it's impossible, to survive a bullet, through the heart.

284
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,660
*faint, echoing heartbeat*

285
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,080
*piano song from the final scene of Who Killed Markiplier starts playing*

286
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Abe, (inner monalogue): &quot;This was all a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from.&quot;

287
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,980
&quot;My heart was pounding Morse code in my ears, but I never learned the language.&quot;

288
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,800
&quot;My mind was like a hamster ball rolling down the freeway -&quot;

289
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,840
&quot;no matter how fast I went I couldn't keep up with the flow.&quot;

290
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,900
&quot;It was my first year of Clown College all over again and I--..&quot;

291
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,200
Wilford: No, no, nope, nope, nope, no... no.

292
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,360
No drifting off just yet.

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,960
Listen, friend.

294
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,940
It was a bit of a shock for me, too.

295
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,000
Life needed a bit of madness, but...

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,320
(softly) why should death be any different?

297
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,400
But I think the stress, is getting to you a little bit. You need to unwind.

298
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,220
You're- you're a freshly born fawn, trying to find your legs in the world that doesn't make sense.

299
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,420
So, just for tonight...

300
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,800
Let's forget about all the- th- the chasing and, the killing and, the shooty shooty bang bang, &quot;God, you're a murderer!&quot;

301
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,360
*chuckles*

302
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,720
And just for tonight...

303
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,360
Why don't we...

304
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:20,260
have a little fun?

305
00:17:20,260 --> 00:19:05,320
*Disco music plays *

306
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,000
*ding*
