2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,870
are these the only three things dolls

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,969
have been use for toys collectors items

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,040
and demonic conduits asking for a friend

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,210
also looks like this movie should give

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,039
credit to my freshman thesis dolls from

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,900
Barbies to Bratz a raggedy ANNs tail

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,150
maybe it will also get a b-minus from my

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,949
children's playthings professor all she

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,869
wanted was to be friends when we heard

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,789
this weave we felt really sorry for her

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,279
I mean we're nurses we help people I

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,660
don't believe the Hippocratic oath lends

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,130
itself to forcing you to help possessed

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,690
dolls who very well may want to kill you

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,160
also we have to sit through a basic

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,750
retread of the opening scene from the

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,610
conjuring since probably 90% of the

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,989
people that see this movie are watching

20
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,160
because they thought the doll and the

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,540
conjuring was creepy this scene is

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,789
pointless I don't know where she got hit

23
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,090
but we are beyond terrified and the

24
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,050
thought of putting it in a trunk

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,610
wrapping it up in Chains locking that

26
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,379
inside a larger trunk wrapping it in

27
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,090
Chains tying a huge rock to it and

28
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,289
dumping it in the ocean never occurred

29
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,850
to you Church has creepy horn demon

30
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,230
statue that convenient level tie into

31
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,489
the plot of this movie in case you

32
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,539
confused it with Santa Monica

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,420
Oklahoma God on their sacrifice and our

34
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,479
sacrifices touch God's heart and move

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
his hand opening shot a foreshadowing

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,350
sermon is very foreshadowing also

37
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,909
discount F Murray Abraham we are

38
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,200
introduced to our main characters being

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,270
disrespectful dicks in church also the

40
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,439
thumb wrestling your pregnant wife in

41
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,060
church also thumb wrestling voyeurism

42
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,070
the one isn't this thumb wrestling thing

43
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,780
this couple has delightful it's their

44
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,369
thing it gives them such richness and

45
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,259
character Sharon get off Pete send you

46
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:31,829
after me

47
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,630
well no we simply asked where you were

48
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,310
and then I volunteered to find you and

49
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,570
it was really stupid because you were

50
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,829
easily found in the chapel but the

51
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:38,880
screenwriter gets to check off your

52
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,290
introduction in the first 30 pages of a

53
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,970
script so he's happy children are a

54
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,740
blessing indeed they are and the mid

55
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,869
learn to talk haha banter banter white

56
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,729
people joke banter banter we shouldn't

57
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,320
talk about the baby so much in front of

58
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,310
them

59
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,530
right first off you assholes are

60
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,210
neighbors so how is it not the main

61
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,649
topic of conversation second off you

62
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,329
assholes didn't even bring up the baby

63
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,070
they were sharing but again you want to

64
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,360
give us that insight about them losing

65
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,829
their daughter so you chose the awkward

66
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,090
path to telling us that they call

67
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,390
themselves between this news report and

68
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,769
the previous few minutes of awkward

69
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,420
conversations about kids this is a lot

70
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,010
of exposition for the first six minutes

71
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,470
of a movie hard to concentrate I

72
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,700
couldn't even hear the TV over the

73
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,060
loudest sewing machine ever movie cast

74
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,560
actress Annabelle Wallis in a movie

75
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,799
called

76
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:27,600
Annabelle now she's plenty good enough

77
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,980
for this role but you've got to think

78
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,630
the producers of this movie chose her at

79
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,100
least halfway based on the name alone

80
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,840
right guys you probably shouldn't let

81
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
John kiss the baby bump so recklessly

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,930
because Sharon and Pete next door can

83
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,280
sense you guys being happy about it

84
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,110
she's something I want to give you the

85
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,519
last time you said that I ended up

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,410
pregnant John and Mia have a stand-up

87
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,630
comic exchange circa 1930s did the

88
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,830
ghosts of Bob Hope and George Burns

89
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,239
write this movie there was no way this

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,950
dude hit a giant box with a prize doll

91
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,480
in it from his pregnant wife inside the

92
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,769
house without her stumbling upon it at

93
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,120
least once you'll be a little short on

94
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,799
the rent the next few months like that

95
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,690
once our landlords find out that I spent

96
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,070
some of that rent on a rare doll to

97
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,299
complete a collection they'll be sure

98
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,590
not to evict after me a complaint

99
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,820
earlier in the day about leaving the

100
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,510
door unlocked

101
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,620
they leave their window open while they

102
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,360
sleep

103
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,980
all of this happens in Plainview and Mia

104
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,420
wakes up because she feels a disturbance

105
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,800
in the force but unfortunately this

106
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,940
murder turns the light off before she

107
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,750
can see anything

108
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,670
also Sharon insted eyes so everything in

109
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,750
the neighboring house is completely

110
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,580
silent after she screams one time also

111
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,930
also for this shot to happen these

112
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,310
couples are super okay with leaving

113
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,360
their windows uncovered at night

114
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,710
directly facing each other's bedrooms

115
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,990
also also also this jump-scare is the

116
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,250
only scary thing that happens in the

117
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,720
entire movie and it doesn't even involve

118
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,220
the creepy doll that the entire movie is

119
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,660
supposed to be about don't mind me I'm

120
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,220
just walking around being creepy I serve

121
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,780
no function at all right now there's

122
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,190
gotta be a good 20 other dolls in that

123
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,630
room it's as if the woman knew she was

124
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,100
about to die and have her soul go into a

125
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,540
doll so she wanted to pick the one that

126
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,490
would scare the people the most also we

127
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,540
find out later that this is Pete and

128
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,770
Sharon's daughter Annabelle and her

129
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,480
boyfriend and so it makes sense that

130
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,500
they would kill her parents for some

131
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
stupid reason so why are they fucking

132
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
around with Mia is this guy been hiding

133
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,209
in this closet the whole time how the do

134
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,890
these psychics manage to travel through

135
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,570
space and time to enter impossible areas

136
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,950
then patiently wait and hide in places

137
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,420
until it's time for them to be scary

138
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,040
dicks again come on guys it is way too

139
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
easy for dolls to get possessed by

140
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,250
murderers if all it takes is a drop of

141
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,840
their blood at least have this chick do

142
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,340
an incantation or a Harry Potter spell

143
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,320
I'll drop a blood are you kidding me

144
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
what officers summed up these

145
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,670
blood-soaked murders by saying in all my

146
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,510
years I have never seen any he went on

147
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,340
to say but after all it is my first day

148
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,130
on the job yes have to pay for me this

149
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,900
diatribe Mia gives John about saving the

150
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,190
baby over her is this obvious as

151
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,840
foreshadowing gets but there is no

152
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,100
incident for the rest of the film where

153
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,450
this notion comes into play and nothing

154
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,950
is said about it ever again

155
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,120
Annabelle just discovering her new ghost

156
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,620
powers decides that using a sewing

157
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,760
machine in the middle of the night is

158
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,290
the best use of those powers but I'm

159
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,700
beginning to think all new ghosts and

160
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,290
demons are given a fucking handbook when

161
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,240
they become self-aware and rule one is

162
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,410
dew point leap in the middle of the

163
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,850
night to annoy the living also this

164
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,169
scene from start to finish is close to

165
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,030
four minutes there's a good 45 seconds

166
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,200
of John trying to figure out how to turn

167
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,880
the sewing machine off Snoopy is 90%

168
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,650
padding the scene is so beautifully lit

169
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,000
and staged that it makes it all the more

170
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,320
irritating that the entire scene

171
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,790
revolves around a sewing machine turning

172
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,620
itself on this is the best looking piece

173
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,810
since alien 3 I'll tell you what it is

174
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,340
stuff that Annabelle is underneath this

175
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,870
dresser and not on the shelf where we

176
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,280
lost Tsar because that means with the

177
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,570
freedom of movement she decided to hide

178
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,220
underneath a dresser rather than finding

179
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,930
a way to hitch a ride to the Maldives I

180
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,870
mean ball dives I mean all this would be

181
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,550
scary if I hadn't seen fourteen hundred

182
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,870
and fifty nine other rocking chair

183
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,160
moments and horror movies before

184
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,630
well I'm done rockin for today that was

185
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,070
good enough to get her curious must be

186
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,950
that room you have to love 60s male

187
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,270
logic about how electronics work

188
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,310
pregnant women love pickles cliche for

189
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,140
we are me together yeah I know like

190
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,540
mustard and pickles oh my god the

191
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,400
dialogue in this movie so I can quit

192
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
talking about it I'm just gonna go ahead

193
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,280
and add another 50 sins here for the

194
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,290
remainder of the film we're never going

195
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,610
to see this doll actually move are we

196
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,220
like not even a blink because yeah I get

197
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,720
it it would be campy like child's play

198
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
if we actually got to see this doll do

199
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,570
her thing but I think it's just more

200
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,760
annoying than anything whoa oh oh if you

201
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,870
spent the money I think you did on this

202
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,310
doll surely it's a highly prized

203
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,020
sought-after item you should at least

204
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,550
try getting your money back or something

205
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,470
since it cost you a few months rent but

206
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,430
I guess we won't be able to see how

207
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,050
creepy the stall is if he doesn't just

208
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,790
simply toss it in the garbage no one

209
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,290
will be seated during this movie's 15

210
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,390
sewing scenes even though there's only

211
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,980
one burner that matters in this scenario

212
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,720
Annabelle turns them all on for maximum

213
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,730
nonsense by the way I know Mia can't see

214
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,050
the popcorn burning but why can't she

215
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,850
smell it would've offed everywhere in

216
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,320
the house they're pregnant super powers

217
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
should have been able to sniff this out

218
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,970
before even mortal men could ah that

219
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,650
gorgeous staple of modern horror the

220
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,270
invisible paranormal activity dragging

221
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,820
scene also is this a doll or is it just

222
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,860
a demon because I don't see the doll or

223
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,630
demon hand anywhere in this shop people

224
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,860
actually heard her scream ex machina

225
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,040
that girl we shall call her Jiffy Pop in

226
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,450
case you confused it with Pasadena New

227
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,580
Hampshire mothers are closer to God than

228
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,200
any other living creature oh yeah I

229
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,980
think I read that in Deuteronomy once

230
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,540
before this will be the prized photo in

231
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,820
my upskirt collection let's say how did

232
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,260
that get in there I swear it threw it

233
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,150
out wow I feel like I'm actually there

234
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,890
this guy's audition what am I supposed

235
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,390
to be afraid of in this movie and why

236
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,890
does she even bother walking around in

237
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,120
another room but the whole point is to

238
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,650
be a scary dick in the next room that is

239
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,540
a severe waste of spiritual energy if

240
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,860
this kid is so adamant about the no

241
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,419
strangers rules and why are these two

242
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:15,950
outside their apartment unattended in a

243
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,270
high-traffic area of the building where

244
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,070
many strangers will be passing by also

245
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,750
these kids never appear or are mentioned

246
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,340
in the film again so not sure what the

247
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,260
point of any of this was well feel free

248
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,240
to stop by anytime it's a good thing we

249
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
randomly saw each other at the apartment

250
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,970
complex at one time and I own a

251
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,289
bookstore that just happens to have a

252
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,729
book you'll need later and then I'm

253
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,260
alpha

254
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,280
meeow keeps getting drawings of a

255
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,600
scenario by which she and her baby are

256
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,040
going to get hit by a truck this is a

257
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,660
waste of time for a ghost for me and

258
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,370
especially me also how much time has

259
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,780
passed I was trying to figure out how

260
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,040
they could even afford their first house

261
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,720
and now they've somehow managed to get

262
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,100
out of their lease which surely would

263
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,360
have come with some sort of penalty and

264
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,070
get an apartment in Pasadena in what a

265
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,820
matter of days

266
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,920
I mean Mia has zero income and John is a

267
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,330
resident right if they don't show us a

268
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,770
behind the scenes illegal drug operation

269
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,150
John has going on at the hospital I'm

270
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,790
calling bull holy Sh that record player

271
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,620
started up by itself that is so scary

272
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,330
still stirring on record players but

273
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,050
while they ctrl-c ctrl-v up next killer

274
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,720
curtains child giggles as they run from

275
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
one place to another in a horror movie

276
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,840
cliche this stupid girl had Mia in a

277
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,190
perfect position to terrorize her not

278
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,900
thirty seconds ago and once again who

279
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,400
are we supposed to fear the grown woman

280
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,900
looking at the baby in the crib the doll

281
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,480
this kid father Perez and his camera get

282
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,510
me something concrete movie someone tell

283
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,460
me the ghost logic here some forces both

284
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,350
closing the door and running towards it

285
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,120
at the same time magic door turns little

286
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,650
girl ghosts into a grown woman ghost

287
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,090
because you should always run your

288
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,100
hauntings like a video game glitch since

289
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,300
I'm offering woodard I will appear

290
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,100
everywhere you guys go from now on if

291
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,780
you guys ever wanted to of the

292
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,570
neighborhood don't hesitate or just

293
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,350
start walking around the neighborhood

294
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,970
I'll find a way to be wherever you are

295
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,530
in the previous shot the doll was

296
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,880
looking directly at me as she put the

297
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,270
baby down

298
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,740
but in this close-up her head is turned

299
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,090
in a completely different direction also

300
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,860
we're almost an hour into this movie and

301
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,360
in a movie that promises lots of evil

302
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,830
doll shenanigans we have still had no

303
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,020
evil volatile issue count a sewing

304
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,520
machine turning on by itself and god

305
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,580
damn it I did not count that by my count

306
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,990
this is the four millionth time this has

307
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,550
happened in a horror movie I am certain

308
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,810
the filmmakers will get a prize for this

309
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,370
in a secret ceremony in Hollywood and

310
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,840
the virgin sacrifice will appease their

311
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,490
God probably copied from another guy

312
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,350
also Mia just walked out of the room how

313
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,790
far could she be down the hall before

314
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,020
the door started closing by itself

315
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,790
making a loud creaking noise the

316
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,990
investigation of this out of nowhere

317
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,490
baby carriage will require the rest of

318
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,140
the movie's runtime Nia has clearly

319
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,580
never seen a horror film and approaches

320
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,110
the Satanic looking baby carriage with

321
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,820
loud screaming emanating from it that

322
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,250
was not there before this might be scary

323
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,540
if the demon claw did anything other

324
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,190
than grabbing her wrist if this hellish

325
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,690
being can somehow control the elevator

326
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,430
why hasn't it won yet and why does it

327
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,750
even allow the elevator to close its

328
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,490
doors the mysteries of movie demons

329
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,590
demon dickhead forgets to lock the only

330
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,880
other exit out of this place

331
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,340
rendering all scares

332
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,020
here's my demons claw just in case you

333
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,370
decided to look down here at this very

334
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,170
moment did the demon put everyone in the

335
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,880
apartment complex to sleep or is MIA the

336
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,740
only person here that was clearly taken

337
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,470
before she got caught up in the cult um

338
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,330
why is her kid picture in this police

339
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,710
report when we heard about Annabel

340
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,060
runnin away from her parents we found

341
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,560
out that she was like 18 so the only

342
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,820
reason why they would show her kid

343
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,740
picture is because for some reason this

344
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,850
movie wants to have a scary scene

345
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,230
involving a kid changing into a girl

346
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,520
woman there was nothing special about

347
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,230
seeing Annabel when she was a kid so

348
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,110
because this here hello yeah you Mimi

349
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,370
and somehow snuck into Evelyn's

350
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,870
bookstore without the omnipresent

351
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,610
Evelyn running into her before this what

352
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,190
what do they want a soul and they won't

353
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,590
stop until they get one and from what I

354
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,090
see in these movies they won't start

355
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,370
until they get one wait come on the

356
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,840
demon can somehow tell the future if it

357
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,430
knows this was gonna happen surely it's

358
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,960
going to know how much of a failure it's

359
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
going to be 25 minutes from now

360
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
well since we find out that he wants me

361
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,790
a soul how about the murder of her baby

362
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,810
lead to that massive cheek we saw Mia

363
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,700
pushing the stroller no baby she drops

364
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,050
the keys then the carriage starts

365
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,820
rolling it was never a baby in her arms

366
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,470
this whole time until the big reveal and

367
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,300
surely the demon knew what was up or it

368
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,500
wouldn't have wasted our goddamn time

369
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,760
it's a good thing she has a bookstore

370
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,380
close by with not only an occult book

371
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,940
section but also a book with a chapter

372
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,200
titled the name of the cult that is

373
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,730
fucking with her Mia officially believes

374
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,440
in demons but leaves her baby just lying

375
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,620
on the floor she goes to investigate 4

376
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,770
million 1/4 million - there's nothing

377
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,120
scarier than when heavy books fall all

378
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,380
around your baby but I am relieved to

379
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,670
see this being from the depths of Hell

380
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,680
has horrible 8 or is from the part of

381
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,700
Hell where they don't believe in harming

382
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,000
kids so

383
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,290
it takes nearly 70 minutes for this

384
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,130
movie to Anabelle

385
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,450
somehow this scene his weight less

386
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,800
terrifying knowing that a demon is

387
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,360
controlling the doll like a less evil

388
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
Jeff Dunham also what's the point what's

389
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,810
the freaking point does it need the doll

390
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,130
what happened to human ghost demon

391
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,899
Annabel demon somehow knows not to be

392
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,190
there as soon as John opens the door

393
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,930
this is essentially at John ex machina

394
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,459
but it's more of an indictment of the

395
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,640
demons slow theatrics this dog may I see

396
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:41,940
it

397
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,440
so did Mina see the demon behind the

398
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,510
door or was that for our benefit why

399
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,890
does she think the doll is the problem

400
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,269
after all the things she's seen also

401
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:50,250
let's not forget let's not forget but

402
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,540
John and me and I used to have some

403
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,279
amazing thumb wars at first I thought it

404
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,540
was some fun character trait for the

405
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,829
couple to have but now I realize the

406
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,450
movie totally forgot it and it was some

407
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,579
cheap way to achieve something so even

408
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,110
though mia has seen this doll wielding

409
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,060
some crazy satanic abilities she still

410
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,740
took the time to place it back in her

411
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,579
freakin kid's room

412
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,110
his family deserves everything that

413
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,790
happens to them also in the original

414
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,380
supposedly true story this movie is

415
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,000
based on Annabelle was a Raggedy Ann

416
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,230
doll I get why they couldn't use that

417
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,760
doll for this movie but I feel they went

418
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,930
a little too far on the creepy look

419
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,430
factor this doll looks like it would

420
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,660
only be purchased by someone that's

421
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,800
hoping it will come to life and kill

422
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,480
other loved ones I still don't

423
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,920
understand what the doll has to do with

424
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,899
this supposed demon John would be

425
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,040
amazing at cinemasins

426
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,560
demons can sometimes use objects as

427
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,930
conduits to achieve their desired goal

428
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,610
except in this case it's ridiculously

429
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,230
ineffective and it's shown it has way

430
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,430
more power and doesn't need to use a

431
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,709
doll demons can't just take Souls Mia

432
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,720
soul needs to be offered to the demon

433
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,100
before I can take it

434
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,360
I guess the demon also hopes you'll

435
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
consult someone who's knowledgeable on

436
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,850
the subject so that you'll know what it

437
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,470
wants it's done a terrible job of

438
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,120
expressing that wish to Mia so far so I

439
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,230
wonder how it was ever supposed to get

440
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,700
what it wanted if it never told her the

441
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,079
very least I've heard of a married

442
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,820
couple that the church has worked with

443
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,079
in the past they were way too expensive

444
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,579
for this movie and there between

445
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,320
conjuring zatt the moment when we do in

446
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,910
the meantime and I can't have Leah

447
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,190
anywhere near that oh you tried getting

448
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,930
rid of it at one time and threw it in

449
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,190
the fucking garbage you didn't try

450
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,750
anything else and yet you think it's

451
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,810
hopeless

452
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,160
why not the trunk again I'm going to

453
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,730
hammer this

454
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,829
how does mian know it's the doll she's

455
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,540
experienced things with the actual demon

456
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,160
and with the actual Annabelle with no

457
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,810
doll attached but she sees the doll

458
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,579
float in the air once and the problem is

459
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,540
definitely that all

460
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,220
kind of baseball game is being played on

461
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,420
the west coast so late at night that

462
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,550
there aren't other people on the roads

463
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,000
so many questions damn this demon was

464
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,040
patient it waited that whole car ride to

465
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,380
do anything to father Perez how much it

466
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,130
wants that's why to take sure father

467
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,960
Perez plays the pronoun game but we've

468
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,340
already established the demon wants a

469
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,990
soul so why is it being said like it's a

470
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,590
big reveal

471
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,390
and she said it that I can't take this

472
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,770
you you said that it has to be offered

473
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,540
why did they ever think the demon wanted

474
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,550
Leah's soul and if I somehow missed that

475
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,170
why didn't they ever consider that the

476
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,150
demon wanted Mia's soul father Perez was

477
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,900
in an accident

478
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,600
he said demon can affect telephone

479
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,010
reception but I don't know how this

480
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,510
draws it any closer to getting me a soul

481
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,860
there I am leaving now someone hangs up

482
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,270
on you when you get a dial tone cliche

483
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,890
so the demon can impersonate father

484
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,560
Perez now this is where the t1000 this

485
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,120
demon only wasn't visible until now

486
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,830
because Mia and Evelyn were also looking

487
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,270
at the ceiling with the narrow geography

488
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,830
of a film camera and have no peripheral

489
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,490
vision so can the doll just appear out

490
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,660
of ether now it's supposed to be a

491
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,190
physical object right like the doll

492
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,020
itself has no powers but the demonic

493
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,820
presence inside of it does so how the

494
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,960
hell did the doll get back here without

495
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
anyone bringing it in and who was

496
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,420
adventurous enough to give this

497
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,490
hitchhiking doll a ride or did she walk

498
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,040
back ah red crayon god damn it's about

499
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,600
time you couldn't figure out the fucking

500
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,580
crayons you can stop elevators up

501
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,230
telephones closed doors with your minds

502
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,030
but crayons eluded you until now and why

503
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,440
so many of the same message were you

504
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,490
worried that if he wrote it only a

505
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,080
couple of times she wouldn't see it also

506
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,150
this is classic pronoun game later the

507
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,410
demon finally spells it out and says

508
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,820
your soul which I think could have been

509
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,200
crayon in the first 30 minutes of the

510
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,690
movie

511
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,000
tell her how she can give you what you

512
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,070
want I can make it right

513
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,650
this is what Ruby meant how do either of

514
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,970
these women know that this will bring

515
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,560
Leah back to Mia hella Mia is only going

516
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,210
off of one person's intuition but the

517
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,680
reason the demon is with you is it wants

518
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,210
a soul and she didn't even hear what

519
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,530
father Perez said to her husband in the

520
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,030
hospital also this seems like a very

521
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,890
convoluted way for a demon to collect a

522
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,570
soul instead of farting around for the

523
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,010
last couple weeks moving dolls around

524
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,570
and couldn't have just gone to me and

525
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,400
said so I'm going to take your baby and

526
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,690
the only way you're gonna save her is if

527
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,190
you give me your soul or someone else's

528
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,260
soul got it good also does the doll

529
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,120
actually have to do with this we saw the

530
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
blood go in the eye and we've seen

531
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,820
Annabelle's ghost appear around the doll

532
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,620
but Annabelle is not the demon that's

533
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,240
trying to collect the soul so does she

534
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,890
just happen to be around and even if we

535
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,570
are to assume that the cult raised this

536
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,130
demon or I think all of the other cult

537
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,690
members would may be aware of this and

538
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,980
hang out around Mia and their sheep

539
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,690
robes or whatever the cult members wore

540
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,030
back then also if any soul would do then

541
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,950
why didn't the demon also honk-honk are

542
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,480
you telling me only a female soul will

543
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,120
do that's racist God on their sacrifice

544
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,240
and our sacrifices touch God's heart and

545
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,310
move his head except maybe when your

546
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,840
sacrifice is to offer your soul to the

547
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,670
devil so we get one death this entire

548
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,020
movie after Pete and share and get

549
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,850
murdered basically off screen I mean

550
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,380
Annabelle and her Charles Manson boy toy

551
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,030
are killed but that just kicks the main

552
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,800
story in motion also these are the only

553
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,540
three deaths of any consequence in all

554
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,280
three of the film's so far made up in

555
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,780
the conjuring universe if all these

556
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,070
items are possessed in some form

557
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,300
shouldn't everything be encased in

558
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,250
something also I was not aware that

559
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,930
glass will protected us from giving up

560
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,520
our soul to bat crazy demons I guess

561
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,290
once this doll gets one soul it has the

562
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,760
patience to sit behind a glass case

563
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,550
until it's profitable to make a sequel

564
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,880
where the hell did you launch update at

565
00:16:45,880 --> 00:17:23,350
TELUS evil I tell you I'm Chucky and I'm

566
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,520

567
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,260
come look blow up the dam step No

568
