1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:12,980
star wars episode 1 a film that famously

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,789
lives in infamy and I do mean infamy

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,070
from Gungans to midi-chlorians I think

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,539
it's safe to say this movie spawned more

5
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,039
social outrage and the burning of the

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,930
Great Library of Alexandria and that was

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,820
real bad all my favorite books got

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,350
burned up in that like this coloring

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,539
book for example mustaches of the former

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,640
Soviet Union it only comes with the

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,860
crayon brown that are not color outside

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,930
the lines or else Papa will have to go

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,690
back to a concrete hole in the ground

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,860
when people were watching this film they

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,570
had to have insane themselves I wish I

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,700
can experience this for myself I wish I

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,140
could be there little did they know

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,050
their wish was already granted this is

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,630
Star Wars Episode one The Phantom Menace

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,579
for ps1 ok it's kind of rare to get a

21
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,469
game like this it's not some spin-off

22
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,750
it's actually just Star Wars Episode one

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,120
The Phantom Menace and yeah it pretty

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,860
much is just a scene-by-scene in the

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,479
spirit of the movie but obviously there

26
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,640
are some deviations first most glaring

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,140
difference of course being the inclusion

28
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,659
of wobbly pixel each imp face not that I

29
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,010
have anything against that is to say

30
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,990
you're all absolutely bone chillingly

31
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,299
deformed what is that guts coming out of

32
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:23,180
the floor that's interesting cuz it

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,860
looks an awful lot like poison to me no

34
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,080
you don't you son of a bitch this game

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,580
would have been fun had it not been for

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,710
the vomit inducing top-down angle that

37
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,900
is any slight tilt and way too close to

38
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,909
your character it's hard to tell where

39
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,619
or what anything is and if you don't

40
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,150
find out what to do you'll still have

41
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,680
the nausea to deal with

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,820
Oh oh my god I what is going on that way

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,170
yeah I don't want to have anything to do

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,770
with that op1 let's take Path number two

45
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,060
obi-wan you're gonna be alright bro

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,250
I'm gonna be able to walk that one off

47
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,200
so this is cannon then yeah probably

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,530
getting back together for episodes 2 &amp; 3

49
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,959
lissa clumsy but missus still have no

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,270
Jar Jar you're so quirky and lovable

51
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,350
Mesa

52
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,690
you should doing grab anything for you

53
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:24,180
buddy let's go so long Jar Jar we hardly

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,950
knew you before you were viciously

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,070
murdered by an actual firing squad in an

56
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,770
official Star Wars game for real most of

57
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,060
this game is just traversing the

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,410
landscapes of the film with familiar

59
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,390
characters it's a bit slum and clunky at

60
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,550
times but I've played much worse I do

61
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,020
find it interesting that they tried to

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,940
do a scene by scene but I don't know

63
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,980
that it works which events happen then

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,690
the ones in the movie or the ones in

65
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,940
this game split timeline much the

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,980
graphics are generally appealing for ps1

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,690
though and the environments are varied

68
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,489
so yeah whatever I'll give it a pass

69
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,340
next up we have Jedi power battles where

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,450
Sam Jackson looks like he just

71
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,310
encountered a large spider when obi-wan

72
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,299
looks like he's listening to his

73
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,860
friend's parents fight during an awkward

74
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:11,400
family dinner

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,690
you can choose from all your favorite

76
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,690
characters mace windu obi-wan qui-gon

77
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,739
jinn and Pullo people pío pío Koon well

78
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,879
you don't know who this guy is here

79
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,840
you've been living under a rock or

80
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,150
something like probably asks he's a for

81
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,800
God forsaken creature of the night

82
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,959
at first glance I'm not exactly sure

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,400
what the difference is between this and

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,989
the last game it looks and plays very

85
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,910
similarly but I can say this one is

86
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,099
definitely a lot less disorienting it's

87
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,330
got a much better field of view I

88
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,220
suppose this game could be described as

89
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,410
more arcade like in nature there are

90
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,390
some minor platforming elements mixed in

91
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,040
but it's mostly just about dismembering

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,500
your enemies in style what are you

93
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,120
laughing at Yoda something funny

94
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,260
something you want to share with the

95
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,720
class

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,940
you're laughing at me so what I'm funny

97
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,829
now I'm a funny guy just because I'm

98
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,630
dressed like a clown I suppose you think

99
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,549
I should never got either there also

100
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,019
exist some flash games about the

101
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,400
prequels I couldn't find any worth

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,079
mentioning on Episode one but there are

103
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,700
a few based off Revenge of the Sith the

104
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,530
first one being called Jedi verse Jedi

105
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:21,130
blades of light

106
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,140
I'm sorry I didn't mean any rep you boys

107
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,410
I can see you're busy everyone panic in

108
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,880
do you not remember your days of

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
friendship what has brought you to such

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,830
savage violence I can't look

111
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,120
occasionally one of them will fall over

112
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
like a child and then get back up come

113
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
on guys play clean keep it above the

114
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,300
belt don't make me come in there well

115
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,920
there is actually a reason this all

116
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,230
looks so strange these flash games here

117
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,400
were based on a marketing campaign

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,980
around toys for Episode three to animate

119
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,540
this it looks like they pose the actual

120
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,460
toys and stop-motion no like this thing

121
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,750
they're standing on here even in the

122
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,280
background you can actually buy that

123
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:05,689
comes with the orange goo and everything

124
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,620
while we're already looking at these

125
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,210
weird flash games there's another one

126
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,889
that ties in with the toys Revenge of

127
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,870
the Sith scene bot I think it's actually

128
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,580
supposed to be called George Lucas

129
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,800
special edition simulator why make one

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,120
movie when you can just keep adding to

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,280
the same one forever just put just put

132
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,969
that there

133
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:24,360
one here more MORE it must be perfect

134
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,770
never clean never clean I know what

135
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,330

136

139
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,860
there's a hard choice given that both

140
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,270
the prospective candidates seem to

141
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,770
contract in a bad case of rigor mortis

142
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,699

00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,540
here that is this is something else

167
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,970
nope oh who is that oh come on Jar Jar

168
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,230
leave me alone for a second all right

169
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,390
I'm over here trying to plant your dad a

170
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,630
new moon listen this game is great with

171
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,600
all its putting trees down in the

172
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,370
Kobey's but it doesn't really hold a

173
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,500
candle to my personal favorite gungun

174
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,770
Adventure slash spiritual experience jar

175
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,540
jar's Jar Jar Jar ocean here we go get

176
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,980
it he's gonna get it this time poor

177
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,710
little guy can never get that jar open

178
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,360
but what about the art of the podrace to

179
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,980
the dismay of some it played a huge part

180
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,230
in the first prequel movie I always

181
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,030
loved pod racing in fact I think of all

182
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,080
the scenes in the prequel trilogy

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
Anakin's pod race against the boba is

184
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,070
easily my favorite each pod racer is

185
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,270
built uniquely for the character

186
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,740
designated to it so there's a very

187
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,570
visceral sense of tension and imminent

188
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,460
danger that adds to the drama at any

189
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,200
moment your favorite player could be

190
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,990
torn to shreds and that's really what we

191
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,680
all want deep down isn't it wow this is

192
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,920
episode 1 racer for the n64 I don't know

193
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,230
why they called it racer and not pod

194
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,700
racer I guess they thought people would

195
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,950
associate pods with peas and let's face

196
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,660
it no one likes those things look at

197
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,920
this peas is it's hard to squish

198
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,770
the frozen ones I can't do it now I

199
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,330
remember in this game you got to buy

200
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,950
pieces from Watteau to improve your

201
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,920
podracer you know whatto the blue guy

202
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
that looked like if gonzo from the

203
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,550
Muppets had sex with Jeff Goldblum from

204
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,360
the fly oh god get it out of my head

205
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,560
life finds a way

206
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:37,360
I don't know maybe it's got something to

207
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,530
do with the fact that it sounds like

208
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,060
you're about to take yourself out back

209
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,310
and go drink bleach the feeling of speed

210
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,630
they were able to accomplish here was

211
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,820
impressive given that it was n64 the

212
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,710
controls were tight too it felt like an

213
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,390
accurate recreation of a pod race which

214
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm assuming is what they were going for

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,240
and not to mention there were tons of

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,770
awesome locations to race in and a

217
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,390
multitude of racers to choose from I

218
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,410
think it's safe to say I love this one

219
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,230
Oh looks like Anakin won't be making the

220
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,449
Tampa so - after all they also made a

221
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,920
gameboy color version of this that opens

222
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,639
with a sweet remix of duel of the fates

223
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,170
the game itself isn't much to write home

224
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,580
about though

225
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,380
ah yes so this is the sound of true debt

226
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,850
well I guess that's it that's all of

227
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,180
them

228
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:32,870
tune in next time on super bombad racing

229
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:46,790
I can't be good

230
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,870
what is going on here

231
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,630
what's a bombad I don't know who was in

232
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,519
charge of this but they are clearly and

233
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,580
unrecognized genius you had like all the

234
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,060
Star Wars lexicon and you chose this you

235
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,670
went with bombad is that some sort of

236
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,620
artistic thing you guys got going on

237
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,019
here don't want to be too cliche no it's

238
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,670
all good really you guys just keep doing

239
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,100
you know but I can't move past this part

240
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,350
because what's a bombad is it this thing

241
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,420
Jar Jar is riding on is that a bomb bad

242
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,190
well no actually cuz that's what's known

243
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,980
as a tri bubble Bongo see I've done my

244
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,380
research I took to the internet to see

245
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,300
what a bomb bat could be after all and

246
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,670
it turns out bombad may refer to the

247
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,519
Gungan word for a superb so this game's

248
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,040
title literally translates to super

249
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,709
superb racing what can I say that's

250
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,850
pretty super superb in itself come on

251
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:47,029
why are you looking at me like that

252
00:10:47,029 --> 00:11:32,000
very very bad
