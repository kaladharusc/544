1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,230
hello everybody my name is markiplier

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,389
and welcome back to sort the court now

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,130
the last time I played this game was

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,530
almost two years ago to the day and

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,730
since then it's received one more major

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,039
update so I'm gonna play it and in

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,630
addition to that you get to play as a

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,090
king or queen and I don't think that was

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,090
in the game before but now I'm gonna be

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,109
a queen I'm beautiful hello my lady I'll

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,949

answers okay our city is still very

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,530
small right now but it certainly has a

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,960
potential to grow perhaps one day we

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,610
will have a bustling metropolis and

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,079
you'll be invited to join the Council of

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,660

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,879

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,740
that's not good the Treasury is empty

107
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,660
m'lady we could raise taxes a bit

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,010
further but the people won't like it

109
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,400
much

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,090
should we try no it's okay we'll make up

111
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,100
the gold somehow we still need to

112
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,360
resolve the issue of having no money

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,310
we'll get to it eventually but not at

114
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,710
the cost of happiness you seems like you

115
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,320
need some gold in exchange for a few

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
souls maybe how about it no suppose

117
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
you'll have to look elsewhere for the

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,620
coin then yeah that would just make him

119
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,210
unhappy and that's what I just didn't do

120
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,240

121
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,400

the city's population is growing

725
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,790
steadily in our records of citizenship

726
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,830
indicate that 250 people now call the

727
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,630
city home but the bigger city will need

728
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,310
to maintain even higher happiness in

729
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,200
order to keep people satisfied make sure

730
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,580
you pay attention to the citizens and

731
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,750
their issues to raise our happiness

732
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,520

735
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,290
searching the land for a new ruler to

736
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:12,890
join them

737
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,180

981
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:14,309
yarn Oh need plenty of tuna of course

982
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,229
but surely it could be worth the cost

983
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:18,420
well should I hire this cat to find er

984
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,150

986
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:27,029
want oh well nothing to do but wait okay

987
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:28,589

I'll take it the spirits are pleased

991
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,239

992
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,190
them an offering of gold I know the

993
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,900
spirit world always appreciates gold and

994
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,130
it might prevent them from haunting us

995
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:41,699

00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,310
gold generating machine take some time

see however I have been shall we say

1303
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,030
shortened this is due largely in fact of

1304
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,650
the actions of your team of wood cutters

1305
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,480
my home has been chopped clean through

1306
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,850
in your reckless pursuit of expansion

1307
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,830

01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,910
considers all the members of their City

1414
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,250
friends the council science has said the

1415
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,680
most wonderful idea yes yes oK we've

1416
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,270
devised an idea to broadcast music

1417
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:59,040
across the entire city using a network

1418
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,230
of sonic hardware I'm not sure if this

1419
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,880
would be useful but wouldn't it be fun

1420
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,350
to try in the name of science I'm

1421
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,090
certain we could do it on a budget as

1422
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:09,440
well a mere 100 gold sheets of ice that

1423
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,080
sounds terrible that sounds like the

1424
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,950
worst idea even if you're gonna just

1425
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,200
start blasting music everywhere in our

1426
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:24,600
kingdom the streets will be filled with

1427
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,090
song I think that's a bad idea I think

1428
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,890
that's a bad idea but I did it anyway I

1429
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:31,020
don't know why wait what the frick bones

1430

01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,180
cleared up

1578
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,040
once Queen chanterelle realized she won

1579
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,390
she was willing to split the marsh with

1580
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,070
the ocean Kingdom sometimes a leader

1581
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,510
just needs a bit of respect you know

1582

1605
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,390

1609
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,240
our city to new heights though it may

1610
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:02,840
take
