1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
check this out ready

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,130
that handsome man is not me but that is me

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,410
I don't know what any of this says he is in German cool right

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,300
yeah

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,020
your brother

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,020
this

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,020
I don't know where he is

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,860
supply run

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,600
areas there's a little bastard now you're late breakfast

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,269
I have an admission

11
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,020
I tried to put this in yesterday's log that was like it really wreck the

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,300
momentum of the scene

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,730
I crashed the phantom 4 yesterday that it could not have been more my fault

14
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,790
literally one hundred percent my fault

15
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,600
I trying to get the shower skating along the pier and then the drone was going

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,920
like in parallel with me and I crashed into a boat like a park big old like

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,100
stupid boat not like the boat with somebody in it that was like important

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,100
or anything

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,850
and then it crashed right there

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,630
this is the drone controller and this is how you can fold the drugs most

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,650
important detail

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,450
it takes two hands to control the drone always this is the boosted word

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,170
controller

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,070
you gotta hold down the safety and then hit the accelerator this is a minimum

25
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,740
three handed operation and yesterday I was trying to do with only two hands

26
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,220
I do aspire to be the world's greatest i have to aspire to be the world's

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,569
greatest drone operator while flying boosted board operator but until then

28
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,190
I'm not do know that I got all those amazing shots by myself while riding the

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,190
boosted board including this majestic shot

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:37,200
that's all there will continue to be drawn cinematography in this blog

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,890
I will work to get better but I will do everything I can not to crash this thing

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,180

Thank You Jared and charity I don't mean to sound ungrateful i appreciate the

76
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,139
glasses but maybe but maybe all that packaging wasn't like one hundred

77
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:41,699
percent necessary because now I have to clean this up and it was just a pair of

78
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,150
like plastic sunglasses so I think they would have been fine and just like a

79
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,460
regular envelope personally thank you for all that stuff pile of mail time
