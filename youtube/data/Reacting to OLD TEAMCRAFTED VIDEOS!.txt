before I even in your video to bring you

616

00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,010
minecraft channel yet we interrupted

618
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,290
this is February 8th 2012 this was

619
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:38,330
barely after 2012 basically 2011 this

620
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,359
was the very first Minecraft series I

621
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,720
was featured in any thing anyway or

622
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,859
anything well not the the first or maybe

623
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:51,020
it was the first I think it was I did

624
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,640
not have my youtube channel at this

625
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,080
point for Minecraft that deadlocks empty

626
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,010
YouTube channel a channel you're

627
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,460
watching right now I did not have it I

628
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,920
did not plan on even making this YouTube

629
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,460
channel

630
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,560
I had a runescape youtube channel before

631
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,130
this Adam convinced me to make this

632
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,410
YouTube channel and that's why I had

633
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,030
this YouTube channel and that was in

634
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:16,990
early 2012 a little bit after the series

635
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:24,340
I do that hey guys Skype here with Donna

636
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,330
bowls and deadlocks and in this series

637
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,970
we're going to be surviving on this

638
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,340
island called I can't just looking

639
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,700
around like where am i this is a cool

640
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,220
man I'm pretty sure I only have like

641
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,900
tried an only crappy laptop of this

642
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,530
portion below and so uh yeah basically

643
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,480
this is set on hardmode and we have to

644
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,070
survive on this little card nerd was my

645
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,650
biggest mistake challenges or whatever

646
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,540
so that would be pretty easy to do yeah

647
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:58,210
so many fun let's do this so what is our

648
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:01,420
first secret is time well I would really

649
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,020
recommend make serious stuff box because

650
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,420
once it gets dark we will be screwed and

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,650
an idea team crafted started off as an

787
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,859
idea and I get this question a lot I get

00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,900
idea and there's a lot of you know

795

00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,010
Boston the idea was brought up before oh

805
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,200

812
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,700
network and we were starting to do

813
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,770
videos again you know collabs many games

814
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:58,840
were starting to get popular and I just

815
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,800
I brought up an idea in the call I was

816
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,860
like you know it wouldn't it be kind of

817
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,510
you know a good idea to you know make

818
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,630
like a group like like the yogscast but

819
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,240
not like the augs cast because at the

820
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,160
time the yogscast they were doing pretty

821
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,780
good they were a fun group I don't think

822
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,630
they were just uh they were just you

823
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,830
know minecraft even though their

824
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,500
majority just minecraft I was like why

825
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,960
don't we do a group like the Ox cast and

826
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,360
like you know it would be like big it

827
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,620
would be cool it would be like really

828
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:34,030
fun to and you know group affair and

829
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,480
friends or recording anyways why not and

830
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,660
at the time everybody in the call

831
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,370
actually including Adam was just like no

832
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,650
we don't want a copy ox cast we're just

833
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,380
copiers why would we do that that just

834
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,010
doesn't seem like a good idea so that

835
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,410
was kind of that and then you know pax

836
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,910
was a few weeks away and then you know

837
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,590
we started actually this was a time we

838
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,150
literally just started hanging out with

839
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:00,790
like you know Mitch in Jerome started

840
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,630
doing more with Quentin

841
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,900
and at the time I was the only person

842
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,910
who talked to Sundy I was the only

843
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,550
person who talked to Sundy he just got

844
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,850
back from a blonde break on on YouTube

845
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:17,720
and I I you know was friends with Sundy

846
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,780
and started talking to you know Jerome

847
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,410
itch

848
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,750
you know introduced everybody everybody

849
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,670
introduced each other and we started

850
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,100
doing videos together and within those

851
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,500
couple weeks we started you know talking

852
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,630
more and more on skype started doing a

853
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,580
little bit more and more and then it was

854
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,660
a few days you know till packs which you

855
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,840
know is that Skype call actually Adam

856
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,070
was not in that Skype call but the

857
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,380
majority of us were were I think it was

858
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,500
the night before we all flew off to pax

859
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,040
it was a photo of all of us in a Skype

860
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,630
call I don't know if you guys have seen

861
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,180
on Twitter but I mean it has a bunch of

862
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,010
retweets and likes I think Sundy posted

863
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,020
on this Twitter but it has like a lot of

864
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,490
retweets and likes or maybe everybody

865
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,170
post it on Twitter and we're like all on

866
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,600
the webcam doing video chat and this was

867
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,390
like the night before PAX East we were

868
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,870
all getting along like really good and

869
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:14,000
you know we went to pax this was the

870
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,050
first time I met Adam I met everybody

871
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:22,160
pax Boston and you know we all stayed in

872
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,560
the same hotel everybody stayed in the

873
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:29,270
same exact hotel and long story short we

874
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,400
all really just kicked it off really

875
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,980
good in person and after pax I think you

876
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,900
know we even talked about their a little

877
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,270
bit it's like hey you know we've talked

878
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:44,600
about making the group on YouTube we

879
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,710
don't know what it's called yet but

880
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:49,040
making a group on YouTube and we don't

881
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,960
know 100% sure yet but you know I think

882
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,910
we might go ahead and do this and this

883
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:56,270
was you know once this was Adams idea at

884
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:59,960
this point I brought up the idea Adam

885
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:06,950
created it so it we all kicked it off

886
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:11,300
really good and you know we went to box

887
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,080
Boston packs you know had fun we came

888
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,960
back start

889
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,869
more minecraft videos but then we got

890
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:21,359
pretty serious about the the group thing

891
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:25,170
and it happened pretty fast we're like

892
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,170
okay dude let's make a group 100% let's

893
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,000
make a group let's get some members it's

894
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,190
gonna be awesome you know that's when

895
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,460
you know at the time there was me

896
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:42,390
Adam Quentin

897
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:48,890
Jerome Mitch Sundy caveman films Seto

898
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:55,410
and then we got box to be to do the do

899
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,650
the artwork and she was part of it too

900
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:02,550
as the artist and caveman films ended up

901
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:07,650
not stayin not being in it so before we

902
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,940
actually officially once we didn't

903
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,160
officially launch for a long time we got

904
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,440
the artwork done first and we all had

905
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,390
the same artwork but we didn't we

906
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,460
weren't officially called team crafted

907
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,940
for actually a long time about get to

908
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,060
that so we got the artwork and then you

909
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,859
know we started doing videos together

910
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:29,070
for actually quite a few months before

911
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,200
we were officially quote-unquote team

912
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,410
crafted before we made the YouTube

913
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:40,920
channel and all that stuff it was Donna

914
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,670
Bowles was in it and then eventually

915
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:47,010
Kermit plays one of their real-life

916
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:51,200
friends you know came in it as well and

917
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,240
you know again we just started doing

918
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,330
videos from home and just grinding

919
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:59,700
grinding grinding minecraft videos like

920
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,480
a lot and we were all growing at a super

921
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,030
duper fast pace unofficially officially

922
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:09,330
being team crafted so we were team

923
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:13,349
crafted but not officially yet so we got

924
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:16,349
a manager which I believe was

925
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:19,440
recommended by Sundy which his name was

926
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:26,940
Douglas and you know he basically was

927
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,680
the manager of the group because we were

928
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:28,990
about

929
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:32,380
start off we made the YouTube channel

930
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,619
team crafted we hired blue monkey and

931
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:40,150
weed lion to be part of the animators /

932
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:46,060
artists of the team crafted and we they

933
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,980
did the animation we got the animation

934
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,160
done we released the team crafted

935
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,500
YouTube channel and that's when the

936
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,230
talks about getting a team crafted

937
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,310
gaming house was being done and this is

938
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,990
honestly where things started going

939
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:05,020
south a little bit because there's a

940
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,030
actually quite quite a bit of issues

941
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:11,110
with the the team crafted house it you

942
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:13,150
know we looked into the house everybody

943
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,730
you know we're all growing at a huge

944
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:19,140
crazy pace making a boatload of money

945
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:22,150
that more money than you know most

946
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,890
people our age did and we were all very

947
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:28,900
young as well so we're like okay let's

948
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,210
get the team crafted house instead of

949
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,740
thinking logically and just getting like

950
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:36,700
you know a normal five bedroom even like

951
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,640
four or five bedroom neighborhood house

952
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,440
how about we go find a freaking mansion

953
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,030
spend way too much money on it and have

954
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,250
an idea of making a gaming house in a

955
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,780
mansion even though we were probably the

956
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,780
first people do that so we did we ended

957
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,310
up you know renting the mansion and you

958
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,840
know when you rent a house you have to

959
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,190
do a contract for a certain amount of

960
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:04,030
time or and the house was a crazy crazy

961
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:07,300
amount of money per month just the rent

962
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,700
not including the utility bills the you

963
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:14,440
know internet costs and everything so it

964
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,390
was you know becoming an issue and this

965
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:18,369
was this about the time that you know we

966
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:18,750
kicked

967
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,900
seto out a team crafted just because you

968
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,580
know it it was starting to become more

969
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,040
business versus friends which was you

970
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,630
know also an issue but you know at the

971
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,920
time it's just like you know we all want

972
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,750
to grow and we all want you know better

973
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,270
quality toward the fans as well as well

974
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:37,450
as we grow and have businesses you know

975
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,849
support us so we could keep the mansion

976
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,839
but it just started kind of like

977
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:46,279
separating everybody a little bit I

978
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:47,450
guess

979
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:50,450
you know everybody had a split amount

980
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:53,180
which they paid towards the rent on the

981
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,400
team crafted house which you know people

982
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,739
ended up not paying and you know Adam

983
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,720
ended up paying a good chunk of money

984
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:04,549
which you know upset him a lot which is

985
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:06,140
understandable because you know

986
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,940
everybody ever it was at this point we

987
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,349
got the team craft house at first it was

988
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:12,380
pretty fun and cool but everyone started

989
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,269
kind of doing their own thing even

990
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:15,559
though we were a team it's like right

991
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:16,730
when we got the house right when people

992
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,859
were starting to live you know with each

993
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:20,509
other or you know going there and

994
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:21,889
staying there for a decent amount of

995
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:29,960
time then it's it was like everyone

996
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,580
started separating doing their own thing

997
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,909
so settles out Kermit's out it was just

998
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:38,690
you know us and the house and a lot of

999
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:41,270
money was being paid money was becoming

1000
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:44,449
you know a stress because it was more

1001
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:49,310
expensive than we all anticipated so I

1002
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,839
guess it kind of like you know made some

1003
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,779
people you know made made everybody just

1004
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:55,520
kind of bitter or and stressed out when

1005
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,500
it came to like you know what do we get

1006
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,730
this mansion it for you know no one's

1007
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:01,730
gonna record in it no one's going to you

1008
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,290
know film in it everyone's doing their

1009
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:07,159
own thing you know there was you know

1010
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:09,710
some I'm not gonna say specific names

1011
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,819
even though it's not really that big of

1012
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:13,099
a deal some of you know the people in

1013
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:15,529
team crafted were getting their you know

1014
01:09:15,529 --> 01:09:19,069
own you know brand deals for themselves

1015
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:21,230
and not the group or helping out the

1016
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,429
group they're getting brand deals and

1017
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,409
that was benefiting themselves versus

1018
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:27,859
the group so it was again it was just

1019
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,330
starting to split off it was just

1020
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:33,969
starting to split off and that's when

1021
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,969
you know it was didn't last very long

1022
01:09:37,969 --> 01:09:39,770
when the group was actually announced

1023
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:40,969
the YouTube channel we're doing little

1024
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,920
vlogs but nobody was really uploading on

1025
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,869
it even though we got the channels like

1026
01:09:44,869 --> 01:09:49,549
over 1mill in like two months it was at

1027
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:53,230
this point where you know Adam

1028
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,900
I was getting tired of the group I was

1029
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,040
getting tired of the group I was getting

1030
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,650
tired of the stress the over-commitment

1031
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,140
the ideas that everybody had and wanted

1032
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,090
to do but ended up not happening the

1033
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:06,730
high hopes that never happened

1034
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:10,060
and I think you know everybody could

1035
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,890
feel that so that's why everybody split

1036
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,840
off and Adam kind of like you know came

1037
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,489
to me and he's like dude I think I'm

1038
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:17,950
gonna leave team crafted and I told him

1039
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,980
like you know I actually I'm feeling the

1040
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,560
same exact thing I think I think I'm

1041
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,010
gonna leave team crafte - so Quinton was

1042
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,290
in the call at that time and he also

1043
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,290
felt that way so at the same exact time

1044
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:35,500
without even talking to anybody which

1045
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,180
honestly this was kind of childish upon

1046
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,420
our part as well we just tweeted without

1047
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,180
telling anybody hey guys we're leaving

1048
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,360
team crafted and it got a lot of

1049
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,750
traction it was like oh crap it was like

1050
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,550
nobody knew Mitch didn't know Jerome

1051
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,030
didn't know Sonny didn't know and we

1052
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:57,130
just just left and it was kind of

1053
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,480
childish we probably should have all

1054
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,970
just talked it out but again we were all

1055
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:05,739
kids world just young kids so once we

1056
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:09,060
left and about the time we left they

1057
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:13,120
drove Mitch Sundy they invited Ryan XR

1058
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,690
PMX Ryan to teen crafted so it was

1059
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,210
already kind of starting to become their

1060
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:22,330
their group their squad doing more which

1061
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:25,300
was fine so they you know they were team

1062
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,550
crafted we were out a team crafted they

1063
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,150
were team crafted Mitch Jerome's son D

1064
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:35,080
Ryan they were you know they were team

1065
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,239
crafted but you know after we left it

1066
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:39,220
just still went downhill that nobody

1067
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,710
uploaded on it and it just kind of just

1068
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,830
went stale I guess you could say just

1069
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,110
once we left it just nothing happened to

1070
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:48,810
it nothing happened at all to it and

1071
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,450
that's you know we all went our separate

1072
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,970
ways and we all did our own thing Adam

1073
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:58,570
started sky media in a few different

1074
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:00,790
versions he had sky a sky media version

1075
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:03,550
a Frey like right after team crafted not

1076
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:06,030
too far after team crafted

1077
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:10,050
and you know I was doing a lot of things

1078
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,949
with Adam you know Jason even though I

1079
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:16,530
think Jason was still in team crafted he

1080
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:20,429
didn't officially you didn't officially

1081
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:25,079
leave I don't think but yeah we all kind

1082
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:26,460
of like met our separate ways

1083
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,440
except I'd was doing stuff with Adam

1084
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,110
still we weren't team crafted anymore

1085
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:34,769
it was just team crafted was a majority

1086
01:12:34,769 --> 01:12:39,239
of team crafted the highlight the climax

1087
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:41,190
of team crafted was when we weren't even

1088
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,260
officially announced as a group we just

1089
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,539
all had the same artwork but people kind

1090
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:47,309
of knew we were like I said we were a

1091
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:49,289
fish we were unofficially officially

1092
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:51,630
team crafted that's when we did the best

1093
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:53,999
when we you know actually made the team

1094
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:55,889
crafted channel and we got the the you

1095
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:57,960
know the team crafted mansion that's

1096
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,039
when things started going downhill

1097
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,309
because it was almost too fast too

1098
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:06,090
serious too much money and a lot of high

1099
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,820
hopes that never happened

1100
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,610
but it was it was fun it was in venture

1101
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,260
we all learned from it and it helped us

1102
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:18,059
all grow and it was and then you know

1103
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:24,389
nothing happened to team crafted but but

1104
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:30,179
a few years later we you know all got

1105
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:32,360
together did a team crafted reunion and

1106
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:36,749
we did what you call it team crafted

1107
01:13:36,749 --> 01:13:38,219
reunion which ended up being vision

1108
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:42,570
squad which was actually very very well

1109
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,920
organized vision squad a little

1110
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,420
organized we actually did a lot of

1111
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,699
videos for vision squad and it was very

1112
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:52,400
fun the only issue with vision squad was

1113
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,489
it was a lot of work doing it

1114
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:58,769
professionally and everybody was so busy

1115
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:02,869
and we had multiple managers and

1116
01:14:02,869 --> 01:14:05,489
expectations and goals to reach but

1117
01:14:05,489 --> 01:14:07,530
everybody was so busy doing their own

1118
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,599
thing that it was so hard to find time

1119
01:14:09,599 --> 01:14:11,989
for vision squad and that's why it just

1120
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:16,979
like totally just ended up not being

1121
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:19,920
anything I mean we grinded out a lot of

1122
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,989
videos and then we couldn't continue

1123
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:25,940
because it was just a lot of work but

1124
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:28,080
yeah that's the end of team crafted

1125
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,120
slash mission squad what happened to the

1126
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,090
vision squad channel I have no idea I

1127
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:39,120
don't believe any of us own it but

1128
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,870
that's that's that's the story that is

1129
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:49,199
the story man and it was just a whole

1130
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:53,929
roller coaster but it was fun it was fun

1131
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:58,250
do I have any plans in the future

1132
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,140
streaming with Adam right now eventually

1133
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,370
I'm gonna be doing a new streaming

1134
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:05,940
