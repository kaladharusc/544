28
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm it's the wizard that gives them his

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,200

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,880

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:09,540
[Applause]

39
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:46,840

00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,419
okay so going through it here my first

42
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,109
impressions yes it is so good to see not

43
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:08,200
only color but jokes the fun of a nobody

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,590
there is this is literally can't be a

45
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,840
better time for Shazam

46
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,630
because Shazam could be the savior of

47
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,549
the DC Universe Wonder Woman gave you a

48
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,620
hands that oh this could be good maybe

49
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,380
we'll see what's that trailer but for

50
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,199
Shazam Joe I'm really excited okay so we

51
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,199
start off with the story of you know him

52
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,620
being a little kid going into a new city

53
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,940
you know it's difficult making friends

54
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,680
he finds this guy who seems like an

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,169
asshole friend at least maybe they're

56
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,940
just giving each other shit you know

57
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,530
what I'm saying just like like friends

58
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,340
do alright so he's getting bullied in

59
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,320
school obviously his friends really into

60
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,409
superheroes okay so look at this that's

61
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:02,979
Henry Cavill I think I can see it Joe I

62
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,440
saw that's why I got so excited I saw

63
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,550
this image right here and I was like

64
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,370
okay if he makes a cameo I and in this

65
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,770
bright happy movie it's gonna be the

66
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,690
Superman that I saw as a kid

67
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,270
we're all Billy you know Batson looking

68
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,060
up to Superman it's his idol Joe and I'm

69
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,190
really hoping that this Billy find

70
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,080
Superman as an idol but I'm already

71
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,210
seeing that maybe not because it doesn't

72
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,280
look like he's into superheroes and it

73
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,570
looks like his friend is the one that's

74
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,250
into superheroes and that's a story

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,540
device I'll come to you immediately

76
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,830
because you're the one that knows gonna

77
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,020
be reading that that fucking shit where

78
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,940
the hell was Clark Kent on that one is

79
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,850
that Gotham see Gotham is more friendly

80
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,040
to Superman a certificate of

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,440
authenticity I don't know it's a bullet

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
probably that soup that stopped him so

83
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,210
his friend is really in assume and guys

84
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,430
I can't gushing right now because if

85
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,110
Superman appears in this film tonight

86
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,460
attack it will definitely raise the film

87
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,500
by probably at least a point and that's

88
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,550
good that's because that to me that

89
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,290
tells me they understand the character

90
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,750
of Billy Batson they understand Shazam

91
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,580
and they understand the direction that

92
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,990
they need to go they need to make

93
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,150
superheroes fun again superheroes are

94
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:34,880
not fun in the DC Universe Brian what is

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,250
it Batman tries to go over to the Marvel

96
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,080
Universe look it up it's very funny so

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,820
of course you got the classic bully

98
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,010
thing you know what this never gets old

99
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,010
to me as long as it's done well because

100
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,080
it's just justice it's I love watching

101
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,260
justice reddit posts and stuff so we'll

102
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,870
see he stands up for himself he doesn't

103
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,180
have any superhero powers he run he's

104
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,480
running away and that's when you know he

105
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,390
escapes and the wizard selects him so

106
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm very interested in what he does in

107
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,190
the movie to be selected as such a good

108
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,530
heart and you know what he does it to

109
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,050
get the Wizards attention so if you

110
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,240
don't know Joe this story this the the

111
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,890
wizard that bestows the power of Shazam

112
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,800
on him or Captain Marvel I don't know

113
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,830
what it's Shazam now because that's mmm

114
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,600
they took the name Captain Marvel over

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,720
there at Marvel but um he has given the

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,810
power to another before a long time ago

117
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,460
as you could see he's old

118
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,470
he's looking for a new person and guess

119
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,509
who that old person was that he gave the

120
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:45,289
power to previously Black Adam oh yes so

121
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,270
he's actually a Shazam type of power

122
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,180
right but he went bad and so that's who

123
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,330
the rock is the Dwayne Johnson so where

124
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,370
you know he know it's confirmed

125
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,550
black Adams not in this film but maybe

126
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,229
they're just saying that he's not the

127
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,940
villain we know that we already saw the

128
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,550
villain dr. dr. Shazam Sourcefire I

129
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,500
don't know what his name the bald guy

130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,240
and but maybe I'm hoping for an end clip

131
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,090
teaser you know like at the end of the

132
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,710
credits cuz that doesn't count as the

133
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,780
film so maybe they were like we're not

134
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,300
coming that would be so cool to see the

135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,820
rock like maybe turn around do his eye

136
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,570
thing or something yeah the people's

137
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,060
eyebrow in that so okay what do you

138
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:37,000
think about the suit Joe yes I love

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,870
everything about it

140
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,039
I literally love everything about it but

141
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,410
one single thing and you know what the

142
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,980
one single thing is the LED light in his

143
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,170
light his lightning bolt the Shazam

144
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,839
symbol I think it's a little too cheesy

145
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,110
it's a little too on the nose

146
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,540
it's but let's let me just say they're

147
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,180
getting closer and closer like Marvel is

148
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,100
just like little kind of update I'm

149
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,839
happy there's fun look at all this red

150
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,430
Joe White you can't get around gold

151
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,070
white yellow that's it all is bright so

152
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,470
I'm so happy Shazam is bringing the

153
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,260
lightness into DC so I am worried

154
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,120
because none of these jokes made me

155
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,640
laugh out loud kind of thing because I

156
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,940
I've read a lot of Shazam and I've seen

157
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,620
a lot of the cartoons I'm already in

158
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,779
love with the character and he's kind of

159
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,880
like that good old boy boy scout kind of

160
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,670
thing even more so than Superman but he

161
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,709
has that innocent boy charm to him and I

162
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,540
think we're gonna get a little bit more

163
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,970
modern tank to the valley Billy Batson

164
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,350
side because he's a

165
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,910
millennial no he's not even a millennial

166
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,940
he's that what's the generations iPad

167
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,490
generation I guess these kids coming up

168
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,260
the backpack kid generation right that

169
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,450
is gonna be so funny the juxta dition

170
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,790
it's basically what's that movie with

171
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,280
Tom Hanks Joe you remember that big oh

172
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,240
my god

173
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,550
this is gonna be big and I freaking love

174
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:19,779
that movie

175
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,089
test test okay I'm just making sure they

176
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,500
can hear you Joe okay

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,600
you see I can't hear you that's weird I

178
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,190
saw things going up alright anyways I

179
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:38,540
think but but hopefully Billy still

180
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,990
knows about Superman as I read it but it

181
00:10:44,990 --> 00:11:00,290
doesn't hurt him laugh out loud moments

182
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,450
already in the trailer I just don't want

183
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:10,100
them to ruin anymore now he's doing

184
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,899
little things for it okay so I have no

185
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,180
idea how the hell I know

186
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,779
no no member and he actually doesn't do

187
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:27,579
you remember in the Kingsmen almost

188
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,030
anyway

189
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,480
[Music]

190
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,120
so so you know I've been all positive

191
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,350
about this thing this whole time but so

192
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,019
the transformation shazam transformation

193
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,620
is very very important for some reason

194
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,420
this transformation lacked a little bit

195
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,819
of impact for me do you like this

196
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,910
transformation I think it's good yeah

197
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,019
that's good it's a way I did maybe

198
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,790
there's just too much smoke or I don't

199
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,040
buy the smoke effect it just doesn't I

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,819
need it wasn't as powerful as I'd like

201
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:09,430
struck I think yeah the the lightning

202
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,290
bolt needs to maybe be bigger or

203
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,600
something and and you see how it's like

204
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
a little tiny thing and then there's

205
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,759
just smoke

206
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,160
so when Shazam in the comics it's all

207
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,350
about the lightning and in here it looks

208
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,540
more like it's about the smoke so we'll

209
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,339
see I'm sure he has plenty of Shazam

210
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,680
transformations and I'm guarantee

211
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,509
there's the same where the bad guy was

212
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,490
this you know because they can't fucking

213
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,589
transform he's a little kid and they

214
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,389
start beating up a little kid so we'll

215
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,680
get an r-rated Shazam it'll be all

216
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,819
cotton candy and and gumballs until they

217
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:47,680
prevent him from and then you will

218
00:12:47,680 --> 00:13:02,970
literally see a brutalization of

219
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,459
backpack kid dads Joe I can't tell you

220
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,529
how many kids I see practicing their

221
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,939
back just randomly when they're waiting

222
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,980
in line with their parents and I saw

223
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,680
this video online of just like a concert

224
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,899
for little kids and all of the kids were

225
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:23,819
in synchronized they were doing yeah man

226
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,930
I don't know if do you think he's

227
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,389
packing they're packing some some some

228
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:31,089
you know suit muscles in there cuz damn

229
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,490
but he looks good it looks appropriate

230
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,160
and he looks as strong and as big as

231
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,879
Superman

232
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,629
so please DC please let there be a

233
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:43,899
Superman cameo but you know what even if

234
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,170
there isn't this trailer has got me

235
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,279
really excited forces Shazam and

236
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,180
honestly he's one of the most cheesiest

237
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,320
characters and one that I think would be

238
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,329
so hard to get right in a live-action

239
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,579
there has been attempts before like a

240
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:02,320
television series I think or a breeze

241
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:11,680
yeah it's the sixties yeah so definitely

242
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,589
check out the DC animation Superman of

243
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:17,529
Shazam and verse black Adam and that's a

244
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,990
battle with Superman and Shazam and that

245
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,910
nails it and I want to see that on

246
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,459
screen for Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam

247
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,079
film which I think they said sometime in

248
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,589
2020 so so I want you Sam to do well

249
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:31,300
because if she dance Shazam doesn't do

250
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,250
well then maybe we Nitin might not see

251
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,800
Black Adam so everybody go out and see

252
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,320
this thing because we're all set to it

253
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,730
so we shall see we'll keep you posted

254
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,040
all right guys that's our opinion on

255
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,889
Shazam are you as excited on us this one

256
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,800

257
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,930
meter Joe like hyped and then what this

258
