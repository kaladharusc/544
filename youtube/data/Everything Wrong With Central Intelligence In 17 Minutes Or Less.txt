1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,710
a minute and two goddamn seconds of King

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,750
logos Comcast someone who went to high

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,860
school roughly at the same time this

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,389
flashback opening is taking place in

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,369
this is the nicest cool boys locker room

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,020
in the history of 20 years ago schools

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,730
movie thinks asses aren't physically

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,320
funny also there's no way somebody this

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,029
unpopular dances around school showers

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,199
like this especially not at the

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,490
beginning of the school day when any

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,380
asshole can walk in in a soldier's ah be

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
rid of showers you're in first period

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,800
bully keeps tabs on Robbie showering

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,780
habits please it right there can I get

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,280
an arrow on that sign yeah that one in

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,480
the back left that is literally the

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,730
worst pep rally sign ever geez first my

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,110
lovin you're never going to get it and

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,059
now unbelievable they said this was 20

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,350
years ago the beginning of this thing

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,940
both of those songs are from the early

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,280
90s and not 1996 where we'd be hearing

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,410
more Macarena and come on right at the

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,059
train hell I'd even settle for some

26
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,949
ironic if you got it sorry no student

27
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,329
body anywhere loves a popular student

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,280
this universally it's called high school

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,689
everyone hates each other the bullies

30
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,040
said that Bob always showers during

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,689
first period as if everyone in the

32
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,460
school was in first period at the time

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,650
and not at an assembly and what kind of

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,119
assembly takes place around the time of

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,350
first period instead of at the end of

36
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,210
the day also how terrible is a principal

37
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,470
that these bullies think they can just

38
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,060
drag someone from the showers into the

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,009
gym naked and expect no reprisals for it

40
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,810
what bullies would get this hands-on

41
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,909
with a fat naked guy they hate and how

42
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,860
far does a naked guy slide on gym floor

43
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,079
like zero right everybody here finds

44
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,759
this hilarious when you'd probably get

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,590
three nervous chuckles tops and the rest

46
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,700
of the assembly would just be in an

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,740
uproar this couldn't be less funny well

48
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,240
the pig's blood and Carey was probably

49
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,439
funnier than this and it only got a

50
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,299
couple bit chica Faust well there's no

51
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,860
coming back from that I guess we should

52
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,090
find this terrible principal who doesn't

53
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,740
give it all arias because of his doesn't

54
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,210
give it yes but considering the cruelty

55
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,259
of the gag it plays like they're

56
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,030
laughing at sanctioned abuse yeah seems

57
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,170
right the guy who won all those

58
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,700
accolades and was a star athlete and

59
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,290
academic is in a dead-end job in an

60
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,240
office story why shouldn't that mean he

61
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,320
was a dick at the beginning of the movie

62
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,270
the guy was super nice and smart and

63
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,770
athletic I mean this dude couldn't cash

64
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,229
that in hey check it it is apparently

65
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,820
required in comedies these days for the

66
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,170
character to work at an office where he

67
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,879
shares space with some smarmy asshole

68
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,340
senior o'houlihan I guess that's funny

69
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,629
he can go to lunch with coworkers

70
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,710
because he was taking a

71
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,180
way to lunch but somehow they were going

72
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,740
to the same restaurant so he gets the

73
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,960
whiff it yeah okay in my life down here

74
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,470
became a disappointment that's wrong be

75
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,670
this guy in the movie says has been with

76
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,200
this girl for 20 years describes his

77
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,730
life as a disappointment then act

78
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,380
surprised when she gets angry this is a

79
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,940
movie husband a real world husband knows

80
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,720
better than this

81
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,890
Calvin react to this is if he hears the

82
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,480
movie sound effects thinks it's totally

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,100
weird that the phone rang right after he

84
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,870
clicked confirm instead of not noticing

85
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,220
anything weird like everyone else

86
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,710
uh-huh black people don't go therapy go

87
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,240
to barber shops that's when we talk on a

88
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,400
problem we watched a movie barbershop

89
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,900
sure let's just reinforce stereotypes

90
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
about race for all the funnies watching

91
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,280
pop things people don't ever say when

92
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,030
running into somebody on the sidewalk

93
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,050
comedic overreaction is such an

94
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,670
overreaction it forgets the comedic part

95
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,440
it's 60m and there in the eastern time

96
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,550
zone so there's no way there's a

97
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,900
football game on unless this bar are

98
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,490
showing reruns because the NFL never

99
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,440
plays games that start at 6 p.m. Eastern

100
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,540
you know Mike Herculean survival or road

101
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,000
block or the Scorpion King just one okay

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,090
Bobby's in a while remember this this

103
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,580
was the very jab did no music exist in

104
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,530
1996 this movie revolves completely

105
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,270
around early 90s hits as if the music

106
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,980
industry declared a freeze on new music

107
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,280
after 1992 blow away he ate sir somebody

108
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,560
actually said yes someone was now dammit

109
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,300
look I don't doubt these assholes exist

110
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,220
but this is bull a dude that is this

111
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,350
ridiculously rude just in time to get

112
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,700
his ass kicked by the rock is what I

113
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,230
call a convenient asshole just letting

114
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,790
everyone know this is over a stolen

115
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,740
chair at a bar it's not the conflict we

116
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,450
wanted but apparently need it you like

117
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,040
Jason Bourne amber would George

118
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,020
hilariously that sense was literally the

119
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,270
pitch for American ultra hey I got an

120
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,720
idea

121
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,100
let's roll here's my bike there were

122
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,540
absolutely zero helmets in the vicinity

123
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,430
but when they drive off Bob not only got

124
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,870
one on but he's got a spare for Calvin

125
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,490
also both of these men are forgetting

126
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,810
the beers and shot this guy just drank

127
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,280
and I thought high school was going to

128
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,350
be like like sixteen Candles you'll see

129
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,370
that movie on blacks on

130
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,319
this is the second time black people

131
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,670
don't do that it's supposed to be funny

132
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,170
and I'm gonna count it I just thought I

133
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,450
was meant for more you know guy doesn't

134
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,590
see that marrying the most beautiful

135
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,209
woman ever isn't a great life cliche I

136
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,340
don't know I just did it man exactly

137
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,290
so do it now Bob once Calvin to do the

138
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,519
backflip he used to do in high school

139
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,900
and if this doesn't end up being a

140
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,310
hilariously painful situation I'll

141
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,930
remove five sins otherwise I'm going to

142
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,870
add five angle I man wait a minute is

143
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,160
this movie telling me that Calvin is an

144
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,419
expert hacker who can get into this

145
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,340
illegal offshore account site or is the

146
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,449
movie telling you that Bob gave him the

147
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:35,889
password and Calvin is the type of guy

148
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,630
who would say bingo and then after an

149
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,370
ordinary password entry because either

150
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,950
way it's simply hour and 47 minute movie

151
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,660
about a CIA guy goes the first 30

152
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,460
minutes not CIA and feeling more like

153
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,750
Romy and Michele's Grosse Pointe blank

154
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,690
hey sex with a jet jet those are

155
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,430
obviously hilariously undersized for Bob

156
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,110
but they would also have to be

157
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,970
ridiculously oversized for Calvin to fit

158
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,470
it so I'm calling bull on your sight gag

159
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,120
movie I can't believe I'm having a

160
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,530
sleepover at Calvin Jordan's house right

161
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,389
oh I'm surprised as a couch hide-a-bed

162
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,949
made that can tolerate the rocks weight

163
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,510
and frame without bending or collapsing

164
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm being serious TBS pretty much plays

165
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,530

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,240
had any contact with this man the CIA is

175
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,530
only here because they know for a fact

176
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,479
bob was talking to Calvin or trace that

177
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,130
computer hack here or any number of

178
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,960
things the CIA could know so why are

179
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,130
they bothering with a simple knock I

180
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,150
don't why don't they have other CIA

181
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,470
people around the house to make sure Bob

182
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,139
can't escape come off I'm pressing the

183
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,490
timeout but it's the button that you

184
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,630
press when you're overacting and you

185
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,180
need to cheat laughs let's see some

186
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,080
today

187
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,650
oh this apparently hasn't ever happened

188
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,630
to this dude at work before scare well

189
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,550
everything agent goes toward the stairs

190
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,169
leaving the entire floor open my

191
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,330
favorite as long as mops in the building

192
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,560
no one's safe that's why we brought

193
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,940
three whole agents to track and bounce

194
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,440
definitely isn't behind the door here

195
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,639
but is suddenly behind the door here

196
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,530
Plus where is he hiding to make a phone

197
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,940
call and be in the office at the same

198
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,229
time suddenly there are three other

199
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,760
agents I don't know where because even

200
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,050
the movie realized how stupid sending

201
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,810
just three agents with this guy was yeah

202
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,280
hang tight everyone Kevin Hart's going

203
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,479
to give the play-by-play of what's

204
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,039
happening in this scene you know for

205
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:12,430
hilari

206
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,560
holy where were these guys I guess they

207
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
were in the middle of their customary

208
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,110
smoke break also all of the

209
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,940
guys miss the CIA conveniently doesn't

210
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,530
have anybody directly behind Bob which

211
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,360
means that's where he's escaping and

212
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,010
three two one I guarantee you it's

213
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,330
impossible to know the exact number of

214
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,890
seconds the next I will take to burn up

215
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,690
to the sprinkler also and perhaps more

216
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,070
importantly that sprinkler system is

217
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,300
perfect since it should have gone off

218
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
almost as soon as the tie fire started

219
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,480
and shouldn't have dated actual flames

220
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,280
to reach it before going on also also

221
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,200
that tie took four minutes to burn all

222
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,760
the way up to the top also also also

223
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,130
somehow the CIA is ported by water

224
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,720
luckily the standoff occurred right in

225
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,100
the spot where these two could jump out

226
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,420
of a window and directly onto the

227
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,310
inflatable gorilla outside also despite

228
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,500
having 437 agents on the top floor

229
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,300
nobody's down here just in case Bob

230
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,340
escape all these gunshots and none hit

231
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,380
Bob or Calvin or the tires hey what's

232
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,060
this honey okay guys this is where I

233
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,770
check out of the movie in character was

234
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,360
never funny now he's making me go search

235
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,470
for the manager of this theater and

236
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,180
demand double refund passes and I need

237
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,040
your super sweet accounting skills why

238
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,990
even if you've had to go rogue to catch

239
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,910
the real bad guy how does a badass agent

240
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,620
like you not have any contacts around

241
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,030
the world with accounting skills bob's

242
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,380
murdered partner is being played by

243
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,880
aaron paul which almost certainly means

244
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,290
he was not murdered and he's the actual

245
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,360
bad guy also enough does this murder get

246
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,430
pinned on Bob oh yeah Bob murdered his

247
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,840
partner with a stick him in the elevator

248
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,830
and blow him up technique classic

249
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,510
motorcycle guy is storm trooper terrible

250
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,370
of aiming Jesus toddler with an Uzi

251
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,810
would be more accurate than this Curt

252
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,430
also how does this guy know they're here

253
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,380
okay maybe the GPS but didn't bob

254
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,040
disconnected

255
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,720
and if he disconnected it why did he

256
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,860
think it was a good idea to stay here

257
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,180
when this is the first place the CIA

258
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,770
might look if they ever figured out what

259
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,450
GPS to look for instead of just shooting

260
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,950
Bob right now this guy would rather do a

261
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,270
bunch of motorcycle karate on him

262
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,250
guaranteeing he will not succeed no no

263
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,860
don't go home oh okay so you're not

264
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,630
going home right I spend so much time

265
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,580
asking his wife not to go home shocked

266
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,480
she doesn't go straight home I swear to

267
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,980
god 23 percent of this movie is Kevin

268
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,720
Hart making faces and noises and unfun

269
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,430
aliy riffing Kevin Hart is now the male

270
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,170
Melissa McCarthy really funny person

271
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,460
that gets less funny the more the

272
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,530
director allows him to riff okay I am

273
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,590
scared okay I don't have motion in my

274
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,660
system if I say it down on told it

275
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
nothing's coming out farts are just air

276
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,470
I'm confused

277
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,240
should I hope that mr. Hart got paid a

278
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,010
lot of money to say these lines or

279
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,360
should I hope he didn't get paid a lot

280
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,890
of money to say this lines either way

281
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,449
somebody got robbed

282
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,669
test with a ghost figment of his

283
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,349
imagination he started calling the black

284
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,659
badger interesting since 20 seconds

285
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,969
later agent Pamela says this Bob stone

286
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,669
is the black badger how could the black

287
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,620
badger be made up real at the same time

288
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,050
he killed him to cover his tracks

289
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,490
Jesus you figured that out in three

290
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,899
weeks a you conducted an investigation

291
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,579
that led you to believe Bob did this

292
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:50,470
even though there are way easier methods

293
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,579
to kill a guy and make it look like an

294
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,589
accident you're the only one Bob trusts

295
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:55,690
through some reason how you babe Calvin

296
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,940
this is dr. Dan even more total nonsense

297
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,529
because now even if Calvin told his wife

298
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,149
about Bob sleeping downstairs and she

299
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,529
was okay with it now I'm supposed to

300
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,970
believe that she saw him downstairs this

301
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,170
morning and didn't make a connection

302
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,519
when it turned out their therapist was

303
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,370
the same guy how could you hit your wife

304
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,050
this whole therapy session made it into

305
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,459
the movie somehow it could have made the

306
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,750
decision not to have it in there but

307
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,829
somebody decided to keep it

308
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,089
and only a certified international

309
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,949
banking official can accent its Trevor

310
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,660
you moving your bolts on because you

311
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,980
want to know what they're gonna vote on

312
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,720
homecoming king and queen again maybe

313
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,310
you'll Maggie can make it two for two by

314
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,870
the way these guys have a ten-year high

315
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,310
school reunion that's the one most

316
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,630
people go to right could they forget

317
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,060
that the Oscar goes to

318
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,060
clever oh wait he was cooking with them

319
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,380
if the rock doesn't break this guy's

320
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,670
fine before the scene is over I'm gonna

321
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,420
be offended once if that kid always at

322
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,339
that kid if that were the case then Bob

323
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,720
would have trouble beating up bullies no

324
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,220
matter what because they would remind

325
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,540
him of the pain from high school but

326
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,160
because it actually happens to be Trevor

327
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,660
of all people he suddenly freezes up

328
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,310
unnecessarily sidetracking this movie

329
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,019
and meaning Trevor's ass beating will

330
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,399
have to occur at the Reunion because

331
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,139
that's how these movies do Suzy tries to

332
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,880
have heart after a full hour of the

333
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,290
exact opposite of heart even though

334
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,060
technically it's been at least 60% heart

335
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,709
not is so affected by the old bully

336
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,329
reviving the high school bully memories

337
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:12,040
he leaves Calvin behind even though he

338
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,540
needs Calvin to mathematical brain to

339
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,329
complete his mission thanks for sharing

340
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,610
I mean if it's undisclosed do I really

341
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,199
benefit from learning that look at the

342
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,639
torture room got it location is

343
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,910
unimportant control if you want to

344
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,319
stomach for even though why'd you even

345
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,579
let this tool into the interrogation

346
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,410
chamber in the first place he's a pawn

347
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,240
you used to get to Bob you don't need

348
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,709
him and he hasn't earned any right to

349
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,220
watch interrogation he can

350
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,870
when agent Harris says you can leave

351
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,399
that's why I'm leaving you in the Sun

352
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,170
locker room with no guards who among us

353
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,790
hasn't seen a banana and instant we

354
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,149
decided to escape this works also

355
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,220
bananas traction I really am sorry this

356
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,079
clock in the background says it's 441 I

357
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,759
really am because the clock in the next

358
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,829
room says it's 741 I really didn't want

359
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,240
to notice this or give it a sin but

360
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,279
there it is so Bob and Calvin try to be

361
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,540
best buds again just outside the

362
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,459
interrogation room and not only do they

363
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,959
have time for that way once again

364
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,250
somehow managed to get in a situation

365
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,050
where the three main agents are the only

366
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,730
agents until they've action demands more

367
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,079
give you a dollar if you can decipher

368
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,579
what the fuck is going on in this action

369
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,019
sequence Calvin don't learn by osmosis

370
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,819
or something to be able to do that nope

371
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,379
you can't toss a guy ten feet into

372
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,490
concrete and have this kind of wall

373
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,589
exploding reaction concision the first

374
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,949
what this is gonna hurt Wow Calvin had

375
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:22,360
that one-liner timed out perfectly

376
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,680
somehow those agents don't know that and

377
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,269
don't shoot at the tires look at this

378
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,600
vibrate on that whoa what look if you're

379
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,129
gonna steal the pulp fiction line do it

380
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,139
right don't put a dull in front of jet

381
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,040
you made it weird

382
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,199

383
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,569
Google that's not only Google racist but

384

394

jackass second largest penis hunt in

395
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,860
history what was the largest penis hunt

396
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,050
in state history Fassbender Emsworth Oh

397
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,180
art not Korean so you better believe it

398
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,680
took a long time in fact I'm just gonna

399
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,269
let Kumail take this you're stereotyping

400
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,089
Korean dicks that's racist yeah and I'm

401
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,889
adding 50 Cent's Plus Kumail Nanjiani

402
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:15,170
would be amazing at citizen mod and

403
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,339
Calvin are able to take off from this

404
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:17,750
runway without anyone noticing and

405
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,069
apparently don't show up on military

406
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,660
radar on the Atlantic coast Plus

407
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,430
completely out of gas I know for a fact

408
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,050
this is bull before I even get to the

409
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,430
part where they show that Bob is faking

410
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,959
this whole thing that's how movies like

411
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,430
these are the setup is too obvious

412
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,720
you're wasting our time well these feels

413
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,490
a scene from San Andreas because let's

414
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,899
be honest who the remembers anything

415
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,490
about that movie I like it you attention

416
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,430
make bird call oh oh man I got a hand up

417
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,930
to Kevin Hart he's actually blasting

418
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,889
through these horrible audience

419
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,540
pandering scenarios with full force and

420
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,570
no embarrassment fun

421
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,460
I can't make bird noises I never could

422
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,620
that's your biggest weakness not fear of

423
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,810
heights or addiction or daddy issues and

424
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,100
the rock is getting off an elevator with

425
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,390
a gun and you can't tell what movie or

426
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,130
film franchise it's from that's a sign

427
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,450
the film you're watching is a beautiful

428
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,620
hilarious and while I understand this is

429
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,420
a comedy if Bob had told Calvin

430
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,070
basically anything along the way this

431
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,540
wouldn't seem like such a random finale

432
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,920
do it

433
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,590
go ahead I won't you want to bet Harris

434
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,050
is not the Blackmagic American a mistake

435
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,090
aa sudden there Oh Who am I kidding I'm

436
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,080
not surprised like anything in this

437
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,830
movie I am the black batcher you may not

438
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,940
have heard it but Calvin apparently

439
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,770
recognizes that Aaron Paul is Phil how

440
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,540
the does Calvin know that did he see a

441
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,190
picture of him all he's heard is a story

442
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,690
Bob told it and another story agent

443
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,360
Harris told I am the black batcher

444
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
no I'm the black badger I really don't

445
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,710
give it through the black banner in so

446
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,630
long as we can end it soon when this

447
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,010
thing's over I'm going to rip your

448
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,740
throat out my Patrick Swayze Roadhouse

449
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,240
movie continues it's out of date

450
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,040
references for the benefit of someone

451
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,060
also Roadhouse sucks there I said it the

452
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,400
CIA once again brings three people also

453
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,290
three CIA bitches appear and fire guns

454
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,850
and even though the bad guys had like 25

455
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,140
men on their side this will somehow

456
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,850
devolve into an even battle Calvin

457
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,200
Joyner went to the previous school of

458
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,910
running away from things instead of ever

459
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,230
turning Calvin counted on the

460
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,450
uncountable SUV X marketer to save his

461
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,490
ass thank heavens Bob somehow timed this

462
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,530
don't seriously believe this guy do I

463
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,630
get behind me jet movie tries to make me

464
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,040
doubt the rock is the good guy at the

465
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,210
last minute which isn't gonna work

466
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,160
because this moves towards the rock duh

467
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,530
nobody hits nothing here normal everyday

468
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,390
foot and fist fight requires an edit for

469
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,890
every blow landed also fight

470
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,540
choreography brought to you by who gives

471
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,700
up since the camerawork is so shaky nice

472
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,730
no that's at this point I'm just waiting

473
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,260
for this to turn into anchorman 3 and we

474
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,910
suddenly see the Terminator Bart Simpson

475
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,440
Dirty Harry Michael Corleone and

476
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,700
everyone else who's ever had a thing

477
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,440
show up on screen Andrew the face well

478
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,780
know why your pal Bob could never been

479
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,610
the black badger it's because he's too

480
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,530
riche villain overexposed it's and

481
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,030
creates a window for the hero you know

482
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,420
faking my own death was the easy part

483
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,880
Jesus stop talking I mean seriously what

484
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,770
is the point this is so insulting I'm

485
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,330
getting away with a half a billion

486
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,030
dollars boy scout bob is going to spend

487
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,130
his life in prison so I guess it makes

488
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,930
sense that Bob would fall for this but

489
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,790
anyone else in the CIA - with a Blood

490
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,500
Pact like this show up is not your blood

491
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,750
at all but ink or someone else's blood

492

that he learned this marriage lesson he

504

thing Robbie may be good how can someone

517
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,120
have this much of a bully boner for real

518
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,950
like legitimately I don't even feel

519
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,570
great that Bob finally punches this guy

520
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,550
it's like thirty eight-year-old people

521
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,529
where's the boy in that twenty years ago

522

524
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,970
way too hard to have a feel good morally

525
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,230
positive ending and it's lame as shock

526
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,840
yeah sad to say but the funniest thing

527
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,310
in this movie is that guy celebrating

528
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,320
catching Bob's pants you fell II don't

529

Looby is trying to kamikaze all the

531
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,980
happy endings that can fit into the last

532
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,230

536
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,700
he ever put on any Underpants

537
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,050
I mean is he still hanging out there

538
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,820
like the swing ride at a County Fair so

539
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,530
now that she's pregnant are we supposed

540
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,120
to believe that for 20 years this was

541
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,710
never a problem for Milly feels like

542
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,940
this couple we've gotten divorced about

543
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,620
15 years ago if that were the case as I

544
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,050
close this movie is still going even

545
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,490

546
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:56,030
sleep in it most nights no you don't

547
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,030

548

549
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:17,170
[Applause]

550

I'm bata got today I took my first crap

557
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,630
in two weeks hey if you can't be adults

558
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,940
and give these candidates the courtesy

559
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,950
they deserve then you don't deserve to

560
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,650
be called adults by children because

561
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,060
that's what children are and you'll be

562
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,490
treated like children you don't know

563
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,780
about them because if they were to come

564
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,000
into use they put the oil companies out

565
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,750
of business

566
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,790
the concept of the internal combustion

567
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,770
engine has been obsolete for over 50

568
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,470
years but because of the oil cartels and

569
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,630
corrupt government regulation we in the

570
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,100
rest of the world is forced to use

571
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,000
gasoline for over 100 years
