into flames but that was that was it

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,540

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,499

00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,440
were numerous numerous subplots you've

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,679
got sort of glitches or let's start with

13
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,800
the beginning or what's up Betty

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,559

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,059
the animals right and so then he he

19
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,300
basically is doing his fantastic beasts

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,540
thing as he captures a dragon but later

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,729
on it feels like it's just being used

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,420
for the you know final thing Oh 100% and

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,479
that's exactly what it is we get a

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,070
little bit of who is precent what's his

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,149

oh no credence created credence who is

28
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,109
credence we don't know never know this

29
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,270
film is all about who is credence his

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,090
motive a he's very powerful he died in

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,869
the first world

32
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,840
I don't supposedly and so he lives

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,539
through magic he's yeah he's still alive

34
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:03,469
how right so and he needs to figure out

35
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,689
where he comes from why it means that

36
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,920
much to him it's a contrivance why they

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
go through the records at the ministry

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,590
and they're trying to find out in the

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,300
library and lets them in and then later

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,610
on this librarian turns into the most

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,830
evil chick I've ever seen the most

42
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,620
intimidate

43
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,480
like she's straight-up bad guy more

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,870
scared of her than I am Johnny okay yeah

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,819
she lets loose crazy cats who will

46
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,530
fucking kill you that doesn't make any

47
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,049
sense magic like what the fuck

48
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:36,920
why'd she turn into such a bad guy and

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,569
yeah and then there's a subplot with

50
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,310
newts brother who is when they were kids

51
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,430
likes this girl that liked new too

52
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,349
because they had a connection because he

53
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,659
loves animals and she thinks he's cute

54
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,000
because he takes care of animals marries

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,769
the brother so she marries the brother

56
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,190
and then all supersu Daisy or does she

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,579
like him and then is he only there to

58
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,950
reclaim her but that's so muddy that it

59
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,500
doesn't doesn't come across like that

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,200
that subplot was broken and all over the

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,440
place in oopsie Daisy she dies why does

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,940
she wait so he so basically the story is

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,220
he breaks free you know I don't know why

64
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,840
they're transporting and there's no

65
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,409
reason for it yes serve his time in

66
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,109
Europe no clearly explain there he's

67
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,829
like most dangerous fucking wizard aside

68
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,889
from that's evil 101

69
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,810
you gotta transport them all Meijer I

70
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,269
mean one you have to transport them

71
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,340
breaks out and then essentially has a

72
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,959
rally like a fuckin rally you know and

73
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,239
and he's got these black banners that

74
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,620
they go across the city and that's

75
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,750
supposed to tell everybody be here at

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,030
the cemetery or something we can't email

77
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,060
them yet it's 1927 right so it's so

78
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,859
inconsistent with what Wizards can and

79
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,319
can't do you know they they make it seem

80
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,329
like wizards are so popular than all

81
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,069
these different spells but they look

82
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,709
like muggles when chaos is happening in

83
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,739
the streets and this fucking tiger

84
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,510
dragon animal gets loose and everybody

85
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,250
acts like they're not a wizard and

86
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,750
they're just getting crushed and moved

87
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,030
around and like idiots everybody would

88
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,800
look ok we're good and then as these

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,510
black banners are flying through the air

90
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,330
ominously everybody's you know still

91
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,120
talking walking his lady man

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,740
like nothing is fucking happening it's

93
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,900
like do you guys not give a shit the

94
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,700
black banners fly in the streets every

95
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,130
fucking day cover all the buildings what

96
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,210
they thought it was an ad yeah yeah oh

97
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,940
it's just really inconsistent and

98
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,130
finally gets this rally together creates

99
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,550
this blue circle of flames and this shit

100
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,470
is so fucking powerful it's like why

101
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,270
don't you use this thing you'll never

102
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,970
use this any other time like you summon

103
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,800
blue flame dragons that are killing

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,020
everybody right and then he's just like

105
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,520
stupefying people earlier it's like no

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,740
do the blue dragon thing cuz that's cool

107
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,440
yeah and but they say before the climax

108
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,150
of the film like yeah well there wasn't

109
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,700
much of a climax of the climax of the

110
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,950
film was to CGI a dragon's fighting each

111
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,590
other one note one CGI dragon lighting

112
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,930
wire yeah they encase it in fire and

113
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,940
then it goes away blue fire and orange

114
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,970
fire and the ministry coming to shut

115
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,790
down or I guess supposedly arrest

116
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,430
everybody in that rally even though they

117
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,180
only brought 40 agents to contain 300

118
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,980
Wizards that doesn't make any fucking

119
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,460
sense and then they start getting killed

120
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,860
by the blue flames and it make it snow

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,350
it's not consistent you've got guys with

122
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,110
wants creating shields the only

123
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,150
characters to create a shield or any

124
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,190
named characters that had a scene in the

125
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,710
film are they're the ones that just get

126
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,630
hit by the blue flames as if they never

127
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,910
knew how to use a one these are trained

128
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,640
enforcers knowing they're going into a

129
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,180
kind of a shady situation in the fucking

130
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,640
get evaporate they skip Defense Against

131
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,940
the Dark Arts to fucking yes you get

132
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,990
burned about by blue flame it feels like

133
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,310
Hogwarts is relatively new in this

134
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,930
universe they can't go to hollow it's

135
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,000
not it's well they definitely did for a

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,640
while alright well that's it just feels

137
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,970
like that but so yeah and I don't know

138
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,680
it just feels like damn man a lot of

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,990
coincidences a lot of contrived ensues

140
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,690
and don't say that lightly yeah there's

141
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,130
just a lot of parts we mentioned a

142
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,590
little bit before but the story that

143
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,050
they have to tell you what happens in

144
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,030
this story there there are scenes where

145
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,569
we

146
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:49,889
we're all sitting here in the theater

147
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,689
and going we don't know what the hell is

148
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,879
happening like no care about and then

149
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,110
there's a scene where Johnny Depp is

150
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,119
talking to some random flunky and he

151
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,550
explains the entire first part the last

152
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,839
hour to the flunky

153
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,429
and then says I'm gonna kill you later

154
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:04,199
and then he kills a miner well it's

155
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,319
because that guy said the great Dumbo

156
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,219
I mean Dumbledore and so he don't he's

157
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,289
like oh you should grow alright I'm

158
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:14,369
Katie later mm-hmm

159
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,169
it kills him later because he tries to

160
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,639
enter the blue circle where everybody's

161
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,949
evaporating flying up spreading the war

162
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,369

166
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,169
beasts of burden that's what he says

167
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,709
kill them

168
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,300
yeah like that four-year-old at the

169
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,589
beginning of the film he didn't kill

170
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,899
heating kill gave the order so he knows

171
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,519
better that's why he's better than

172
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,899
Baltimore because he knows the give thee

173
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,550
if you're gonna kill a kid like you give

174
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,759
the order someone else to do it just

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,929
when they kick comes back and it's gonna

176
00:07:51,929 --> 00:08:02,029
kill that bitch not him yes

177
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:04,319
so this film starts like that don't get

178
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,899
mad at me I didn't mean yeah I think

179
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,199
it's hilarious that Michael Myers Oh

180
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,180
Michael Myers won't kill a kid and but

181
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,329
this guy will kill kid what do you think

182
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,219
you think it's hilarious no I think it's

183
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,930
hilarious and Michael Myers will won't

184
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,990
kill a kid but these Wizards will and in

185
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,259
this film they'll do it yeah so what

186
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,529
else so essentially come on guys

187
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,319
the love triangles don't work out it's

188
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,959
bad then these two people who would have

189
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,539
really simple like relationship issues

190
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,729
that if one of them spoke to the other

191
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,289
one would be resolved like in ten

192
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,389
seconds don't for two hour about his

193
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,750
friend and Queenie no no the the main

194
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,360
Newt and what's her name she has she

195
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,569
thinks that he is engaged because the

196
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,550
newspaper printed that his brothers

197
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,410
inked like that his brothers feel simple

198
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,029
misunderstanding and as they also be

199
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,010
this let it go on for hours and it's

200
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,290
just so frustrating cuz it's so stupid

201
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,010
it's in Soul

202
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,890
the intelligence of your audience kids

203
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,840
are not we don't care and it's not for

204
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,060
kids that's for the adults parts of it

205
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,030
it's not for kids that part and it just

206
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,660
didn't work

207
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,660
okay so overall it turns out that this

208
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,110
love triangle force triangle between his

209
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,060
brother him and this one girl that they

210
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,120
knew in class is really just a way to

211
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,400
show that is credence related to her

212
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,340
well sort of but not really it turns out

213
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,400
that there's a fridge frenchmen wizard

214
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
who decided he didn't like his wife

215
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,110
anymore he wanted to shack up with this

216
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,610
other lady he's actually like he magic

217
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,370
raped a couple women hey my ajik

218
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,190
kidnapped her and raped her that's and

219
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,490
then that's the kid who is this one

220
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,640
character that shows up in the film like

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,860
he's gonna kill Creedence and he it's

222
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,930
his purpose because he wants to avenge

223
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,560
his family's honor his mother's honor by

224
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,850
killing Creedence but it's not really

225
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,490
that man's son because he wants to kill

226
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,770
the thing that that man terrible person

227
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,030
loves the most and is supposed to be

228
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,790
Creedence but it's not it turns out that

229
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,040
there was more baby murder before it was

230
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,260
even more baby murder in this film the

231
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,450
the sister who is leader leader leader

232
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,400
strange

233
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,590
Lestrange was sick and tired of hearing

234
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:41,610
her baby brother crying on a boat she

235
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,850
swaps babies for a little bit or maybe

236
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,140
forever

237
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,140
and it just so happens his boat I don't

238
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,090
know runs into an iceberg and it turns

239
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,230
into the Titanic I guess and that

240
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,090
they're on a different boat and that

241
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,120
that that baby dies he falls into the

242
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,730
water and dies in hurting a lot she

243
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,220
killed her brother because by mistaken

244
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,100
identity it gets put on a different boat

245
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,750
with that baby just so she can have some

246
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,770
peace and quiet

247
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,350
like I'm

248
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,360
goddamn so that's a that's a very sad

249
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,810
reveal I guess that was in the book

250
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,600
because it's it feels a little did you

251
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,260
read the 40 page pamphlet that I don't

252
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,870
know if there's that much baby murder in

253
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,590
fantasy

254
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,420
yeah they got they got they got the

255
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,400
mirror that you look into from the

256
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,520
original Harry Potter series to we'll

257
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,320
get into that in just a bit but they

258
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
also have the looking at the fear what

259
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
are those boggling but boggles and

260
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,360
stalkers Bogaerts or whatever where you

261
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,580
overcome your fears and you're like what

262
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,960
the hell is she scared of and it's

263
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,570
ominous everybody you know it lights up

264
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,370
the whole fucking room and it's this

265
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,680
white figure falling and you're not sure

266
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,760
what it is that's a dead baby yeah I

267
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,690
don't think that's a lot of weight and

268
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,130
they even try to put in the bully thing

269
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,810
in there like I can't wait to see what

270
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,590
she talks too much of my lips cuz she's

271
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,290
she's like a little troublemaker kid and

272
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,000
it's probably because she's got messed

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
up because she murdered about you

274
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,320
murdered a baby brother so anyway they

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,940
show off what she's most scared of this

276
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,260
dead baby drowning okay thanks for

277
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,150
watching guys Annika we did we did it it

278
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,500
goes to the next scene and she goes I

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,120
want to talk about it and then the film

280
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,520
just goes on so that was pretty crazy

281
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,370
but it you know and and then she dies

282
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,030
because she I guess attacks Chris what

283
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,740
was her plan there she was gonna be she

284
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,720
was gonna backstab gristle brand

285
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:55,690
Griswald yeah vacation yeah was around

286
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,700
yeah and I don't know what her plan was

287
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,380
she's just gonna shoot him most powerful

288
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,180
wizards that doesn't make any fucking

289
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,670
sense it's suicide I guess she should

290
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,010
join the fucking ministry in attacking

291
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,050
us in forces and they're right before

292
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,970
she dies she looks right at Newt who's

293
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,260
standing next to his brother but she's

294
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,640
looking at him and says I love you and

295
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,290
the brother says nothing like mentions

296
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,680
nothing well what it is is it's trying

297
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,300
to show you that you don't know who she

298
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,220
said I love you too it could have been

299
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,070
you know her husband to be or it could

300
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,850
have been nude

301
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,690
yeah it's implied that it was Newt yeah

302
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,500
but I I thought that was clever but

303
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,420
again I didn't care yeah I know I didn't

304
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,949
care because once we realized that

305
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,600
there's like this stupid blood pact

306
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,089
between gristle brand and okay so that's

307
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,290
what we're talking about when he looks

308
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,630
into the mirror he actually see and

309
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,370
you're wondering why the fuck doesn't

310
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,240
Dumbledore get off his dumb ass is he

311
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,130
the most powerful wizard and the wizard

312
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,079
is full and take him out well he's like

313
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,440
a can't anyway yeah but there's this

314
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,329
little trinket in the room the whole

315
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:03,310
time with like some liquid in it and

316
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,110
what is it so it's like they have a

317
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,579
Blood Pact and they were more than

318
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,110
brothers I think it's implied that they

319
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,389
were maybe love or lovers yeah from what

320
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:13,089
I understand and I read some controversy

321
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,269
that the first the Dumbledore is gay or

322
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,750
he's bi sec whatever he is gives a shit

323
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,730
who gives a shit but they wanted to keep

324
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,709
it out of the first film or they just

325
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,100
didn't show it and here the it they just

326
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,620
mention it with lip service they say we

327
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,029
were more than brothers well what does

328
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,589
that mean I don't fucking know what it

329
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,089
means it could mean whatever you want it

330
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,130
to me yeah so for people where gay

331
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,569
things are offensive it means that

332
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,220
they're just better than brothers and

333
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,069
best friends and I guess for you know

334
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:44,259
the other side is they would they were

335
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,639
gay lovers and he doesn't want to kill

336
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,589
his love well there's actually a spell

337
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,089
between them that says that they

338
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,589
literally cannot fight each other that's

339
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,420
what that little locket is so in this

340
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,120
movie Dumbledore has the best plot armor

341
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,759
ever he literally cannot die because the

342
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,380
only person that could fight him is

343
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,600
gristle brand and gross brain cannot

344
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,399
fight him back so Dumbledore could do

345
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,019
anything he wanted in this entire movie

346
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:09,790
but doesn't he sends Newt after he sends

347
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,399
a guy that can die against instead of

348
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,319
sending him just going himself he can't

349
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:16,269
go him so he can't use shit on him

350
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,800
that's the purpose of the was it me to

351
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,920
fight him he just needs to get the kid

352
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,630
he doesn't send Newt to kill gristle

353
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,550
Brande sins Newt to go get the kid save

354

371
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,910
social skills and he sends him with his

372
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,160
suitcase full of weird Pokemon and he's

373
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,510
like you're gonna go fight the most

374
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,620
powers that would make a better

375
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:22,720
adventure is eccentric guy yeah I

376
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,710
honestly I was jealous of all those

377
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,270
wizards in there because I was like man

378
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:31,430
be cool if I get cast I'm in the

379
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,170
universe even though none of those kids

380
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,060
are consequential they're gonna do jack

381
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,100
shit no you know they're gonna die yeah

382
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,810
well no I they don't interfere in World

383
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,730
War two that's the one thing I don't

384
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,340
know how did they fight that so the

385
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,580
Wizarding is did fight in World War one

386
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,500
secretly maybe there were Nazi wizards

387
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,190
also fighting and then they just did the

388
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,230
shit is kind of interesting and then I

389
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,670
wish they'd do someone there but that

390
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,680
they're staying far away from that yeah

391
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,390
and I don't even know if they're gonna

392
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,490
explain how they do anything during

393
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,370
World War two but anyways so any more

394
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,430
spoilers credence his new name

395
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,089
did I kind of finish my whole thing okay

396
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,280
so whatever you know I'm just going

397
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,980
around in circles so it turns out she

398
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,150
kills the wrong baby or she killed her

399
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,530
brother

400
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,380
and swapped the baby and saved the life

401
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,050
of this one baby and he is actually a

402
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,900
Dumbledore maybe I don't know Thor's

403
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,420
brother you learn this literally in the

404
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,640
last ten seconds of the film right the

405
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,230
very last thing you find out is that

406
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,300
credence is maybe Dumbledore's brother

407
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,930
or something maybe I guess I have no he

408
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,610
says you're a Dumbledore is she lying

409
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,210
what is this a fucking Star Wars

410
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,710
powerful with the last scene destroyed

411
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,149
destroyed the side of a mountain we

412
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,629
he didn't yell and spell he just goes

413
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:59,549
first time wielding a wand blew up a

414
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,489
mountain that's that's Dumbledore's

415
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,399
brother yes sir so that's why I got

416
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:07,619
excited guys I was like okay let with

417
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,479
you but then I'm like you told me

418
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,699
they got three more I was like oh it's

419
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:16,139
not gonna happen be a good fight okay so

420
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,389
now all the plot holes this this big

421
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,239
rich French guy who kidnaps other

422
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,309
people's wives and has sex with them and

423
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,739
then replaces them or that she dies

424
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,989
right and they just replace him with

425
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,669
another woman and they injected he

426
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,199
didn't love her either and he had sector

427
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:34,709
r2 like what this guy's a piece of shit

428
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:37,739
and but this whole thing wouldn't have

429
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:41,429
gone down if he had sent his son who is

430
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,829
a wizard these he's a fucking rich guy

431
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,929
why'd he put his son in the belly of a

432
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,079
fucking ship yet they're not in a nice

433
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,969
room they look like a nun a cargo hold

434
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,129
of a shitty shit why is this son even in

435
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,359
there that doesn't make any fucking

436
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,979
sense wizards

437
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,839
they show this carriage that can fly

438
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,509
through the sky with these cool dragons

439
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,209
they show me you can fucking travel and

440
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,609
teleport to different countries look at

441
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,289
that okay that guy bucket the bucket

442
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,399
it's the fucking I guess of this age

443
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,479
it's the mule trucks you know crossing

444
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:18,599
the border crossing the bus buckets

445
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:21,779
crossing bucket crossing so that

446
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,749
plotline is like what dog fuck okay but

447
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:26,249
maybe you can explain a way if you're

448
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,309
like a hardcore parafin shut up Joe he

449
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,009
said your evil French his father hated

450
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,459
his son but he loved him and he's frugal

451
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:38,399
so he gave him a coach ticket on the

452
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:41,279
Titanic under on the dead ship like the

453
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,879
Titanic okay so all that shit doesn't

454
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,859
make sense and then I guess Dumbledore

455
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,599
doesn't realize that he has a brother he

456
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,179
thinks he lost his sister is this did he

457
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:52,739
actually lose her sister and a brother

458
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:55,379
or was somebody lied to him and told him

459
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,329
that he had a sister when it's actually

460
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,799
a brother that's where it starts getting

461
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
all money I don't know

462
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,080
we need to name the goddamn book we all

463
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,799
break down and then what my favorite

464
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,809
part is he has a skull bong like he's

465
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,669
he's smoking out of this like magic

466
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,330
skull and they're in a grizzle bran is

467
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,789
like smoking out of this skull he's he's

468
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,919
smoking out of any blow smoke that tells

469
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,220
the future yes and it's really accurate

470
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,070
of the future and so all of them in the

471
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,630
wizard world they can know the future

472
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,120
but they don't do anything with it they

473
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,850
just it's so fucking stupid

474
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,820
we go get some lottery tickets or

475
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,520
something yeah I mean at this point that

476
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,860
the the universe of Harry Potter is kind

477
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,690
of crumbling in on itself with so many

478
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,890
inconsistent

479
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,250
my dick tentative magic it's all magic

480
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,750
and I'm afraid what's coming true is

481
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,820
with Alex the sames I go we live through

482
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,150
the amazing Star Wars and is worthy for

483
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,230
the prequels very potter

484
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,299
right so that it's it's the only reason

485
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,940
is because the only reason Creedence can

486
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,590
do that is because there's medic Lorient

487
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,059
counts are really high really high

488
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,850
really really high this movie doesn't

489
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,530
count you thought it was just because

490
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,929
certain Wizards have more skill than

491
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,640
other Wizards and you learn how to do

492
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,350
these things but no it's simply because

493
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,900
he had more medic Laurine okay I don't

494
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,760
understand how by the way I don't

495
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,870
understand how some ways are just

496
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,320
getting more powerful than the others

497
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,240
not fucking studying because that that

498
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,070
young kid didn't fucking study well

499
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,960
there's like there's many things like

500
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,370
Regents inside their wands and maybe

501
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,690
doesn't want oh yeah he doesn't have a

502
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,360
wand uh yeah so a lot a lot to sort

503
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,190
through there and this is probably super

504
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,710
painful for mega fans but you know

505
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,480
because it may seem like we're shooting

506
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,990
all over the universe but I'm taking it

507
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,120
from point of view of somebody who isn't

508
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,370
that familiar with it and you have to

509
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,580
realize that perhaps about 60% of the

510
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,590
audience maybe 70 80 percent of the

511
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,909
audience the people that don't haven't

512
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:05,530
read the books and they're just trying

513
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,150
to have a good time I don't think that I

514
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,340
shitting on this universe because I love

515
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,799
the universe I think that they made and

516
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,250
rushed through a shitty

517
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,680
they make a shitty part of the universe

518
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,350
it's fanzi to come out like the ratings

519
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,550
for this isn't very good

520
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,620
most Harry Potter movies were like 90

521
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,840
plus percent everyone loved them this

522
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
isn't the 50s and this is opening night

523
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,710
like they're probably gonna go this

524
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,840
feels like is misfiring and so it's

525
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,820
something was wrong and hopefully they

526
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,580
take the failings that clear failings

527
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,200
ahead here and they fix it because if

528
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,540
we're gonna watch the other ones which I

529
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,070
kind of want to because I want to see

530
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,050
them resolve this thing I want it to be

531
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,190
a good movie I don't let the struggle

532
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,500
through no that's our shit fest so do

533
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,720
you think that part of these reason why

534
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,060
this may not be working out as well as

535
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,640
you know people were hoping is the fact

536
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,800
that the books were already written in

537
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,140
it was a self-contained thing and she

538
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,520
had an idea of where she wanted to go

539
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,650
with it and then the fantastic beast

540
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,770
just you know is a smaller book and if

541
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,450
she's gonna do five movies than she

542
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,850
actually Shrek yes it actually makes

543
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,410
some of this stuff as it going along and

544
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,000
that doesn't have that same magic I

545
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,620
think that's the problem it could be

546
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,200
yeah yeah because it's hard to fill up

547
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,380
like a small book five movies you got to

548
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,440
do so who is this inconsequential who

549
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,910
was this character that I was like

550
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,890
there's this really old guy in it Oh

551
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,540
Nicholas he's an alchemist and

552
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,820
apparently he can live forever I'm like

553
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,370
holy shit why don't everybody become an

554
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,500
alchemist you're telling me that wizards

555
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,110
live and die in this world and they die

556
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,400
and not scared to death they don't

557
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,630
become alchemists the Philosopher's

558
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,920
Stone or the Sorcerer's Stone from the

559
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,880
Philosopher's Stone

560
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,890
yeah was that him that's him he created

561
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,390
the thing and so that's why he lived

562
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,130
forever and they sure Harry Potter

563
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,170
friends like whoa cool and then he they

564
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,350
did nothing with his character and I'm

565
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,660
like he's like I haven't seen action in

566
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,970
years and there's I gotta go he reads a

567
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,650
big looks in a book and this lady tells

568
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,780
him go fight and he's like okay I'm

569
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,550
going and then he goes out there and he

570
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,590
does what everybody else does he does

571
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,050
nothing special it was nothing special

572
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,710
they all slam they're like they're

573
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,480
fucking King Arthur or something and

574
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,710
slam their fucking sword

575
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,050
I mean wands into the ground

576
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,540
and make the fucking cage so that these

577
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,320
blue dragons the Griswold creates

578
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,100
Griswold creates to go destroy Paris did

579
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,080
he create them to destroy Paris I mean I

580
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,510
think so yeah if we don't stop it was

581
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,170
like what's gonna destroy Paris what how

582
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,060
do you know quietens of the dragon but

583
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,770
like everything from the previous scene

584
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,990
he's trying to set himself up as the

585
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,580
victim and as the good guy there's no

586
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,250
way why does he mean he Whedon's if he's

587
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,540
got blue dragons that can destroy cities

588
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,530
oh man fillers Joe it's because pillar

589
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,400
needs like filler films we need five

590
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,080
films men all right forget it

591
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,700
I'm tired of trying to figure out the

592
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,730
logic in the universe it is a math but

593
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,070
but see that's why because the Harry

594
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,130
Potter films did have a tighter feel to

595
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,040
him I had explanations for the spells it

596
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,660
made the incredibly powerful spells

597
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,220
intimidating and secretive I don't want

598
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,750
to say I don't know how to say it but

599
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,550
this one just kind of throws things left

600
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,770
and right in it and it cheapens it in it

601
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,650
in a way so we are in prequel territory

602
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,860
here okay can they correct it they do

603
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,080
have an opportunity to I think it's

604
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,800
possible

605
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,710
three more I just want to see shit throw

606
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,470
down if what I got from this film and

607
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,360
the best parts of this film the visuals

608
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,770
are fantastic the magic shit is cool and

609
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,840
the the speech like let's fucking fight

610
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,270
and let's fucking take shit over and

611
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,400
there's a civil war you set it up you

612
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,860
better pay this off and I'm talking a

613
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,740
better payoff than Death Dealers in the

614
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,320
background fighting in a you know parade

615
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,340
or whatever and better than Voldemort

616
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,870
and Harry Potter well that's a different

617
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,160
thing that's like a one-on-one battle

618
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,440
and I'm attacking the school I wanted

619
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,240
there to be a war and if you don't pay

620
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,400
this shit off you could tell clearly

621
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,300
what this was

622
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,820
it's like Saving Private Ryan Wizarding

623
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,730
style

624
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:38,720
yeah I'll be the guy with a Catalan one

625
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,670
the universe I'm actually made a Gatling

626
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,760
gun joke and remember the Kinect games

627
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,010
for Harry Potter and the way they

628
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:53,930
basically turned it into call of duty

629
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,490
that I want to see that shit

630
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,260
you want to make five more movies and

631
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,150
fucking do that alright because you've

632
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,260
already fucked it up let's go like seven

633
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,150
more love triangles to fill three more

634
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,240
movies god I don't care about their love

635
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,970
I really don't I want both of them to

636
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,370
fall off a cliff and die on impact

637
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm just kidding you it is alright how

638
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,540
many like more kids like a little like

639
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,430
infants kid are gonna die in this pill

640
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,100
we got two baby deaths two to two dead

641
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,170
babies in this one we'll stop the count

642
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,150
okay we should have a dead baby count

643
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,650
they make a graphic that's just like

644
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:47,940
head baby count nah I'm not making a man

645
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,980
I think JK Rowling's going off a rocker

646
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,650
this alright thank you so much for

647
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,130
watching

648
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,530
before we get downright attacked by

649
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,810
Harry Potter oh yeah alright thank you

650
