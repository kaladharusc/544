1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
one vehicle and the crane just came right on top of it this is like one

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,720
block from here

3
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,570
holy smokes

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,720
that's the crane

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,169
somebody just told me that

6
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:35,169
that's where it was and it felt this way

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,600
yeah

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,700
when I was up here last week shooting by drone recovery video I i got this shot

9
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:08,160
of the building where the crane was with the crane on it just by chance and

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,229
that's it that was the whole shot

11
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:17,190
here's what it looks like this morning with the crane god there's the crane

12
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:24,300
they're super insanely scary stuff bad stuff happens all the time in the city

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,420
but this is two blocks from my house in every blog greasy friend seen in me or

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,860
canvas Francine me walking the whole foods we walk down the street that this

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,970
crane fell on all those shots you see on the news of the crane smashing through

16
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,720
cars

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,780
those are the cars we walk past to get the grocery store

18
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,780

19
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,150

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400

avondale time in a while and it's in a normal male time I don't have nice

22
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,660
things

23
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,950
I don't have nice things because I break everything I can in the fancy tark's and

24
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,239
destroy it instead I Drive the toughest vehicle i can find a busted-up Jeep

25
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,930
even the camera equipment that i own is all broken

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,170
I don't wear fancy clothes I don't have like any jewelry

27
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,280

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,260

32
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,400
before the wedding day and thinking to myself this is the nicest thing I've

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,180
ever seen

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,870

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,900
unbreakable a white plastic watch fast forward like three months later three

38

41
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,920
really can't break a rubber band and all the sudden what was once way too

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,090
precious for me becomes a fairly practical wristwatch and the guy who

43
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,090
owns the watch band company got in touch and nieces on the vlog

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,989

49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900

50
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,959
whoa Mike this is awesome

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,639

52
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,280
rubber band for your fancy watch

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,239
ok back to mail time I know what's in these next mail time boxes so before I

54
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,849
open them a quick story but right after i posted the snowboarding in New York

55
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,509
City movie

56
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,500
some guy commented or tweet that mean he said way to totally screw up your

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,900
snowboard bag that bothered me for so many reasons the main reason was that

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,220
like yes it did screw up my snowboard which i loved it didn't wreck it

59
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,729
snowboarding the streets of Manhattan during the biggest blizzard in history

60
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,080
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and to not do that because I'm worried about

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,270
something like scratching my snowboard just seemed so like sure thing like how

62
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,509
short mind are you kid who commented on my youtube video

63
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:01,849
ok now i can open the next mail time package because i'm pretty sure I know

64
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,070
what it is

65
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,150
yeah

66
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,830
the company that made the snowboard that I was on in the video the company's

67
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,909
called lib Tech they make my favorite snowboard they saw the video and they

68
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,539
just sent me three brand-new snowboards

69
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,000
firstly thank you lib Tech in second the moral of the story is opportunity and

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,320
experience always Trump's material possessions at the end of the day if you

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,349
do something that you are that passionate about like something that is

72
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,759
that I mean come on snowboarding in new york city that like the universe will

73
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,750
make it right

74
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,930
in this case the universe is the snowboard manufacturers and they made it

75
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,930
right by 73 new ones

76
00:05:49,009 --> 00:06:05,629
they sent me another box to a surfboard

77
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:15,680
thanks liptak live to write this is a little abstract but but there with me

78
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,669
every time in my life where I've had to kind of ignore the consequences and go

79
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,539
for it

80
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,319
for the most part it's worked out

81
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,189
I'm thinking specifically like first time I max out my credit card to buy a

82
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:31,669
video camera really stupid thing to do never max out your credit card but if I

83
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,089
hadn't done it I may not have ever gotten into filmmaking

84
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:41,389
when I quit my job as a dishwasher because i wanted to move to if I hadn't

85
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:43,219
quit that job

86
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:47,719
like what would have happened but the other side of the coin is like don't max

87
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,899
out your credit card that's really stupid because don't quit your job

88
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,080
that's really stupid because don't still worth the streets that's really stupid

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,669
because there are always really good reasons not to do things like if you

90
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:04,550
really you really believe that it's something you have to do the universe

91
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,169
has a way of making it ok

92
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm not still talking about the snowboards by the way that's crazy but

93
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,149
they're a good example of what I'm trying to talk about also lib Tech I

94
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,360
love all the gear but like I don't really wear hats like this

95
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,899
my head's too big

96
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,150
New York City
