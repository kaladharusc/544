this is the billiard room and I really lacks the vocabulary and understanding

84
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:04,230
to describe what this room looks like this is guest room number 1 complete

85
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,120
with adequate closet space and private bathroom

86
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,680
this is the library

87
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
you're going to want to see this

88
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
hmm

89
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:38,859

90
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,819

and this this is the dining room

97
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,130
if I had moved right now I would be I know

98
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,490
hmm about my tour of this place it doesn't know justice for starters it's

99
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,590
hard to get a feel for scale the true magnitude of this space on camera

100
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,400
secondly i'm a bit of a Philistine I don't know much about this place

101
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,140
I can't share that third I skipped all the details like the fine wood carving

102
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,370
on the walls of the billiard room but i can tell you this to read this room for

103
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,300
one night

104
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:13,790
cost the same amount is a brand-new Toyota i didn't i didn't spend 18 grand

109
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,840
little groggy but I've got a perfect

110
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:45,470
this is not my bedroom but I've got a perk up before and I gotta pick up with

111
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,400
that this is an important event is the very businesslike thing is you need a

112
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,230
lot of important people

113
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,610
