1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,870
hey guys so a brand new trailer for

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,980
transformers bumblebee is out right now

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,349
Joe you're not excited well I think it's

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,049
pretty brave picking up the Transformers

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,260
franchise everything that's happened

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,680
that's risky things 6 all right so let's

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,449
check it out let's see what's going on

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,640
we've already done one but I've been

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,810
hearing good things about this

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,910
particular trailer so alright here we go

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:38,790
3 2 1 go I'm Shirley Watson

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:52,230
I'm 18 today Charlie Watson over the

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,449
book and his big floppy falls out so

14
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,210
there you're reminded right here of

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,309
Michael Bay transformers a little bit

16
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm a little more simplistic design

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,090
there

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,530
Christmas so you have no idea where he

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,780
came from a Christmas bill

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,930
sweet fro dude people can be terrible

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,730
[Music]

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,550
oh nice there's a war raging on our

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,030
planet

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,370
if this criminal isn't found that war

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,410
may find its way who the hell are they

26
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:57,640
those are Decepticons Joe

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,090
they're calling an army Oh firsthand

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,550
these things really oh man that look

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,590
great that was the original g1 OB there

30
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,030
is only one way

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,770
oh yeah you must protect earth and its

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:26,380
people I said seven films b1

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,050
holy shit okay this trailers look a

34
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,330
bunch better than the barrier set I can

35
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,580
actually see what's happening in the

36
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:44,240
battles Joe look at the way it's film

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,070
that still looks a little little hooky

38
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:58,140
yeah okay

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,090
Christmas hold on let me get we get

40
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,910
right there okay Joe what did you think

41
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,590
it's not as bad as I thought it was

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,410
gonna be right because obviously you

43
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,270
have to follow up the other ones and I

44
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,460
was like how what are you gonna do you

45
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,500
have a big reveal after I saw some of

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,220
the scenes in you this is yeah good

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,260
battle scenes we got to see Cybertron

48
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,750
the biggest thing for me Joe was is

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,890
redesigned yes g1 dude I did not expect

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,840
that I'm over here thinking okay seventh

51
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,330
film or sixth film in the Transformers

52
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,810
series and it they actually had the

53
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,210
balls to go you know what let's not do

54
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,100
the stupid Michael Bay thing which by

55
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,320
the way this is not directed by Michael

56
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,090
Bay which is another good thing

57
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,320
potentially good thing

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,940
now Michael Bay knows his action right

59
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,250
when the explosions but from what I've

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,170
seen in the trailer the action looks

61
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,020
great here see what's going on yeah we

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,959
have a female lead which you know in in

63
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,280
the last transformers Phil in the

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,470
marketing tried to play that up like you

65
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,400
know right I know exactly and I think it

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,709
was just a bad decision here this seems

67
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,600
more genuine this just seems like a you

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,760
know it's just a girl growing up and she

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,609
manages to run into this friggin

70
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,970
transformer you know bumblebee and he's

71
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,190
in his original sort of bug form here

72
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,290
not the Camaro form so I guess maybe he

73
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,690
gets that later so I don't know I'm a

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,450
little confused I thought this was a you

75
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,700
know the sixth film or whatever but it

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,250
almost looks a little bit like a reboot

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,280
and I it's gotta be a reboot and I hope

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,710
if this is successful well no not really

79
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,870
Joe because look his face is the face

80
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,169
from from the Michael Bay's transformers

81
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,060
this looks like bumblebee from the

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,100
Michael Bay transformers but whatever I

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,040
want it to be a reboot okay you know so

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,420
at first you got to kind of hear the

85
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,550
old-school transformations a little more

86
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,540
complex of all the designs you know

87
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,970
bumblebee well bumblebee kind of already

88
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,130
looks a little bit like this anyway even

89
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,180
in the older Transformers but this kind

90
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,210
of is a more hybrid between the the g1

91
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,530
and the the the new Transformers I kind

92
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,120
of wish bumblebee was a little more

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,770
simplistic like those other G ones that

94
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,600
we saw okay so it opens up a Christmas

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,370
we got maybe a little love story here

96
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,470
with the with this guy right here

97
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,100
it is I think set in the 80s or 90s

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,690
maybe I'm not really sure but it looks

99
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,200
like you know it's a different kind of

100
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,760
storytelling here this is actually

101
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,930
surprisingly directed by Travis what's

102
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,050
his name Travis Knight and he did

103
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,840
Kubo in the two strings okay yeah I like

104
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,250
that one I didn't oh yeah it's like a

105
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,110
stop-motion animation movie it's

106
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,250
actually pretty good it was kind of

107
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,980
under under appreciated and and not many

108
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,380
people talked about including us but it

109
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,250
was actually pretty good

110
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,970
so with that under your belt you know

111
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,040
I'm actually kind of excited about it

112
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,080
you know it seems to be a little bit

113
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,170
more faithful to the you know cartoon

114
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,120
and the animated series and I don't know

115
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
about you but if we as we look here the

116
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,370
action I can actually keep an eye on and

117
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:32,970
see bumblebee that that's always good a

118
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,370
lot of expression in his face which is

119
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,280
good so originally I was thinking that

120
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,580
it was like Starscream you know because

121
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,440
they showed a jet trailer in the last

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,650
one yeah but it's not Starscream I'm

123
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,510
trying to figure out who it is okay so I

124
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,030
had to look it up and it was not

125
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,450
Starscream that's chasing him but it's

126
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,080
actually a one called blitz wing right

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,210
and we learn through this trailer

128
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,860
actually that we have two other

129
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,730
Decepticons which I guess is a triple

130
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,040
transform right because you've got the

131
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,320
robot forms they were just what a

132
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,050
helicopter yeah an attack helicopter and

133
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,640
a Harrier jet and then now a mousseline

134
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,310
two muscle cars you're freaking awesome

135
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,720
these guys let's see are shatter and

136
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,810
dropkick and they're also hunting

137
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,660
bumblebees and these guys actually work

138
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,450
with the US military in order to track

139
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,790
down bumblebee who is on some kind of

140
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,080
secret mission from Optimus Prime here

141
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,660
at the end you know you get to see a

142
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,070
little bit of that but they're

143
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,750
Decepticons guess what they're doing

144
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,550
they're deceiving they're talking with

145
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,860
the US military but they're probably

146
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,570
presenting themselves like they're the

147
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,030
good guys right now now is John Cena

148
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,430
going to be a bad guy in this film yes

149
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:09,020
it looks like it oh yeah he's got that

150
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,480
but maybe you know he'll see these guys

151
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,270
shit and then I realize oh these are the

152
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,310
bad guys and then switch sides I don't

153
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,470
know I don't know it is interesting okay

154
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,720
so we got some new designs here but boy

155
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,050
I thought it was really cool a lot of

156
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,270
transforming happening it looks like

157
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,010
there's lots of you know

158
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,979
scenes between her and bumblebee and in

159
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,860
a very private intimate you know

160
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,960
close-up setting to really build these

161
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,190
two characters together I like that

162
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:56,450
especially we still can't talk

163
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,070
that reminds me of the cartoon I loved

164
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,410
it Joe this is exactly kind of what I

165
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,830
wanted to see some of the original stuff

166
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,260
here it looks like this is a fight on

167
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,270
cybertron and you know this is probably

168
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,150
the opening of the film where you know

169
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,150
Optimus sends him out on the mission to

170
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,670
earth and this is the one who I thought

171
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,460
was was you know Starscream but no

172
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,850
that's so we'll see how well some of

173
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,310
these Decepticons are set up so cool

174
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,470
that we get to see Optimus in his

175
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:40,620
original form Soundwave I totally didn't

176
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,900
expect Soundwave to be in it that's so

177
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,970
cool and he pops out what was that one

178
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,870
it's a shit I forget what it's called

179
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,460
it's been a long damn time I think

180
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,370
ravage though he's a bad guy so you can

181
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,570
see right there looky throw the little

182
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,880
girls on hook Lord come on John Cena

183
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,690
turning heel whoo and then he just got

184
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,730
shot in the face by bumblebee yeah

185
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,959
Oh III guys this trailer did it this

186
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,179
trailer did its job seriously

187
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:23,779
I am the rest all right I mean this is

188
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,369
the only part that like you know I don't

189
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,220
know if it works there's just too much I

190
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,259
guess from right here the CGI didn't

191
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,029
look all that great but you know they're

192
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:34,519
trying to give a little bit of tension

193
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,709
here where two robots are fighting right

194
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,339
above you and he's trying to protect her

195
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,639
yeah so I went from don't give you no

196
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,759
don't give a shit that should be you cuz

197
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,199
you're the one that doesn't give a shit

198
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,779

199
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,559
this now okay Oh robot action g1

200
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,019
actually action Michael Bay's not Harvey

201
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,749
no more cool boy one stream more of that

202
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,910
fighting that we saw that was pretty

203
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,589
badass oh I'm gonna tell you right now

204
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,160
you sold me I know I know it's not gonna

205
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,899
be majority the movie but I think it

206
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,179
lasts longer than two minutes come on

207
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,399
I'm sorry guys it's two minutes I'm

208
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:24,199
telling you that we all on Cybertron and

209
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,600
let's support the soul you know like

210
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,089
Beast Wars or the original transformers

211
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,269
g1 stuff but no yeah no okay yeah you're

212
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,739
right that's what sold me too

213
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,249
I'm excited about bumblebee now

214
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,329
enthusiastic about seeing it and telling

215
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,699
people about it which is crazy I don't

216
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,439
know how they did that at the sixth

217
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:47,149
seventh film so alright did its job I

218
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,039
hope it's gonna be a good film but like

219
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,919
I said it's probably mainly a story

220
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,499
about her girl in her pet yeah you know

221
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,589
with the war in the background and maybe

222
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,869
it sets up if it does well enough maybe

223
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,569
it sets up some g1 storylines where we

224
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:04,339
could just forget about the other

225
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,549
transformer film and just carry over the

226
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,470
I said it's pretty brave for them to

227
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,749
take this project on trailer in fact

228
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:14,509
wait a minute before I go I just

229
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,309
remembered that there is an

230
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,249
international trailer that shows a tiny

231
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:22,489
bit more footage and so I want to I want

232
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,669
to see it if it was that well done it's

233
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:27,410
mostly the same trailer

234
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,440
but here we go let's see your national

235
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,839
trailer yeah a little bit different

236
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,000
oh that's just the intro thing oh no

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,290
there's a little battle

238
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:51,709
what do you say us trailers guys you

239
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,959
gotta keep an eye out that looks great

240
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,529
these are practical looking effects that

241
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,120
looks so great it almost look practical

242
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
that was not practical though was it

243
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,839
when he lands in the water

244
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,000
oh no that looks great

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,810
I want the beetle work here every day

246
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,350

254

- the military

263
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,410

yeah that was Ravager

267
00:14:49,640 --> 00:15:04,220
[Music]

268
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,779
bring everything they would give context

269
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:19,769
to that this was a much better to other

270
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,569
guys I highly recommend the

271
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:23,490
International trailer it was art it

272
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,230
already did this job as did a way better

273
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,180
job here why didn't they do that I guess

274
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,490
cuz they really revealed the context of

275
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,620
the joke jokes and stuff and they want

276
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,899
to save that for I don't know the film I

277
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,939
don't know but I know there's a much

278
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:38,879
better trailer alright guys so yeah hype

279
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,250
level went way up I think that this is

280
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,319
probably a from what it looks like here

281
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,970
this looks like it's gonna be one of the

282
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,329
best Transformers films and those here's

283
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,689
