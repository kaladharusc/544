00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,710
[Music]

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:24,619
I guess yeah well anyways guys welcome

3
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:26,960
to another movie review and you might

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
have guessed we just came back from

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,040
Halloween yay

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,020
now if you haven't seen the last sort is

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,840
eight or nine don't you forget all of

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
them but the first one because they do

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,320
not matter anymore and this one

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,309
basically kicks off as forty years later

11
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,629
we're with Laurie she's paranoid and

12
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,710
super rich oh she's got this like murder

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,960
mansion that she's made and she's got

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,109
all these guns and a really cool place

15
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,269
because she's been praying every night

16
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,559
if something's in the trailer she's been

17
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,120
praying every night that Michael gets

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,210
out because she wants to kill him and he

19
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,240
does and now we have a movie so what do

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,869
you think patient's though you have high

21
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:15,729
hopes

22
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:21,409
we're like alright I've seen all of them

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,490
unfortunately all right I'm going in

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,110
open-minded yes this should be better

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,479
because I did like the Rob Zombie remake

26
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:30,979
I was like let's see what they can do

27
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,049
yeah but you like sex Squatch and like

28
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:40,340
other did you just start the review

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,369
without me yeah yes how did you even get

30
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,289
these camera set up or anything like

31
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,780
there's somebody do it for you here was

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,579
he just sitting right here staring at

33
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,130
y'all that wasn't me man y'all might

34
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,880
wanna check all right Joe so give us a

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,859
plot synopsis which is basically what

36
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:04,340
you just did she old and Michael's old

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,829
and they're going to have a final

38
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,140
confrontation I uses that Activia money

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,510
to set up her a little like she does

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,720
have a lot of funds for this laboratory

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,940
of machine guns

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,400
it was a horrible thing Kevin

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,260
McCallister would be very upset with her

44
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,070
I mean he did it right now so alright

45
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,970
guys so Halloween is it worth it well I

46
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,940
gotta say I'm for me I was pretty bored

47
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,590
through most of it

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,200
this film plays it a little bit too safe

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
we've gone through you know a bunch of

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,820
films six seven eight you know nine I

51
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,530
don't know what the hell were at right

52
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,220
it was a dream and and and with all of

53
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,000
that under its belt it really does the

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,300
trophy thing okay so with its doing

55
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,280
tropes and it's not it's not very

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,710
entertaining initially there's a lot of

57
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,960
believability issues with this some

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,770
seventy plus year old man doing these

59
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,320
crazy what the hell are they feeding him

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,250
at the hospital

61
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,100
Ave they probably oh that's I like they

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,690
do power lifting five days a week

63
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,380
because he's strong people to do that

64
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,630
it's these low tea centers like as soon

65
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,459
as he hits 35 they just start giving the

66
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,300
injection so like he's jacked so about a

67
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,170
there's maybe one creative kill where

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,790
you felt a little bit of tension in the

69
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,400
scene felt it was kind of cool because

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
they had set the characters up a little

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,290
bit prior and then it goes into a third

72
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,610
act with same average climax that gets

73
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,550
cut short pretty a little unsatisfying

74
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,280
ending you can tell they want to sequel

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,020
bate and I really hate these things

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,300
and when you have an ending like that

77
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,000
and a relatively boring movie aside from

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,209
maybe one kill and and then an alright

79
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,130
conclusion it just feels too standard

80
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,160
guys it was a very standard film my

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,410
expectations were much lower than his so

82
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,760
I thought this was better than I thought

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,570
it was gonna be

84
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,800
we doesn't mean I think this was a very

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,790
good movie it started slow like really

86
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,010
slow but once it got going and once you

87
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,300
know Michael's out and about and he's

88
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
escaped and he's just mindlessly

89
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,560
murdering people it was a bad like did

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,820
you think it was a bad film when he

91
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,530
started killing people like there's

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,150
teenagers like dry humping on a couch

93
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,090
and then

94
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,410
they're dead and then there's like a

95
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,150
funny little kid and then and then

96
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,650
someone else died I mean there's a lot

97
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,169
of tropes but it wasn't bad right it

98
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,630
wasn't bad this film I will say though

99
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,470
five kills that's it's getting pretty

100
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,850
lame there I mean I have at least 16 but

101
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,540
I mean I have no in call duty put this

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,830
in Call of Duty yeah but I don't know

103
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,230
I'm like you know because audience

104
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,990
modern audiences has seen so much it's

105
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,479
like and you're throwing away all the

106
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,110
sequels

107
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,870
everything that he did the supernatural

108
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,250
kind of strength and all this other

109
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,340
stuff in those other films this film

110
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,470
expects you to know about all that to

111
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,210
give him the tension kill five people

112
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,120
yeah that's even but pure evil you mean

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,919
there are people in jail that have done

114
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,180
more than that this movie was plagued

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,760
with jump scares oh it was more

116
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,919
suspenseful there's like where is the

117
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,960
next jump scare game I was not worried

118
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,060
about Mike Myers I was worried about all

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,530
what's the next cheesy thing that's

120
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,240
gonna pop that's hey how you doing

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,430
what's up right it's just a do come all

122
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,630
and throw it through coming through the

123
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,430
doors that are you know it's so that's

124
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,070
criminal when when when there's no

125
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,620
tension coming from Michael himself when

126
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,289
it's jump scares and that's the issues

127
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,570
there's very it's a very low on scares

128
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,050
it's more like an action film than than

129
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,150
the thriller the original is much better

130
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,260
than this

131
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,200
however it's not incompetent it's not

132
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
the worst thing that we've ever seen

133
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,490
it's probably better than half if not

134
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,120
all of the sequels I mean I've seen him

135
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,100
to me and Joe gone through the history

136
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,729
but preparing for this for you know four

137
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,950
through six season the witch Halloween

138
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,600
three that has nothing to do with

139
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,810
Michael Myers has to do with some some

140
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,789
masks and stone hands or some bullshit

141
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:27,539
which was

142
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,550
I don't know creatively filmed I like

143
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,070
the color palette in that that film four

144
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,110
through six deals with a little bit of

145
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,970
the supernatural they bring in some

146
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,820
thing called you know thorn which is

147
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,550
like this cult aspect and possibly a

148
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,560
curse of Michael Myers

149
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,310
natural strengths but we don't have any

150
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,770
that was that was that was the other

151
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,139
ones oh so this one basically and this

152
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,530
h2o it doesn't even pick up after h2o to

153
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,590
get rid of that certainly not after

154
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,880
Halloween resurrection which destroyed

155
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,760
the franchise which is most well noted

156
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,510
for Busta Rhymes using Kongfu on Michael

157
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,060
Mars like not I'm not exaggerating he is

158
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,000
literally doing kungfu he is even going

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,870
to what it's amazing I know it's kind of

160
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,460
amazing like you should watch that no

161
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,110
don't watch the movie just watch that

162
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,760
clean YouTube it it's great so yeah

163
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,340
however what about the Acting itself I

164
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,680
thought Jamie Lee Curtis she's an

165
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,600
excellent actress and she holds her own

166
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,510
here I believe that she's been tortured

167
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,100
for for all this time and that she's

168
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,250
prepping for the return of Michael as

169
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,990
with all of her weapons and her training

170
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,310
and I believe that she is a threat and

171
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,530
Judy Greer did a really good job like

172
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,940
one thing that really try to do is

173
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,220
explain the mother-daughter relationship

174
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,320
where Judy Greer plays her daughter and

175
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,380
it's just tired of the paranoia and

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,720
being raised in a bunker and it was

177
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,180
really really good like she every time

178
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,500
they're together you read the body

179
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,970
language she's just like she's at it

180
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,970
she's done it take the movie does take

181
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,710
away well we'll talk about that in

182
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,150
spoilers I was about to give you one

183
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,030
let's avoid spoilers here and and talk

184
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,039
about that in the spoilers section but

185
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,550
the body count what did you guys think

186
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,580
you know is is Michael Myers an actual

187
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,370
psycho in this one and easy is he pure

188
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,330
evil

189
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,250
cuz Rob Zombie a lot of criticism from

190
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,339
the Rob Zombie version is it good guy it

191
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,190
only kills like bad people and people

192
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,349
that are fuckin jerks does he kill

193
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,419
people that are innocent yeah and pretty

194
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,770
indiscriminately he just like walks

195
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,290
through houses and he's like you're dead

196
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,260
hammer right knife knife which leads to

197
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,170
a little bit of coincidence the movie

198
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,240
again just a little just a little

199
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,339
worried pretty much ends up always at

200
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,920
the same place and on all these

201
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,690
multitude of sequels

202
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,950
they kind of tied in the fact that

203
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,840
Michael likes to return to his house it

204
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,940
doesn't matter who's in the house like

205
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,130
seriously do not live in that house okay

206
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,650
cuz Michael's coming back but they don't

207
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,940
really do that here they kind of ignore

208
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,830
the house and their did they got this

209
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,830
out in the woods grandma's house you

210
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,410
know Jamie Lee Curtis this house is kind

211
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,910
of where this film is centered and you

212
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,890
know and you got to find a way to bring

213
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,020
Michael there and a little bit of

214
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,560
coincidence but yeah it the film suffers

215
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,980
from a lot of bad writing and tropes

216
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,780
just trying to find a way to get to the

217
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,220
next scene

218
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,320
and I don't do you think they're aware

219
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,900
of that in the writing oh yeah okay I

220
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,600
think they poked fun at it I think they

221
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
made the movie exactly they made the

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,860
movie they set out to make exactly this

223
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,470
type of film right where there was a lot

224
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,480
of tropi things there nodding at some of

225
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,950
the other ones they specifically

226
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,540
mentioned oh no no no they're not

227
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,490
brother and sister right they bring up

228
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,080
other mistakes that they made in some of

229
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,420
the previous totally like her being you

230
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,510
know his sister because that kind of

231
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,700
gives him a reason to come and finish

232
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,210
the job

233
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,380
so I don't like that change surprisingly

234
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,480
the film is written by Danny McBride me

235
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,760
and Joe were like wait bride like yeah

236
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,370
apparently is a big Halloween fan help

237
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,260
write the movie they were gonna film two

238
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,330
films back-to-back at the same time it

239
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,520
goes well maybe we should see if this

240
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,140
one does better it's a smarter choice

241
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,750
but you can really tell that this is

242
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,180
kind of an incomplete you know some

243
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,710
people would say oh this is satisfying

244
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,270
we finally get to see them fight and and

245
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,170
resolve this story yes but I was hoping

246
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,030
for a little greater impact there

247
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,690
towards the end there's a there's a

248
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,100
scene with you you say well Michael has

249
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,950
this tie to obviously the the title of

250
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,600
the film Halloween and he kind of does

251
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,339
all of his stuff on Halloween

252
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,320
somebody just locked that motherfucker

253
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,380
down on this day or lock the town down

254
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,660
this bus all you've seen it in the

255
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,910
trailer the bus crashes and Michael

256
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,490
escapes to give us this damn movie but

257
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,250
one of the you know sort of Texas Ranger

258
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,160
cops with wearing this cowboy has like

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,089
what are we gonna do cancel Halloween

260
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,089
yeah fucking put a fucking APB out and

261
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,670
go on the NewsCenter and say there is a

262
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,149
killer loose on Halloween night in your

263
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,540
area he has killed five people and he

264
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,040
has killed a bunch of and he's killed

265
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,069
two cops on his bus stay inside and lock

266
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,470
your doors which means we have no movie

267
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,930
still be yeah but that would still cause

268
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,160
frenzy amongst people you think it

269
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,069
caused riots Joe what fuckin Universal

270
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:48,689
you live in little kids not being able

271
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:58,649
to get their candy oh the vigilante ban

272
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,069
from fucking Halloween six or five or

273
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:07,050
something well these are gone yeah the

274
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,430
whole point of this movie is so we don't

275
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,829
have to watch any of the other ones

276
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:14,610
right all right what about any of these

277
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,189
so the we fucked up thought the subplots

278
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:20,939
were handled well one was stupid one was

279
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,009
really stupid we have to talk about it

280
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,829
in spoilers but one is really stupid I

281
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,139
think the film does a much better job

282
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,180
okay let's talk about what the film gets

283
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,540
right well it's not particularly scary

284
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,339
and the kills are not particularly

285
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,649
gruesome most of what you see happens

286
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,110
after the fact it's not real gory or

287
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,350
anything but one thing it does well is

288
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,350
setting up the quick characters before

289
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,720
they get killed to make you sympathize

290
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,209
with them this was done you know back in

291
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,930
the 70s or the original film 1978 they

292
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,490
don't really set up it's more like all

293
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,259
kids having sex and older gonna die

294
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,269
right and you don't really like them too

295
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:01,459
much they're kind of all assholes

296
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,720
especially in some of the later films

297
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,579
like the Rob Zombie film everybody's a

298
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,860
fucking asshole here they do the reverse

299
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,620
of that everybody feels genuine they

300
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,439
these feel like real people the kids

301
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,269
getting babysit that feels like an

302
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,809
actual babysit or situation and the kid

303
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,189
talking to the baby sitter baby sitter

304
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:21,990
talking to the kid they feel realistic

305
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,779
characters and you you only are with

306
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,910
them for you know a little bit of time

307
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,050
but you're in

308
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,330
in these characters and you either don't

309
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,010
want to see them die you do want to see

310
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,880
them die boy friends friends of friends

311
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,890
everybody I think has little droplets of

312
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,200
lines that really kind of flesh out

313
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,390
their characters and make you feel that

314
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,550
they're realistic people as opposed to

315
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,370
all the Hokey slasher obviously

316
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,190
carpenter inspired you know a huge flash

317
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,579
or John in the original Halloween so I

318
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:54,990
think they did a good job there I think

319
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,370
so too I think one thing that they

320
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,620
really did well that I wish we saw more

321
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,329
of was this pg-13 or R hmm I don't know

322
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,220
if it was our I wish they had shown me a

323
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,660
little bit more there's some scenes

324
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,029
where you see the bodies after Michael's

325
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,010
done with them and they're really cool

326
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,230
they did a really good job like ripping

327
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,660
a jaw off of some guy and he's messing

328
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,459
all of his teeth and you see that in the

329
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,899
trailer and the guy is nailed to a wall

330
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,970
and it's like wow I really wish we got

331
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,200
to see it especially if it's rated R

332
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,370
it's like when I cut that stuff out

333
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,290
because I think would have really and

334
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,120
that's where you're going in for that's

335
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,620
because they kept saying one one of the

336
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,940
problems that I had with it is the

337
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,100
entire time the keys pure evil it's like

338
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,140
you've shown me what I know the first

339
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,089
film which which I watched there's

340
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,350
nothing in that film makes me think he's

341
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,870
pure evil he's a serial killer I mean

342
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,839
he's not a nice guy

343
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,430
Oh pure evil

344
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,220
it is it it is rated R yeah it's rated R

345
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,339
and this pure evil stuff I think that is

346
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,500
the excuse they use for his super

347
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
natural strength we don't want to ruin

348
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,940
what punishment Michael takes we could

349
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,040
talk about that in the spoiler section

350
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,829
but you got to feel he is well fucking

351
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,870
Michael mind he's indestructible ma'am

352
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,250
so alright guys um well that's I mean we

353
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,199
could talk ad nauseam about the film but

354
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,410
really it's a rather simple setup you're

355
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,040
just setting up the the family of Jamie

356
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,990
Lee Curtis this character where they're

357
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,029
at in their lives all the people around

358
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,790
them until Michael breaks out and all

359
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,529
hell breaks loose on the night of

360
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,589
Halloween and we get essentially a fight

361
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,740
between her Laurie and and Michael Myers

362
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,140
and you could tell their sequel baiting

363
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,360
really hard here blum house wants their

364
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,400
own

365
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,230
Halloween franchise this thing has been

366
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,650
done to death over and over however I

367
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,960
will say it was not a massive disaster

368
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,690
it was not the worst thing I've ever

369
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,350
seen but I feel just a tiny bit of

370
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,200
wasted potential and that only really

371
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,260
comes from on purpose that I think they

372
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,360
were really trying to pay homage to the

373
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,250
original trying to stay a little can't

374
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,020
be a little cheesy here and there yeah

375
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,940
and they do an effective job of that but

376
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,850
it's just it's 2018 we've seen this all

377
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,980
before there's a lot of tropes in there

378
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,980
I know you guys did it first a lot but

379
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,990
we're kind of looking for some more we

380
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,120
wanted more you'll get 40 years to

381
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,730
improve on it right 40 years like give

382
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,010
him giving a little bit more and yeah so

383
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,360
let's go ahead and give some final

384
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,490
verdict so start with Alex this time I'm

385
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,580
gonna give this a 6 and I think this is

386
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,440
for the most part kind of an average

387
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
film it starts really slow like really

388
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,470
slow but then picks up a little bit he

389
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,089
goes on a little murder rampage that I

390
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:44,420
kind of enjoyed I thought that some of

391
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,070
the the bodies left behind were pretty

392
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,440
good I mean it was cheesy but it you

393
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,089
definitely knew that they knew this was

394
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,709
cheesy I mean they they constantly are

395
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,510
referencing all of their previous films

396
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,300
so I don't know if I'd rush out and see

397
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,370
this with with a bunch of people this

398
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,680
weekend but I think this is just just

399
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,309
barely above average for a horror film

400
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:06,410
for me I did like the whole

401
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,030
mother-daughter thing with Jamie Lee

402
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,709
Curtis I want to see more of that and I

403
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,870
want to see more in-depth look with

404
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,089
Jamie's character instead of the

405
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,809
granddaughter

406
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:15,949
I think they focus too much on the

407
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,929
granddaughter for Jamie they're gonna

408
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,959
make this thing about them to focus on

409
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,079
Jamie's sequel baiting though yeah it's

410
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,030
too much of that I did not feel

411
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,330
satisfied with the ending scene it left

412
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,929
me like this is it I did not like that

413
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm gonna give this a 4 move below

414
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,990
average film for me

415
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,380
he said cut it this one does not that's

416
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,570
a six that was six slashes six lashes so

417
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,750
six is six is not bad I mean so this is

418
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,130
below average so look we go Halloween

419
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,110
biased cuz like Mike Myers was never one

420
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,520
of my one of my top go to a horror films

421
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,270
is either sasquatches up there for you

422
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,760
either Jason or Friday the 13th I I

423
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,400
agree I think Jason and Friday 13th is

424
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,710
better and Michael's kind of third place

425
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,110
for me and so I can see where you're

426
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,790
coming from Joe six out of ten

427
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,500
is the rating Michael gave before he

428
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,740
left even Michael you know does not like

429
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,270
in the film he's trying to stab me on

430
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,360
his way out but luckily I got out of it

431
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,280
yeah I got I got I got some moves as

432
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,830
very few people can escape like good job

433
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,300
he's 70 years old yeah III thought well

434
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,710
here's the thing Joe I hurt his knees

435
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,690
creaking as he was coming so it's like I

436
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,910
was already prepared and everything

437
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,890
about me alright guys so that's our

438

anybody want to start okay I'll start

453
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:41,080
Darren I really liked the little kid who

454
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,359
her friend was babysitting so it was a

455
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,029
Rachel I don't remember the she goddamn

456
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:49,570
daughter's name has her friend Allison

00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,619
her boyfriend dies they had planned to

459
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:57,080
smoke weed at this house and and maybe

460
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,909
it'll do a little bit of dry humping and

461
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:02,029
some sexual myths of course Michael now

462
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,379
they don't actually really get to come

463
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,879
together and they're Michael's do the

464
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:06,979
last slasher thing kind of takes them

465
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:11,389
out one by one but I just love this

466
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,059
little kid I think that he is great

467
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,129
actor he just made me laugh and he's

468
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,559
like oh shit he's like reacting like we

469
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,739
would react if Michael was real and if

470
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,450
the situation really haven't no there is

471
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,269
a guy up there like can you send that

472
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:27,769

476
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,039
dies

477
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,789
Dave dies but the kid the kid does not

478
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,029
die so I'm happy that he maybe we'll see

479
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,099
him in the seat Michael also like spared

480
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:44,960
a baby yeah I know god I was gonna kill

481
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,340
a kid oh wow this movie's gonna get

482
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,879
really dark I actually kind of you know

483
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,369
was thinking that that he was okay I was

484
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,779
about to see yeah I was kind of hoping

485
00:20:53,779 --> 00:21:06,470
he was gonna murder that baby and then

486
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,659
you will find dirty secrets don't you

487
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:12,739
open my closets baby killer

488
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,289
no but I was thinking that that film

489
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,419
needed a harder edge or something that

490
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,039
we had really not seen before

491
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,259
whereas Rob Zombie's film made him

492
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,879
almost an antihero

493
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,710
I thought at that moment just like you

494
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,749
Alex that he was gonna go over there and

495
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:29,090
fucking we got that little baby one of

496
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,249
the first I think the first kill we see

497
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,039
is he kills a like a little kid I mean

498
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,440
like 12 years old 13 year old kid but he

499
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,299
kills a kid that's the first one we see

500
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,299
the first kill is a kill who again a

501
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,350
character you like they do these

502
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,590
dialogue drops very effective way back

503
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,720
from 1978 I feel like the writing wasn't

504
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,730
as strong as it was here in order to

505
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,169
invest you in the characters it seemed

506
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,240
like this kid loved to dance he didn't

507
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,799
really like going hunting and fishing

508
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,570
and all this manly stuff that his father

509
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,220
wanted now I don't I don't think they

510
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,419
weren't flying that he was gay or

511
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,679
anything like that they would just you

512
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,120
know hey look he likes it maybe they're

513
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,500
character-building and they did a really

514
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,820
good job like you could see that the

515
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,980
father's rolling his eyes okay and you

516
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,929
could tell and his father wasn't against

517
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,880
her or anything and he just you know was

518
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,350
hoping his son would be more and a what

519
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,909
he's into and his son is just kind of

520
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,440
doing his own thing both these

521
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,179
motherfuckers die you know so I'm like

522
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,340
they do a good job of setting up these

523
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,929
people and then they dine you like fuck

524
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,690
Michael is evil as shit and that's why I

525
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,860
thought he was gonna go and kill that

526
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,809
damn baby later on cuz he's literally

527
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,370
killing everybody well because he

528
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,530
escapes Michael in this new universe

529
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,510
Jamie Lee Curtis the baby has escaped

530
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,909
the baby which makes sense because he

531
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,030
didn't kill the baby Jamie Lee Curtis

532
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,620
that would be Halloween - that ties it

533
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,380
says she's the little baby okay that

534
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,210
didn't happen so really only Jamie Lee

535
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,030
Curtis has escaped that little kid maybe

536
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,909
sick kid escaped did he ignore anybody

537
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,490
else yeah he the two kids that run into

538
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,470
him in the middle of Halloween at all

539
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,450
sorry sir and then he just goes around

540
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,400
cuz he wants to kill some random lady

541
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,380
they don't escape from him as much as

542
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,510
there's a ton of people around and maybe

543
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,100
he just knows not to murder a bunch of

544
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,299
little kids and then everybody in the

545
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,919
front of everybody okay so Michaels not

546
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,350
that crazy where he's just gonna murder

547
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,179
you in front of everybody he tries to

548
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,309
make his targets see and that's why I

549
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:18,809
don't understand without Jamie Lee

550
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,260
Curtis being his sister he kind of goes

551
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,630
on this indiscriminate killing spree out

552
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,400
in the middle of Halloween night just

553
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,650
going random house-to-house doesn't

554
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,240
really even go to his house I don't

555
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,280
think that was his house and it just

556
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,960
felt a little too random and yet he

557
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,780
somehow ends up in the same place where

558
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,179
you know her granddaughter is at this

559
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,530
high school dance

560
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,539
of course her boyfriends getting drunk

561
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,880
you think he's a good guy at first but

562
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,470
it turns out he's kissing on some other

563
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,230
hot chick and then and then she gets mad

564
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,510
at him that's a reason for them to

565
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,140
separate and he runs into the inmate in

566
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,669
me just so happen around

567
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,649
into each other because the friend of

568
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,330
that asshole boyfriend says I know a

569
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,080
shortcut

570
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,639
of course the shortcut could have killed

571
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,129
them without Michael around his fucking

572
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:08,129
spikes on the gate and fucking poison

573
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:11,850
everywhere and shit but eventually uses

574
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,769
the shortcut and that is where the one

575
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:16,739
good scene that I mentioned in the the

576
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:18,419
review I really like the scene where

577
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,789
it's got the motion light detector and

578
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,519
at first a little kid thing he tries to

579
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,230
kiss up on the girl she's like dog just

580
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,609
because I don't like him I'm not with

581
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,710
him anymore than mean I'm with you and

582
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,049
he set up kind of as a joke or a funny

583
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:32,789
guy so you you don't really want him to

584
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,679
die and he's like oh hey he thinks it's

585
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,359
the neighbor a man and you know

586
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,309
Michael's just sitting there staring at

587
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,320
him like Michael does and you know

588
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,190
obviously kills us good and a gruesome

589
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,690
fashion but really tension-filled

590
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,799
fashion because you're like is it gonna

591
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,289
get away I want to get away the light is

592
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,539
going out that kind of creative stuff

593
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,249
that we know so every time the lights go

594
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:55,950
off he's moving they're not supposed to

595
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,320
be motion sensor lights they weren't all

596
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,429
that acted they were walking through the

597
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:01,619
backyard for a while before maybe he

598
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:03,859
knows the range cuz he's pure evil

599
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:09,989
motherfucker the one thing you didn't

600
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,580
know you're gonna you're gonna complain

601
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,929
about that but you're not gonna complain

602
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,480
that the foot later on so then the cops

603
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,509
find her right cuz she's running and

604
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:19,889
screaming away cuz she sees her friend

605
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:22,200
die and then they help her and they put

606
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,909
her in the back of a car and and then

607
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:26,309
and then the cop is just randomly

608
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,499
looking for Michael and finds him and

609
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,480
instead of determining yes that's

610
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,700
Michael he just runs the motherfucker

611
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,049
over it could have been just some dude

612
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:37,139
trick-or-treating like yes porn runs him

613
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:39,289
over you okay with that part but Michael

614
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,539
isn't fazed by this some 78 year-old man

615
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,749
it's not fazed by a fucking police

616
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:50,129
Explorer slamming into him and that sets

617
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,529
up the worst subplot in the whole thing

618
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:54,419
where the doctor that's been studying

619
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,169
Mike Myers for 30 years there's a mr.

620
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:05,809
replacement for the original doctor yeah

621
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:08,700
he decides that he doesn't want the

622
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,200
police officer to kill Michael so he

623
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,559
takes out

624
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,999
little penknife and stabs him in the

625
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:14,399
neck a bunch of times and then he puts

626
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,289
on the mask and wants to be like pretend

627
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:18,240
Michael for a little while to see what

628
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,649
it feels like what it feels like to kill

629
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:22,350
what it feels like to kill and everybody

630
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,990
has this obsession with hearing Michael

631
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,240
speak I don't know what is the obsession

632
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,970
with hearing Michael speak you know but

633
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,460
multiple characters have that and then

634
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,559
he gets oh he kills the police officer

635
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,120
and then throws Michael in the back and

636
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,070
then Michael wakes up and doesn't like

637
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,710
the doctor so he just kills him and then

638
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,779
this whole subplot kind of started and

639
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,369
you think it's gonna be big because you

640
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,749
have a guy that betrayed the police

641
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:47,519
officer that we like maybe he's gonna be

642
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:54,720
the new Michael yeah but no he probably

643
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,320
know probably what happened that's

644
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,759
probably true that's probably what he

645
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,320
did it because member later on he

646
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,940
mentions we've I've never seen Michael

647
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,070
in an uncontrolled environment I want to

648
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,740
I want to witness this yeah but he gets

649
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,749
his ass fucking killed because Michael

650
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:13,379
can apparently kick a steel cop car you

651
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:15,029
know how they imprison people by three

652
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:17,759
days a week of powerlifting at the local

653
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,889
hospital like they got a building big

654
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:26,279
lift big I mean and you steroids low tea

655
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,649
center twice a week there's no

656
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,980
supernatural up in here or maybe because

657
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,809
they mentioned pure evil he's supposed

658
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,240
to be supernatural they go big on late

659
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,429
leg day if you're pure evil I guess so

660
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,889
you know he's chasing her down after

661
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,600
that whole situation happens with his

662
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,249
doctor kills doctor don't care

663
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:45,869
managed to kill two other police

664
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:49,200
officers though they they that was a

665
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,820
cool scene though where he had hollowed

666
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,619
out the guy's skull and put the Maglite

667
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:53,940
up in there so and turned his head into

668
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,320
a jack-o'-lantern yeah that was cool

669
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,970
that's what I liked about this film is

670
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,519
but I wanted to see more we keep seeing

671
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,950
the corpses and we don't see him kill

672
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,600
anybody that's what I mentioned in the

673
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,159
review that's why I said it wasn't glory

674
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,049
upon further reflection there are some

675
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,869
pretty you know nasty after-effects yeah

676
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,700
what happened but they keep that mostly

677
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,249
off-screen and I wanted to see a little

678
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:15,480
more than that because I'm sick in the

679
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,830
head what's the baby today he wants to

680
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,230
see you guys baby to die on screen don't

681
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,630
you be saying that you

682
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,120
roll it back that's one no I thought he

683
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,890
was gonna kill the baby and I thought

684
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,390
the movie needed some kind of injection

685
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,450
to make it darker and evil er but don't

686
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,260
kill the baby on the screen right Oscar

687
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,950
it's okay to kill the baby off screen

688
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,840
kill the baby the first kill was a baby

689
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,850
that little kid was a baby he was like

690
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,990
13 years old

691
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,110
that's a baby okay didn't know what he

692
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,910
was doing and he was saying please and

693
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:55,190
that anyway okay so what else so

694
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,780
eventually you know he's chasing down

695
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,190
the granddaughter and she's running

696
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,030
through the forest

697
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,350
apparently she knows exactly the

698
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,120
direction that her grandma's house is in

699
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,580
goes to it grandma's house is

700
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,680
essentially home alone situation she's

701
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,000
got automatic doors underground you know

702
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,660
bunkers with a bunch of machine guns and

703
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,000
it just pisses me off because there's so

704
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,350
many tropes in this movie it's like oh

705
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,390
shoot him everybody equip themselves

706
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,950
with a weapon this is what you've been

707
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,410
training for for 40 years and they don't

708
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,140
do these things until the very last

709
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,660
minute or she's sticking guns everywhere

710
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,550
you know she searched through her own

711
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,680
house because Michael enters and she's

712
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,180
sticking her guns into the fucking

713
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,890
closet where Michael could just grab the

714
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,380
guns no if you see a blood trail leading

715
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,300
to that you just start fucking firing

716
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,090
into the goddamn closet because it's not

717
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,590
like you give a shit about your house if

718
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,750
you're fucking making it rigging it to

719
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,570
explode later on so it turns out this

720
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,730
little underground bunker is not a cage

721
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,400
where they hide it's really where

722
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,200
they're trying to get Michael in and

723
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,030
then caged up Michael and then they

724
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,340
press a button and it blows them on fire

725
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,630
but it's a slow fire it's not an

726
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,030
explosion and then it kind of burns the

727
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,070
rest of the house down we see Michael

728
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,140
just staring at us with fire behind him

729
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,020
we never see Michael on fire himself and

730
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,150
then it cuts to an understanding cuts

731
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,830
back to him and there's nobody there and

732
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,310
there's fire and that's fucking it that

733
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,200
was that's the fucking resident there's

734
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,370
one more there one more important thing

735
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,840
because you see got out of it obviously

736
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,820
yeah which makes no fucking sense

737
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,130
because there's no fucking way out of

738
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,350
that bunker no apparently she built a

739
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,360
fucking door into that bunker well maybe

740
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,400
he just punches through the ceiling

741
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,300
she knows just floorboards because he's

742
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,320
well she did shoot through the

743
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,040
floorboard pure evil flies up like

744
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,340
Superman doesn't leg day and so he just

745
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,030
jumps through and then just explodes out

746
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,770
so while they do fight each other a

747
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,230
little bit you know she's trying to come

748
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,570
at him with a knife and and I thought

749
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,850
they were really gonna the creative

750
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,290
thing I wanted them to do is make

751
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,900
Michael to pray and her the hunter and

752
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,270
they do a little bit of that where it's

753
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,340
you're it's from your point of view the

754
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,690
audience point of view probably from

755
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,310
Jamie Lee Curtis is character lorries

756
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,980
and Michael's you know walking around

757
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,200
the house looking around for Laurie and

758
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,840
eventually you know she attacks but I

759
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,850
was hoping that they do more of that and

760
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,070
make Michael the victim yeah the one I

761
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,780
like is whenever he through Laurie off

762
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,180
from the same story be and he looks back

763
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,500
down and she disappears they do that

764
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,770
jingle - yeah as a reference - yeah I

765
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,320
should be scared the end of the first

766
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,630
film and the opening credits which is an

767
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,910
image of Michael at that plays the first

768
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,160
film as a kind of hint to let you know

769
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,350
this is the only thing that matters and

770
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,240
then our film begins yeah you got shot a

771
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,010
bunch of times and then just disappeared

772
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,960
and eventually got caught yeah yeah so

773
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,450
what do you think the sequel is going to

774
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,890
be about that I hope that because

775
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,330
they're the last scene of the movie is

776
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,250
them driving away in a truck and the

777
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,080
granddaughters clutching the knife and

778
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,630
she hasn't let it go and it would be

779
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,550
kinda cool I know they're probably not

780
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,930
gonna do it if she kind of becomes a

781
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,940
killer like they've done that before and

782
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,630
for that was four or five where he's two

783
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,540
three four six and eight zero like all

784
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,160
of those don't exist anymore I'll tell

785
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,110
you why she was clutching it and it was

786
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,180
on purpose and it wasn't on purpose to

787
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,010
make her into a killer it was on purpose

788
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,500
now she's just like her mother and she's

789
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,840
just like her grandmother that has this

790
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,330
this tension like aya it's fight or

791
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,700
flight so she's basically turned into

792
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,640
her grandma now and she will do battle

793
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,620
with with Michael in the in the next

794
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,340
film and what are they gonna do I don't

795
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,800
fuckin know I actually don't really care

796
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,350
just because the whole thing was rather

797
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,200
tame the slasher films

798
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,090
they make a comeback after this film I

799
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,740
don't think so I don't think they're

800
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,720
interesting enough this is probably the

801
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,909
best it's going to get and it still is

802
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,980
only able to hit about a six out of ten

803
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,549
from me so I'm not really sure I'm

804
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,169
interested in a sequel though I hear

805
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:08,809
it's tracking very very well going to

806
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:11,960
make October a very popular month well I

807
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,360
was surprised to see that you know we we

808
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,250
looked up on like what wrong tomatoes

809
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,559
had this at and it was really high right

810
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,269
for like just a generic for yeah for

811
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,750
critics yeah I wonder if 89% it's just

812
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,909
finding the ones it's like hey you you

813
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:26,330
know

814
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,980
well they've seen critics have probably

815
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,139
seen all of those motherfucking films

816
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:31,159
from front and they were like you know

817
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,889
what this one not bad and it's Jamie Lee

818
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,559
Curtis you know didn't alright job she's

819
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,659
older now give her this one no one has

820
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:41,090
seen more bad movies like it feels like

821
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,789
they gave this one a pass yeah with the

822
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,470
rating be in that high now granted it is

823
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,019
not a terrible film if you watched it

824
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:49,850
you'd be like okay I watched it but you

825
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,139
wouldn't be like damn that was good I

826
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:52,730
want to see another one or damn that was

827
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,090
an awesome ending you just be like okay

828
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,000
you did a better sequel than kind of all

829
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,529
the rest of them but that ain't saying

830
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:06,260
much it's Mike Myers has never been one

831
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,740
of my top ones I rather see a remake of

832
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,290
Hellraiser maybe I would love to see how

833
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,230
raised but that poor fucking franchise

834
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,690
is owned by like everybody goes fuckin

835
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,579
cheap on it you need to give that to a

836
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:23,060
talented motherfucker with all the new

837
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,069
technology no defects in clay like they

838
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,889
did the first time what about this

839
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,349
crossover film we had Freddy vs. Jason

840
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:37,480
should we see Michael Myers vs. Chuckie

841
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:46,970
no no no Michael Myers vs. pinhead right

842
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,589
he's just gonna get his ass kicked it

843
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:51,710
was a 70 year old man like he can't get

844
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,290
up or sit down I'll be making the noise

845
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,630
you know the noise okay Michael Michael

846
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,890
it's time to stop the mask it's time to

847
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,270
stop

848
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,940
okay it doesn't really go into any more

849
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,590
backstory it doesn't make him a more

850
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,930
interesting character it just continues

851
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,540
with the sort of slow burn that they've

852
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,360
always been and there's no reason to

853
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,820
come back for it so if there's a sequel

854
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,620
shit you know I'm gonna have to drag us

855
