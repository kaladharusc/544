1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,410
hey guys back with our wrap-up of III

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,740
2018 winners and losers Nintendo so this

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,050
will round out the big three Nintendo's

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,349
up next what did you guys think of the

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,570
Nintendo press conference feel like they

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,230
really like smash like it was like 40

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,490
minutes for Nintendo and it was like

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,189
half of it was smelly

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,279
I hear Nintendo all you remember is

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,019
smash because they give such little time

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,719
to the other games and such epic time to

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,120
smash that that's what stands out and

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,059
honestly it is pretty ultimate that the

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,579
freaking version like what 60 characters

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,260
I'm always complaining about hub

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,090
lighting games kind of give us fewer and

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,219
fewer characters here comes you know

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,860
smash ultimate with an insane amount of

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,629
characters amazing every friggin

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,059
character every I'm not gonna smash I'm

21
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,280
not gonna claim I'm a big like play them

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,109
all I've only played you know here and

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,910
there when other people forced me into

24
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,670
it because they want to kick my ass but

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,119
I do have fun when I play so so so

26
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,830
that's strong that's a strong title

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,380
however it is kind of a reboot or a

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,350
remake just enhanced in many many ways

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,780
but it's not they're not reinventing the

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,119
engine and I don't think it's necessary

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,850
to they've improved the graphics quality

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,740
like yeah and exponentially look better

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,689
but that's actually not what we started

34
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,189
so to start the show started the show

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,540
with Damon cross machina which is a 2019

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,270
mecha game looks interesting has good to

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,720
be good rock music but you know not much

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,210
was shown in terms of gameplay it's had

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,070
a trailer for it moving on we had

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,979
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 which is DLC

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,729
content coming out September what's

42
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,290
going on we don't play this we need a

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,090
place they don't do the figures you need

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,159
to be understanding the games like 400

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,649
hours long oh shit there is so much to

46
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,360
do in that game I had friends who

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,009
started playing the day came out and

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,159
they just finished the last week or two

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,360
and they were playing like eight hours a

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,959
day like there's a lot of content that's

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,989
that gets your money's worth so even

52
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,360
more

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,010
content coming soon for that game

54
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,840
September so that's good then they did

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,050
Pokemon let's go Pikachu let's go

56
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,920
Eevee let's go and honestly I'm excited

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,750
for this I was hoping for a full-fledged

58
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,140
new Jack next generation Pokemon game

59
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,400
yes this kind of is a half but it is a

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,240
full brand new so I don't think we're

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,950
getting a Pokemon game for a while

62
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,500
because this is gonna supplement that

63
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,770
and so that's kind of disappointing and

64
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,050
when they show it didn't really show it

65
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,550
off in the best light possible it feels

66
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,990
like it so this should have already been

67
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,290
out or this isn't really the one you're

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,739
waiting for however if you want yeah but

69
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,840
if you watch the treehouse afterwards

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,730
where they're actually playing the game

71
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,280
with the developers and talking about it

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,770
it looks a lot freaking better than I

73
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,959
thought it did and and it's got an

74
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,300
integration with Pokemon you know go

75
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,550
which don't play anymore but I used to

76
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,100
play so that would probably be another

77
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,430
reason for me to go and play it and what

78
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,959
else what else did they show they showed

79
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,420
a new Mario Party no no for pokey man oh

80
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,440
ma a fucking ball thing that was cool

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,940
it's a gimmick but it's cool it is a

82
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,480
gimmick but I'm still not sold like I'm

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,100
not sold on what the Boogie bar or the

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,180
boogey man I'll just wear this switch oh

85
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,580
yes oh wow Joe the switch is on fire I

86
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,010
dunno I'm surprised you're not sold on

87
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,860
it but no I get you well this new titles

88
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,140
that are coming out it seems cool

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,049
I'll wait maybe I'll get a used one yeah

90
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,519
yeah I'm not sure how many use switches

91
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,380
there are I got sargodha billion of kids

92
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,000
if you're on restriction I'm gonna turn

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,920
your console in cuz it's hot right now

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:20,200
this is what I'm talking about

95
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,720
yes yeah but Joe that's because I have

96
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,990
so many games to get through if I if I

97
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,420
was a Nintendo fan I would be super

98
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,970
happy with the switch no I'm trying to

99
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,370
convince you that Nintendo is actually

100
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,140
doing a lot better job with the switch

101
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,660
that I thought that they would and it's

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,000
blowing the Wii U out of the water we oh

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,270
yeah yeah and it's constantly getting

104
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,340
new games to the online store the only

105
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,050
thing they can do is little better on is

106
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,700
like the retro stuff you know they

107
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,280
couldn't starlings been talking about

108
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,390
that but yeah so so switch is sweet and

109
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,430
I play it a lot more if I had more time

110
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,320
because they do have exciting games

111
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,290
moving on to the most exciting for me

112
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,320
from this press conference

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,270
Super Mario Party man I love the party

114
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,450
games and yeah and the last one had this

115
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,430
sort of Bowser thing and it was kind of

116
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,920
different and it changed up the rules

117
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,870
and that was fun for that time but it's

118
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,900
good to seemingly go back to what what

119
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,510
makes Super Mario Party Super Mario

120
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,140
Party or mario party mario party in the

121
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,760
minigames look cool and then get this

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,700
like multiple screen stuff now where if

123
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,170
you have multiple switches you can

124
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,960
create a bigger a bigger playing field

125
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,150
but none of muhfuckas have a switch so I

126
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,550
know y'all just gonna be fuckin usual or

127
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,450
whatever you start using this well Mario

128
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,720
Party I'll use it more you know for a

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,570
day but hey for a few days all right

130
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,510
well we have fun on that then they go on

131
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,660
to fire emblem this one is confusing

132
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,100
because they expected everybody to know

133
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,530
what it was just from the trailer alone

134
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,630
then the ending was like some lady

135
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,360
sitting on a throne with like a little

136
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,400
design of six but it I don't even know

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,140
if that applies I think it was just a

138
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,360
design as I went to fuck gamers this is

139
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,200
a spring 2018 or 19 I remember and cuz I

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,390
guess it's Fire Emblem I'm sure it's

141
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,160
Fire Emblem but they shouldn't fucking

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,750
put the title there for somebody who is

143
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,600
just coming into the fire

144
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,510
yes but but in this one there they're

145
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,460
using like troops and formations and

146
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,080
stuff in addition to the arrows running

147
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,460
around and having their own you know

148
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,650
attack capabilities now they're rolling

149
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,790
with a Retina Trek toon yeah and and so

150
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,640
that looks sweet and I love strategy

151
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,560
games and that's one that I'll screw

152
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,450
around with when I go on trips on the

153
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,800
planes is it like one of those old

154
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,000
tactic games yeah good I'm looking

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,230
forward to that one that was a strong

156
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,720
one they went in announced that right

157
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
now on your switch you can play for

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:07,780
tonight because you sandy you talking

159
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,290
about

160
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,350
battle royale too damn much and pug gee

161
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,820
I'm never playing these fucking games

162
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,100
and then they pay me and then I play I

163
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,680
do probably want to eventually try I

164
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,320
can't believe I've been resisting it for

165
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,390
so I was in the same boat I don't want

166
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,790
to play it because everybody else plays

167
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,250
and it just feels like this this cheap

168
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,800
way to get views and they get popularity

169
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,570
and it's not popular for a reason

170
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,760
exactly so that's why I need to look at

171
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,340
it in a different way Joe yes millions

172
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,750
and millions of people playing it but

173
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,600
they're not brainwashed by marketing I

174
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,270
mean so dice is super critical about

175
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,910
these sorts of games and he is freaking

176
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,650
hooked on it now because he says the

177
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,690
skill ceiling is so ludicrously high if

178
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,490
you're good there's no magic hacking so

179
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,750
you're always playing against people who

180
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,340
are well if the skills good see that

181
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,590
that is a discouragement for me a lot a

182
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,870
fortnight's side because with the skill

183
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,580
ceiling that yeah building in addition

184
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,070
to fighting when I'm we're fucking

185
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,660
artificially going up a fuckin thing

186
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,070
while you're building it while you're

187
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,550
shooting is like oh shit but luckily 99%

188
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,990
of people that play the game are stupid

189
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,550
and you could just shoot you shoot them

190
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,090
and kill them

191
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,680
well you're not win a match because

192
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,410
there's gonna be one of those maybe

193
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,760
you're lose

194
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,300
Yeah right at the end of the day guys I

195
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,270
think this year I'm like I might

196
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,200
eventually have to try this Joe plays 49

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,610
or something like that

198
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,590
yeah all right anyways it's available in

199
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,050
switch right now and I got to stop

200
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,890
hating on battle royale

201
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,100
[Music]

202
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,540
I've dabbled tonight and when we went to

203
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,520
Dreamhack and I saw it on the big stage

204
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,380
it was actually pretty cool for puff G

205
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,270
but that could have just been because

206
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,680
these were the best teams in the country

207
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,530
and they're losers and it was commentary

208
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,130
it was a cool setup when I'm at my home

209
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:11,460
of it all right moving on so then they

210
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,650
showed a few indie titles they had like

211
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,930
overcooked - which is I've never played

212
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,700
the first one but I hear people like it

213
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,180
Killer Bee which I see it pin balls you

214
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,500
know it's a little arcade game I'm

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,750
surprised they managed to get the arcade

216
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,640
game experience onto console because

217
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,230
there's like what eight twelve players

218
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,410
or something like that and so cool and

219
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,540
you know I've never feel like spending

220
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,000
fucking five dollars playing that shit

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
cuz I know it costs a lot or something

222
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,830
like that and you want like four bucks

223
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,930
and then you got to get multiple people

224
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,280
together it's hard to get that many

225
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,200
people in the arcade these days because

226
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,410
the price - yeah yeah unless you want to

227
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,580
play with random people and that's fine

228
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,250
so for to actually get it on the console

229
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,080
and on the switch okay

230
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,970
I'm down I'll play it online and we'll

231
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,250
see how awesome it is and then there's

232
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,040
octo path traveler which is this you

233
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,110
know JRPG and I've seen it in some other

234
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,670
shows I think we've seen it in the

235
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,790
square Square Enix show but um it's got

236
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,560
this unique art style you know the

237
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,570
backgrounds are like blurred and and

238
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,070
it's kind of got a little bit of a toy

239
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,650
look but it's got retro graphics it's

240
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,300
got a neat color palette I think for me

241
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,310
is an interesting color palette the

242
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,370
demos out there's already a demo there's

243
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,860
gonna be a new demo I think recently no

244
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,840
that new demos out and this thing comes

245
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
out July 13 so it's real real soon I'm

246
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,880
not into JRPGs so I don't think I'll

247
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,160
review it or anything but maybe we'll do

248
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,900
what do you mean doing anything to

249
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,630
tendo's hard that's not Nintendo prop oh

250
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,460
okay that's that's third party I think

251
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,680
so yeah it is third party it's a Square

252
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,560
Enix guys anyways after that they did a

253
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,420
sizzle reel with lots of stuff that's

254
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,310
hard for me to catch say but here are

255
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,370
the highlights for me startling and they

256
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,740
they announced Star Fox which is really

257
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,160
cool so these fucking toys actually got

258
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,900
my hands on it at the sort of Ubisoft

259
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,330
booth but they didn't have you know Star

260
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,560
Fox that you could do there you have to

261
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,360
go to the Nintendo booth and or give

262
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,640
them man I didn't I didn't end up

263
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,770
getting into the Nintendo booth so I

264
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,180
couldn't get my hands on the Star Fox

265
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,940
toys so but imma buy that shit because I

266
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,800
love miniatures and I love you know and

267
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,960
it's pre painted like our game so is it

268
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,060
gonna be like an amiibo thing cuz when

269
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,530
they first showed that off last year

270
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,720
they were like oh - unless these ships

271
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,550
you have to buy extra shit and I was

272
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,770
like fuck you like you can't make me pay

273
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,440
60 bucks for a game and then go buy $30

274
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,680
models friend game fucking ships none at

275
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,660
all it works in game well it's it's a

276
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,070
spiral thing is this amiibo well here's

277
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,110
that here's the angle I'm coming from as

278
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,450
you know an older guy now I mean I don't

279
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,310
play with toys but I used to play with

280
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,950
toys and for me as a kid I'm gonna buy

281
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,510
those toys anyway because they're

282
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,950
fucking sweet so I'm just gonna buy

283
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,040
those toys I mean you know and then oh

284
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,980
but shit it also click click click blue

285
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,440
quickly and it has interactivity with

286
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,480
the game now I understand from hardcore

287
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,230
gamers like you motherfuckers get rid of

288
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,300
that shit in the fun bit I see I don't

289
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,830
know if they've changed that since then

290
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,480
like you buy the ships without buying

291
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,950
the models but I was worried because

292
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,090
it's like if you're paying full price

293
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,570
and then you're expected to pay 30 20 30

294
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,370
dollars for ships in a game you just

295
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,650
paid full price for it's like no I'm

296
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,120
gonna play something else I don't have

297
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,640
five five five six yeah good question I

298
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,400
I am can't believe I didn't think to ask

299
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,230
that Wow I'm gonna do him a job

300
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,840
correctly I think that you can unlock

301
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,870
them in the game though I hope

302
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,480
really all right guys intercutting here

303
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,279
because I want to do my job the best I

304
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,170
can you know I wanted so I I have an

305
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,630
official answer I asked them via Twitter

306
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,180
and email the senior manager of public

307
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
relations over there oh do be soft I

308
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,010
relayed the question and he says you can

309
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,200
access and finish the full game with

310
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,870
just the starter pack just the game with

311
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,779
the with the toy the additional physical

312
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,339
toys that you can buy separately just

313
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,620
add to the player experience and let you

314
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,779
get more creative with the little packs

315
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:15,190
that you create in the ships that you

316
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,470
crave but and the way you chant approach

317
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,080
to the game but the ships and weapons

318
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,200
will be accessible digitally without the

319
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,170
need to purchase the physical toys so no

320
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,970
need to worry about they thought about

321
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,700
that and so yeah so it's it's a moot

322
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,890
point but it was a it was a legitimate

323
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,230
point and and something that I didn't

324
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,660
ask but we got figured out for you here

325

starter set and I want I will buy an

327
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,360
additional starfox toy just because I

328
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,310
love the freaking starfox and toys so

329
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,790
yeah alright guys that's it in no world

332
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,040
email see if I can get a reply fast and

333
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,390
I'll put it in the comment section of

334
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,700
this video if I if I can get a reply so

335
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,120
but I am it's a it's a game for kids and

336
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
and when I played it it is definitely

337
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,980
kid oriented you but it's actually

338
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,290
really kind of cool you need to fly in

339
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,209
from planet to planet it was fun and

340
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,130
there you go you can either do hover

341
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,140
right above the ground or fly and you're

342
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,910
fighting bosses and the bosses have

343
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,220
unique attacks and and vulnerable points

344
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,959
and stuff but I can see it being a

345
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,370
little bit repetitive because you're

346
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,930
going from plan and plan and basically

347
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,240
doing the same thing over and over so

348
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,330
I'm not like stellar Lee like excited

349
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,490
for it but I'll be like I play it you

350
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,279
talking my buy a toy to for display

351
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,320
definitely starfox we go plant it to

352
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,450
point it to point it yeah oh so it would

353
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,450
get repetitive ok well these are these

354
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,450
are scripted planets are built planets

355
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,100
with stuff on them instead of you know

356
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,840
okay procedurally

357
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,480
planets okay so that was a lot of time

358
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,010
to vote it to something that Nintendo

359
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,630
barely shows so I can't give them too

360
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,950
much credit there we could talk more

361
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,040
about that in Ubisoft then DBZ or the

362
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,440
Dragon Ball fight or Z's coming so

363
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,940
that's pretty surprising cuz I'm not

364
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,160
really sure how I feel about you

365
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,630
wouldn't be using it like this you'd

366
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,570
have to get it bro control they also

367
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,310
showed off that new GameCube controller

368
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,960
they're bringing back the game over

369
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,240
right right and then there's and then

370
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,670
Just Dance is coming Ark is coming as

371
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,190
wasteland 2 is surprising that's coming

372
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,350
to the console I never played wasteland

373
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,240
2 and I was curious to whether it was

374
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,720
good or not it was good I just never

375
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,110
played it ok ok so that's it for the

376
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,960
sizzle reel of lots of different stuff

377
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,760
so we move on to the bulk of the show

378
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,100
which is super super smash brothers

379
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,440
ultimate and honestly we've all right

380
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,700
we've already talked about it a little

381
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,880
bit and we're excited for it um I want

382
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,640
to play and I think all these brand new

383
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,770
characters is gonna create a meta game

384
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,810
that's crazy make sure you try to have

385
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,030
that many characters and somebody will

386
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,830
counter somebody else and then somebody

387
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,810
be good against this person man it seems

388
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,760
like a nightmare hopefully they have a

389
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,980
lot of developers working on this a long

390
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,050
time I mean they've changed enough

391
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,880
mechanics to with like the air dodging

392
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,380
and the dodging stamina and stuff

393
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,870
they're like The Meadows will shift

394
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,760
drastically and the people that are

395
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,650
playing in tournaments is gonna be crazy

396
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,620
watch I can't believe I forgot it so

397
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,900
they're adding a character that most

398
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,910
people were talking about like that

399
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,089
they'd never think they'd add but Ridley

400
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,370
Ridley is really it was really he's the

401
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,050
boss from one of the Metroid games the

402
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,360
giant dragon guy ok interesting cool

403
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,459
emesis mean and then isn't isn't like

404
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,140
other characters in this now like a

405
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,080
snake snakes backs thanks he was a long

406
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,459
time was in it so snakes bags okay man

407
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,080
I'm really excited and looking forward

408
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,440
to it so so really solid showing from

409
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,709
Nintendo with some games but because it

410
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,839
was so short and because it was so super

411
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,450
smash brothers ultimate dominant I felt

412
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,649
like that

413
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,409
it wasn't as exciting as it could have

414
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,870
been it wasn't as as strong as it could

415
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,299
have been it was solid but but not not

416
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,039
not quite strong so what do you think

417
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,630
what is your final verdict

418
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,600
so Nintendo technically on a technical

419
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,860
standpoint did it great they didn't have

420
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,240
any issues and I thought that the

421
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,770
transitions were really good and the

422
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,480
videos matched up and they got their

423
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,839
editing done IndieGoGo right so from a

424
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,990
hype standpoint though depending on how

425
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,789
much you were into smash because I have

426
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,640
friends that went fucking ballistic when

427
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,130
they saw the smash thing from that from

428
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,529
their perspective the Nintendo show can

429
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:41,620
kill you and whine yeah for me I mean I

430
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,779
can appreciate that they're putting that

431
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,490
much effort into smash I know this which

432
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,470
is a huge platform and they're adding a

433
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,700
lot more to it but they didn't really

434
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,110
bring anything new to the table like

435
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,419
crazy revolutionary I mean if they would

436
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,010
come out and be like you know Odyssey 2

437
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,630
or something like crazy like that or

438
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,070
another breath of the wild type of thing

439
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,630
it would have been a lot higher but for

440
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,520
me it ended at about a 7 you know it was

441
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,010
a good conference I was it was a good

442
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,169
conference it wasn't a bad conference it

443
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,760
didn't have any issues and I'm like you

444
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,980
know the other conferences it didn't

445
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,570
have like a huge mind-blowing amount of

446
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,340
games but it was good and for people

447
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,320
that loved smash it's fantastic yeah

448
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,270
there's really only like 11 big bullet

449
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,399
points and then not counting the sizzle

450
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,010
reel so far fewer than other press

451
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,880
conferences

452
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,760
almost even fewer than the disaster that

453
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,919
was Square Enix but we'll talk about

454
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:27,760
that later

455
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,429
Joe what would you give Nintendo how do

456
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,190
you feel about it for this good one for

457
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,049
you yeah cuz I was really hoping it

458
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,179
would be like alright now you convinced

459
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,059
me to buy well not just happen but I

460
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,919
wanted them to convince me to pick up a

461
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,409
switch but like dole said there wasn't a

462
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,750
lot of games I really use it more Joe if

463
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,610
you had your own switch and we can place

464
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,029
which together with Pokemon let's go

465
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:57,970
let's go this battle yeah you remember

466
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,730
in fucking line in fucking middle school

467
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,490
and a fucking game boys you know we can

468
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,159
recreate that shit yes a fucking liquor

469
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,070
Joe I'm telling you you gotta buy a buy

470
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,190
one waste your money for one game

471
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,600
they never blade again because we're

472
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,029
gonna play on am I gonna play offline

473
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,820
he's pretty excited about smash that's a

474
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,340
great game I'm not like overly hyped

475
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,200
about it oh yeah no you know you're not

476
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,970
going ballistic like some people yeah

477
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,649
and Mario Party that would be pretty fun

478
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,279
too but if I get my friends to play with

479
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,929
me which is kind of limited at this

480
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,879
point right yeah I'm still pretty

481
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,320
excited about it it's still pretty cool

482
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,799
showcase I liked it but I'm with della

483
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,549
at a7 okay but see that's higher than

484
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,720
you you rated that higher than my

485
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,039
croissant so yeah yeah and so so did

486
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,600
better than Sony in terms of

487
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,220
presentation because we have to if we're

488
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,480
factoring and remember we're factoring

489
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,509
presentation with the games so for me

490
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,730
the games were it was a little light a

491
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,679
little light you know the only thing I

492
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,409
was super excited about is Super Mario

493
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:13,929
Party and smash you know Pokemon yes so

494
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,179
so really three games yeah but when you

495
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,519
got three games and I have the system

496
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,259
already and everything else that they

497
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,519
showed off it's like yeah you're doing

498
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,200
your job great but but it wasn't like I

499
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,029
had felt previous Nintendo press

500
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:33,850
conferences just being much better yeah

501
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,070
so it so it just didn't have that and

502
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,309
and Super Smash Brothers ultimate since

503
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,830
I'm not into that scene and I'm not good

504
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,870
at the game it's I'm not that excited

505
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,059
for it I'm I want to play it but I'm not

506
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,879
sure overly hyped and then Super Mario

507
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,409
Party is something that we'll play a few

508
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,269
times on stream have a good time and

509
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,070
then we move on but it's not unlike none

510
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,690
of those mega hitters like breath of the

511
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,970
wild were you like I cannot wait to get

512
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,529
this oh my god exactly right Pokemon is

513
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,779
the is gonna be cool if you get one if

514
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:10,289
you don't get one of you like nobody

515
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:16,259
with you so for me I I think Nintendo

516
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,210
man but I don't think I can rate it

517
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,700
higher than Microsoft because Microsoft

518
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,059
is showing off 50 games and planting to

519
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:25,450
see

520
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,880
for the future and they had there two or

521
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,210
three heavy hitters just like Nintendo

522
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,669
had and because it was so short and

523
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,740
because it was so focused on one game

524
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,470
that I wasn't you know that hyped on I'm

525
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,000
probably gonna say yeah it was an

526
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,159
average job is an average and I know

527
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,350
your Nintendo fanboys gonna kill me

528
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,330
because I'm gonna give it a five and on

529
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,090
my scale that's average is an average

530
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,340
you know press conference I'm not all

531
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,470
that much more hype than I'm not all

532
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,779
that and dis encouraged by what I saw

533
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,870
and what's coming for the switch but

534
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,779
here's how you get Joe to go up to a 6 7

535
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:07,659
8 9 10 for Nintendo press conference and

536
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,220
that would be if they announced stuff

537
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,080
like you know what you know we're all

538
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,330
community focused now we're no longer

539
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,320
gonna come after youtubers and you guys

540
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,570
can share as much as you want with your

541
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,380
friends share everything about Nintendo

542
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,909
you know some Nintendo corporate guys

543
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:34,240
gonna watch that be like yeah so I well

544
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,799
the only reason why I gave it a 5 is

545
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,870
because I felt like Sony's games were

546
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,700
stronger although its presentation was

547
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,860
weaker and and Microsoft's game

548
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,559
presentation was stronger though its

549
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,559
games were what you expect

550
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,750
just like what you expect for Nintendo

551
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,059
so until you come out with that heavy

552
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,399
hitter you know maybe Metroid or some

553
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:57,010
you know something like that or Super

554
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,850
Mario like they had last time it was an

555
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,409
all right guys all right so we drag this

556
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:04,870
out quite a long time for Nintendo even

557
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,399
though it's super short thank you so

558
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,440
