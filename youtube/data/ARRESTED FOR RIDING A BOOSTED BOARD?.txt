1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190

9
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,350
how to navigate the stress out and i thought that i would just talk about it

10
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,870
to my therapist which is all of you

11

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,850
an entire week's worth of work into one day because tomorrow is a travel day

13

well sort of yeah here's the thing that not a lot of expect

61
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,460

yeah I believe in the rule of law

67
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,409
I really genuinely do except when you don't think the rules are just

68
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,370
and that's unjust that I can ride in the middle of a freeway and that's okay but

69
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,000
i can't ride on a path that's meant for wheeled vehicles

70
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,750
yeah

71
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:49,800
