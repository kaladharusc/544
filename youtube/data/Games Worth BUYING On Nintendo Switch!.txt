1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,740
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,419
YouTube's boogie2988 coming at your

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,799
levels get through the power of the

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,569
Internet every time I stream on Twitch

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,670
people ask me boogie I just got a brand

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,950
new console or a brand-new gaming PC I

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,320
want to know what games I should get for

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,700
that console or for that PC what

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,520
exclusives our must plays and I figured

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,900
I would do an entire console series

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,850
based on each different platforms

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,260
starting today with the Nintendo switch

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,850
before we get into the games though I

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,439
know a lot of people gonna ask boogie is

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,580
it even worth picking up a Nintendo

16
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,650
switch and I have to say I love mine I

17
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,260
play mine almost every single day now

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,850
it's true third-party support continues

19
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,110
to suck and the hardware is not that

20
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,530
powerful

21
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,719
but the portability of that is really

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,219
amazing and there's enough first party

23
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,719
game store if you played just those

24
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,250
first party games just two or three of

25
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,840
them you're gonna be happy you bought

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,760
the system if you're a fan of indie

27
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,410
games and you're fan of smaller games

28
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,090
you want to play stuff like dead cells

29
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,289
and some of the other indie games I'm

30
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,820
gonna mention here later on in the list

31
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,190
I think it's absolutely the best place

32
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,350
to play most of those games especially

33
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,480
smaller indie games with retro feels and

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,820
retro graphics it really is it's an

35
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,920
amazing system I highly recommend one so

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,940
let's start off with The Legend of Zelda

37
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,129
breath of the wild which is I think the

38
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,570
number one game that you should get for

39
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,619
the system is certainly the most

40
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,110
critically acclaimed game on the system

41
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,330
of the highest rating as it absolutely

42
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,640
should be I know you're thinking I

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
boogie I've never played a Zelda game

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,700
before am I gonna be lost no this isn't

45
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,409
definitely a great place to start

46
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,150
boogie I played a Zelda games before I

47
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,549
don't like them this is very different

48
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,740
from a Zelda game it plays a lot more

49
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,439
like a Skyrim variant because of the

50
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,000
cooking and the world exploration in the

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,409
open world and the way that you can do

52
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,450
things in any order however you want to

53
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,250
do them and and that's just for starters

54
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,619
I personally put a hundred hours into

55
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,970
this game and still didn't find

56
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,350
everything and do everything there was

57
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,909
to do in the game though I did complete

58
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,710
the main storyline but even for somebody

59
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,000
who completes the main storyline there's

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,409
still plenty of stuff to do afterwards

61
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,229
as well as a new game plus mode known as

62
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,909
the master Quest and then of course

63
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,399
there's the DLC which I still haven't

64
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,570
touched and at some point I'm going to

65
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,159
go back and play the harder version of

66
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,110
the game and go through the DLC in all

67
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,270
the trials I just have to find another

68
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,219
time to put a hundred more hours into

69
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,500
the same game worth it though absolutely

70
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,240
this if you bought just this game alone

71
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
and then threw your Nintendo switch away

72
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,379
after you were done I think you probably

73
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,819
got your money's worth and then there's

74
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,290
Super Mario Odyssey which is another

75
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,680
system

76
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,569
solar again I think if you don't like

77
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,980
platforming games if you don't like

78
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,540
mario games you won't like this but if

79
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,430
you've ever enjoyed anything like that

80
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,890
there's a ton of stuff here for you it

81
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,469
plays a lot like Super Mario 64 except

82
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,120
with updated graphics and updated sounds

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,739
and a much bigger game with a lot more

84
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,950
stuff to do in it three different

85
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,849
endings you know there's like a very

86
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,709
casual ending that's fairly easy to get

87
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,420
and much more difficult ending and then

88
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,889
there's like a surprise thing that you

89
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,930
can unlock if you decide to get the

90
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,329
maximum number of stars a good number of

91
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,859
worlds here and a lot of stuff to do and

92
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:45,870
it's not your traditional Mario game in

93
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,579
that there's like multiplayer modes

94
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,409
through the balloon system where people

95
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,579
can hide balloons and you could try to

96
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,349
find them so it gets you some level of

97
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,150
replayability there's a ton of costumes

98
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,939
and stuff to unlock you could easily put

99
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,859
50 60 hours into this game I think I

100
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,719
personally only put about 20 or 30 into

101
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,159
it and I still boot it up every once in

102
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,079
a while for balloon mode because I'm not

103
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,099
a completionist but if you're a

104
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,049
completionist you can really sink your

105
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,519
teeth into this game and I would think

106
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,870
it's well worth the price of entry

107
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,549
then there's Bayonetta 2 which is an

108
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,189
action combat game unlike anything else

109
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,239
and here's the thing if you buy a

110
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,530
physical version of this you're gonna

111
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,930
get Bayonetta 1 digital download code

112
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,090
with it so there even if you missed the

113
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,709
first game you can go back and play the

114
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,209
first one you probably won't though

115
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,590
you'll probably only play Bayonetta 2

116
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,540
because once you start up Bayonetta -

117
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,250
it's hard to go back to play 1 because 2

118
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,280
is considerably better but 2 is just

119
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
mind-boggling ly good the very first

120
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,139
boss fight of this game which is

121
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,689
services the tutorial level is better

122
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,669
than some of the boss fights in in the

123
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,560
game for a lot of other Studios this is

124
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,629
just a ridiculously good game and it's

125
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:46,799
unlike something you would expect to see

126
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,970
on the Nintendo switch because there's

127
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,829
still a lot of sexiness a lot of eye

128
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,169
candy a lot of really cool stuff in this

129
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,540
game it's just dark and it's twisted and

130
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,509
it's weird and it's very Japanese if you

131
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,310
like that kind of thing but I highly do

132
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,569
recommend this game you should watch

133
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,769
somebody play it first to see if it's

134
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,269
your thing but if you like actually

135
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,720
Kombat II weird combo tile style combat

136
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,060
against angels and demons this is the

137
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,040
way to go I debated whether or not to

138
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,840
put octa path traveler on this list but

139
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,280
it's my list and this is one of my

140
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,320
favorite games on the switch I did put

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,970
about 60 hours into it and I still

142
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,060
haven't completed it but if you don't

143
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,289
like this type of game you're definitely

144
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,849
not gonna like out to path traveler you

145
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,360
have to like the old-school 8-bit JRPG

146
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,699
turn-based style job system kind of

147
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,039
thing going on if you do you're really

148
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,689
going to enjoy this game though it's a

149
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,879
bit grindy the storyline is a bit weak

150
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,400
but the combat is fantastic the the boss

151
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,560
fights are incredible in exhilarating

152
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,840
and there's just a ridiculously large

153
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,729
amount of stuff to do if you enjoy the

154
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,229
old Final Fantasy style games that are

155
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,659
on the NES and snis this is a game for

156
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,580
you if you didn't skip it though

157
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,469
then there's Mario Kart 8 and again if

158
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:53,909
you don't like Mario Kart or you don't

159
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,620
like racing games you may not like this

160
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,110
one but if you do it's an easy just

161
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,689
no-brainer to pick this game up it's

162
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,969
probably the best mario karts to date

163
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,710
even if you don't like all the mechanics

164
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,569
that are in it you prefer double dash or

165
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,560
something like that it's still

166
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,270
definitely worth picking up a ton of

167
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,310
content here a ridiculously large number

168
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,560
of modes to play a huge number of tracks

169
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,509
a ton of characters all the DLC from the

170
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,430
Ryu version is here with a few

171
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,259
quality-of-life tweaks to make the game

172
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,900
look even better on the Nintendo switch

173
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,250
again if you love Mario Kart if you love

174
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,020
racing games I think this is an auto

175
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,610
include if you're picking up a Nintendo

176
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,379
switch it's just a solid port so

177
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,939
splatoon - made it to this list and I

178
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,219
have to say it's with a warming the

179
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,889
multiplayer is often ruined by cheating

180
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,409
now it's not entirely rampant especially

181
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,669
at lower ranks and stuff like that but

182
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,139
eventually you will run into cheaters

183
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,000
who screw up the game for you and it's

184
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
kind of frustrating

185
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,520
ever since the Nintendo switch got

186
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,139
hacked that's been an issue and the

187
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,940
community continues to cry about it but

188
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,650
there's nothing Nintendo is really doing

189
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,520
about it because I don't think they

190
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,229
really fully understand the problem or

191
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,729
even know what to do about it

192
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,349
that said the single-player content here

193
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,139
is ok it albeit very light but there's a

194
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,389
ton of guns a ton of weapons a ton of

195
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,889
character customization that you can

196
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,139
unlock here no micro transactions or BS

197
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,819
or anything like that and there's just a

198
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,589
ton of stuff to do the game is very very

199
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:10,229
good I just I want you to know going

200
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,029
ahead of it cheaters will ruin the game

201
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,310
every once in a while just be warned and

202
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,439
then finally there's Mario Plus Rabbids

203
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,000
Kingdom battle which is an absurdly

204
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,710
unique game now it's a tactical

205
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,139
turn-based strategy game similar to like

206
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,849
Final Fantasy Tactics or just Gaea

207
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,550
something along that lines very solid

208
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,349
graphics and it takes place in the Mario

209
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,050
universe with Rabbids invading it so you

210
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,639
get this rank really weird

211
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,710
tongue-in-cheek feeling with some really

212
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,630
unique boss fights and you get all your

213
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,089
favorite characters from Mario the DLC I

214
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,560
think includes Sonic as well though I

215
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,100
haven't

216
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,570
just and play the DLC so fair warning I

217
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,160
don't know if it's any good but this is

218
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,260
a very unique game if you like tactical

219
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,810
games if you like the XCOM style games I

220
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,090
think you're going to love this one it's

221
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,490
a very very solid version of that and

222
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,290
it's just cute as hell too and those are

223
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,750
the big splashy $60 games that I think

224
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,370
everybody will think of when they think

225
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,110
of an antenna switch but I still don't

226
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,250
think that's where the Nintendo switch

227
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,040
shines I think it's the 10 20 $30 games

228
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,890
the indie games the smaller games some

229
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,660
that have a retro feel some that feel

230
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,820
very modern that are just unique and

231
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,590
amazing that feel at home on the system

232
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,000
and some are exclusive to the Nintendo

233
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,490
switch some reports that are also on PC

234
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,440
and Xbox and elsewhere but they just

235
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,780
feel right on the Nintendo switch and

236
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,580
I'm not gonna go into great detail on

237
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,720
indie games because I know a lot of

238
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,850
people don't care about them but I want

239
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,050
to show you just some of the great games

240
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,030
that you can see on the system so here's

241
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,830
a list starting off with the Celeste

242
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,090
which is available in almost every

243
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,740
system but it fills at home on the

244
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,240
Nintendo switch because it really does

245
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,370
lend itself to portability and I think

246
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,470
it's perfect there as this sonic mania

247
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,720
plus it just feels at home on a Nintendo

248
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,090
console dad sells probably one of my

249
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,190
favorite games of the year I think it's

250
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,570
probably to be my top 10 list and I've

251
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,950
only played it on the Nintendo switch I

252
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,660
know it's available elsewhere but it

253
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,030
lends itself to short 20 minute 30

254
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,460
bursts to play times so it's really

255
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,230
decent on a portable system

256
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,450
Halla Nights is of course amazing as

257
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,310
well shovel knight treasure trove

258
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,140
another game that I think if you haven't

259
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,460
played shovel knight you probably should

260
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,650
and again it feels like a Nintendo

261
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,270
switch game because of the retro

262
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,430
graphics seaworld egg 2 is another game

263
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,890
I can highly recommend it's just it's

264
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,260
fun to play it's relaxing and it's got a

265
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,760
really interesting story that I think

266
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,130
you'll get into I think you'll dig it

267
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,470
it started out valley also feels really

268
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,180
home in the Nintendo switch because it's

269
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,610
portable as do roguelikes like enter the

270
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,770
dungeon of course binding of issac which

271
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,090
is not on the list but I think you

272
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,099
absolutely should lean into and there's

273
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,660
still plenty of first party and third

274
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,490
party games big games that we didn't go

275
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,919
over in this video but like I said for

276
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,469
some reason the indie games just feel at

277
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,390
home on the Nintendo switch especially

278
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,440
because it's portable

279
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,700
alright guys that's gonna do it for this

280
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,110
video I hope I've convinced you to buy a

281
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,280
Nintendo switch because it's a great

282
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,350
system and I really really enjoyed mine

283
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,730
if you enjoy the video let me know in

284
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,320
the comments section below let me know

285
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,820
what games I should include on a Sony

286
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,570
version

287
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,180
PC version an Xbox version maybe we'll

288
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,470
even do a mobile version and if you

289
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,000
enjoy this video and you want me to do a

290
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,890
follow-up for the indie games on the

291
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,320
Nintendo switch we absolutely will and

292
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,700
maybe we'll do a follow-up to this one

293
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,890
we have some new big first party games

294
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,750
the third party games for the Nintendo

295
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,360
switch guys as always thanks for

296
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,760
watching I love it very much I'll speak

297
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,000
with you again soon
