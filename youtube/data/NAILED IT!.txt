thank you

54
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,360
official review movie was amazing i highly recommend seeing it

55
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,200
some of the most inventive cinematography ever seen Leo deserves

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,249
the oscar

57
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:22,689
but it was not a perfect movie I thought that the movie itself was better than

58
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,649
the story and that's what everybody in the escalators were leaving was saying

59
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:29,259
is that the story was kind of lightweight and the movie was like this

60
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,329
cinematic triumph that was an absolute like it was it was great

61
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:41,619
do you want to add that no that is a thorough review revenue is a visible

62
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:46,419
ghost or animated corpse that was believed to return from the grave to

63
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,609
terrorize the living

64
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,609
that makes sense

65
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,440
we're trying to go to the sushi place but they weren't serving dinner until

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,060
six so we came to spray in place instead

67
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,710
Oh in order everything on the menu

68
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,710
hungry and angry

69
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,430
phone is taking Francine on a walkabout around the restaurant to keep her busy

70
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,800
he's a good big brother this is just ridiculous here

71
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,100
that's like five dinners

72
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:48,740
I was dinner good ready for bath time in bed that time that time it was 27 when

73
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,980
we started 50 right now it's a it's a dry call
