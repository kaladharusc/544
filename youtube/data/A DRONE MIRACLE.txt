11
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,640
and I need to go retrieve it now I'm not dumb i knew i was inviting all kinds of

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,930
trolling by telling the world where my drone was and then it's just sitting

13
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,170
there and supervise

14
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,840

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,000
it's just super typical troll activity this is a shot of their drone with a

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,830
hook on it as if they went and got my grown and let me say that's impossible

61
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,750
ok I can't give him one of the new ones I already promised to give those away

62
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,310
but

63
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,780
yeah

64
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,080
I got my old phantom to drone here with extra propellers two extra batteries

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,310
controller and in this case this way you guys give me back my broken drone

66
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:32,460
I did you the road cool that I would have given him one of the new phantom 4

67
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,740
is here but I can't

68
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,580
I promise it give those a see you guys later thank you again for coming by i

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,850
wish i could tell you where those guys were from they were so awesome

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,560
now is the moment of truth does this thing still worked

71
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,510
oh it's all corroded I'm gonna start by saying that this footage works

72
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,630
so far nothing

73
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,350
it's just not shown up all rights the memory cards pride

74
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,570
i'm going to try one more reader okay so far so bad the memory card will not

75
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,140
mount my hopes are not high for this drone

76
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,440
there's like mildew on the inside of this thing

77
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,480
all right i want to just lower everyone's expectations right now

78
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,050
this is probably not going to work

79
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,449
yeah

80
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,520
is not supposed to be doing that what I want to do is see if i can connect the

81
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,360
controller to the drone at all right

82
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,289
it's going reserved but it is connected

83
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,630
alright still saying cannot take off but it's not telling me why why

84
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:06,039
yeah

85
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,600
let's watch it blow your honor bret for 10 days

86
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,720
who take her outside i believe i can fly

87
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,639
i believe i considered the sky

88
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,090
not

89
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,090
I swear my way

90
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,310
here we go

91
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,770
there we go

92
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:45,020
here we go I'm not gonna lie the pictures a little on the crazy side

93
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,039
it's like shaking a little bit

94
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,129
let's see how this thing and fly ok

95
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,090
the picture is going crazy no no no it's crazy

96
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,190
my thinking is that like yes it still works but the gimbal is a little like

97
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,389
drunk

98
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,479
it's like the home drone you've had too much to drink

99
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,020
I'm bringing it in

100
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:17,419
I mean that is ridiculous that this thing still works

101
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,879
BAM drone number two now I know that footage was a little bit less than

102
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,279
perfect and i'm not one to disappoint

103
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,610
just in case I brought drone number three just in case throw number two

104
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,110
wasn't perfect

105
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,190
so today's episode is going to end with some beautiful cinematography of the

106
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,190
Hudson River

107
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:55,209
yeah

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
yeah

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,130
ok it's like six in the morning i totally forgot that I had to pick a

110
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,170
winner for today from yesterday it so I didn't shoot it and I want to get in ok

111
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,480
know that we pick this one are completely randomly so it doesn't matter

112
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,170
like what this what you said in the comments just just random

113
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:42,110
ok today's winner of the drone is is Nuri Maria right

114
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,730
this is you and this is your channel i sent you a message

115
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,630
well i sent you a secret message so just follow the instructions as laid out in

116
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,080
YouTube and that's messed up
