I really can't feel bad about spending just a little bit of my afternoon

68
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,580
mapping being on a plane for two days straight without having a proper bed to

69
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,600
lay down and it's punishing so just I'm just taking a little bit of advantage of

70
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
this opportunity

71
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:21,029
I've got an hour left before I believe this hotel room considering it looks

72
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,870
like somebody tried to rob the place i should probably spend this time hacking

73
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,960
but again I gotta sit on a plane

74
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm getting to get a running this pretty soon you will be next

75
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,949
51 minutes until the carpeting of the hotel to go to the airport

76
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:59,699
I think that this has to be my turn around .

77
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:15,140
well it was a good run i'm glad i got it in now i have exactly 12 minutes before

78
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:24,590

87
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,730
wouldn't let me check it and they said Security's gonna take it from me so

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,720
and

95
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,360
the matter

96
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:21,160
I would just make me sad australia what I travel around the world I think every

97
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,620
single month if the policy is no boosted boards i understand then no boosted

98
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,450
boards if the policy is boosted boards are great i prefer that but you can't

99
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,550
have this will define malleable flexible otherwise just doesn't seem fair like

100
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,800
the the burden of information that shouldn't fall on us like you're

101

104
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,180
grip

105
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,010
