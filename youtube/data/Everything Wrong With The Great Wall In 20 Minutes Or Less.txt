1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,530
the universal logo gets in gets out gets

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,969
on with the toy life obviously aware of

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,650
what turrets distributing domestically

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,120
that's seriously the fastest the

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,010
universal logo has gone by in like 15

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,779
years or so I'd be thankful if their

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,210
shame weren't so obvious Comcast reading

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,890
movie should have given my seventh-grade

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,630
paper entitled the Great Wall of China

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,910
the mystery the majesty and the legend a

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,680
partial writing credit maybe it will

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,570
also get a c-minus for my social studies

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,820
teacher we were the strongest remember

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,940
why you're here what is that accent Matt

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,940
Damon's doing as unless for dead twice

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,440
movie continues the story of the

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,000
revenant man thinks we can't tell the

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,229
difference between Matt Damon and

19
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,330
Leonardo DiCaprio and while I admit it's

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,710
super tough to distinguish the two of

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,150
them I'm one of the people on earth who

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,460
can a bunch of whatever and in the first

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,540
six minutes this movie is already

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,949
deciding it's not going to show us

25
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,690
anything and edit it sloppily this is

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,040
how fifth graders shoot movies when they

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,330
don't have access to makeup and special

28
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,890
effects what's your Excuse

29
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,979
I don't know and nobody making the movie

30
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,449
that was either so these two guys

31
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,920
survived is something and just keep

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,270
riding like they didn't start out with a

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,830
dozen men and I'm mostly pissed at this

34
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,909
point how little this movie's

35
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,110
character's seem to care about killed

36
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,009
friends hello wait long wait

37
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,750
this is a cool visual I'll grant you but

38
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,520
why the would you waste as many arrows

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,890
on a show of strength move holy that's

40
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,909
Prince Oberyn from Game of Thrones

41
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,740
slumming his ass off here in this

42
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,240
Chinese attempt at a Hollywood

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,799
blockbuster everyone in this movie is

44
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,520
better than this

45
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,259
decent visual with why are there so many

46
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,060
goddamn soldiers stacked and lined up in

47
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,679
this castles always like build the

48
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,030
hallways bigger if they're going to be

49
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,859
commonly filled with as many bodies say

50
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,420
well commander is conveniently hot so

51
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,130
they'll keep watching this where was it

52
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,570
found you speak English

53
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,850
super common for ancient Chinese female

54
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,499
warrior leaders to speak English

55
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:46,049
duh Matt Damon ossification jutsu Yap

56
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,020
neutral absolute um okay I told pokey

57
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,579
this movie is already knocking off Game

58
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,960
of Thrones the creatures they're about

59
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,399
to face from the north are essentially

60
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,079
the White Walkers and a guy who played

61
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,460
Oberyn Martell is right next to Matt

62
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,289
Damon and Matt Damon acted in the same

63
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,149
movie as Sean Bean one time and winter

64
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,890
is coming

65
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,420
strategist Wang is the best accidental

66
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,509
band name ever why are you here we came

67
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,360
to trade a sudden Willem Dafoe also does

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
the movie seriously need this many white

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,270
people this is an ex knockin attack

70
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,860
right here they're just about to decide

71
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,970
whether to kill these two English

72
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,319
speakers and suddenly they get attacked

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,060
throw dudes in the stockade so they can

74
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,349
later learn English speakers know how to

75
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,790
fight monsters let them out to help in

76
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,110
the battle the N

77
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,670
crash this film was written by a 12 year

78
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,080
old I don't want to call over ancient

79
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,880
China but how many war drummers do they

80
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,560
really need and who said war drummers

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,110
need to be elaborately dressed blah

82
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,700
this idiot key master is the reason why

83
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,840
Matt Damon will be fighting monsters

84
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,460
instead of sitting in a prison cell

85
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,050
destiny is when you have tens of

86
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,580
thousands of trained Chinese fighters in

87
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,600
a battle they've been preparing for

88
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,280
their whole lives against monsters but a

89
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
simple mistake allows one white guy to

90
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,700
turn a tie you to prisoners we very

91
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,440
nearly executed she'll stand here on the

92
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,820
command deck while a battle happens

93
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,320
because we subconsciously already

94
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,420
realize we super need your help wait are

95
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,770
all the girls soldiers dressed in this

96
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,510
bright blue armor are we segregating in

97
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,240
this army by color luck are the foot

98
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,150
soldiers all right those are the archers

99
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,590
easily distinguishable by not only their

100
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,360
red clothing but all the archery stuff

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,940
blue they're all women what the hell do

102
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,620
they do well if I go back in history

103
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,090
they're the ones with the lightning kick

104
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,650
and the spinning bird kick and sometimes

105
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,120
they taught you by saying want to see my

106
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,140
kung-fu I'll show you

107
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,150
so rest easy also they throw spears

108
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,250
apparently which is for some reason a

109
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,930
sexually segregated war skill in the

110
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,239
society we just saw this same already I

111
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,620
get this movie wants to have its calm

112
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,330
before the storm pre-battle moment but

113
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,459
but set off all the urgent battle alarms

114
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,870
if you all got ready but still had to

115
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,459
wait for the enemy for a while

116
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,440
discount fiery marble madness according

117
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,510
to this movie the Great Wall is 5,500

118
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,950
miles long but this movie is still

119
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,600
focusing on just this one section of the

120
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,450
wall am I to believe the other 5,400 49

121
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,950
miles of this wall or under similar

122
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,600
attack this entire movie or that they

123
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
just didn't consolidate forces well

124
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,269
enough on this one section to end this

125
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,070
attack quickly movie focuses on one

126
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,570
single flow motion projectile that will

127
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,140
hit its target true cliche oh sure thing

128
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,850
boss those are easy to see and target

129
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,500
from here also the monsters have video

130
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,650
game weak spots

131
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,689
I knew this movie had mystical elements

132
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,069
and monsters but I didn't realize they

133
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,780
would be hilariously stupid Crocky fauna

134
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,939
sources with faux hawks also yes if

135
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,170
you're not catching my drift I'm totally

136
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,760
mocking the creature design here as it

137
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,769
appears to be laziest moving once so bad

138
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,299
to be helms deep it forgot that it had

139
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,739
half the talent and one-tenth the budget

140
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,329
but still went through with things while

141
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:15,950
watching these Blue badasses of hotness

142
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,419
bungee jump off the wall and killing

143
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,130
some of the monsters is kind of cool it

144
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,229
seems super inefficient but killing what

145
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,000
a handful of these bastards at a time um

146
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,160
humans cannot operate regular ropes fast

147
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,750
enough for them to serve as bungee scott

148
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,190
damn this movie is offensive even

149
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,630
without Matt Damon's involvement no

150
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,160
seriously I really launched 20 minutes

151
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,750
of this dirt and I'm soaking mad about

152
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,100
the regular ropes being pulled fast

153
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
enough to serve as bungee cords thing

154
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm ready to add 1000 sins and give the

155
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,500
cup on this movie I can't do that

156
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,970
because it's not ethical to our formula

157
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,830
and format but hot Jesus I really want

158
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,510
to more than ever before this is a

159
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,010
flaming bag of poo on the front porch of

160
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,389
your life stamp it out and you only get

161
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,560
flaming poo all over your shoes and

162
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,870
pants oh they got one took them long

163
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,580
enough and suck at being a threat this

164
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,960
is the first one of these dangling human

165
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,370
being fishing lures they've managed to

166
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,990
catch let's talk about the great wall

167
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,940
plan for a moment we're going to super

168
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,199
overstaffed the drumming department

169
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,970
because we love sound then we're going

170
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,440
to stat the top of the wall with tons of

171
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,880
archers and these flaming meteor

172
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,949
propellers and all the projectile

173
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,660
weapons you can think of then we're

174
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,979
going to create these platforms and get

175
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,750
these ladies some killer Spears and use

176
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,280
rope and human strength to create a

177
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,080
bungee effect where they dive down into

178
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,430
close quarters with the enemy and stab

179
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,810
them manually do I have that right

180
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,820
there's only one group going down to

181
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,320
attack in person and it's the old lady's

182
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,389
battalion this movie offers me so many

183
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,590
paths for sitting I can barely choose

184
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,960
that's sad because all these rings

185
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,370
represent how stupid those attacks are

186
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,760
yep okay my Cintiq item guy not playing

187
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,050
Prince Oberyn would be excellent at

188
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,750
cinemasins here's an escape yes that one

189
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,070
human can definitely help you escape

190
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,840
this million-person battle of course he

191
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,120
can can I swoop over subpar CGI that

192
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
does nothing for nobody here's the

193
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,699
sentence I'd never thought I'd say but

194
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,590
here we go this movie totally rips off

195
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,539
World War Z God and these drummers get

196
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:48,949
as much screen time as Matt Damon does

197
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,510
the thing that was one guy randomly

198
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,740
walking around the wall who could cut

199
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,270
william loose i'm going to venture that

200
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,680
this is Willem Dafoe's only reason for

201
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,210
being in this movie after seeing this

202
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,770
movie yeah I totally stand by that

203
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,229
statement I don't run run where so

204
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,789
you're just begging to be freed so you

205
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,260
can die in this battle how about you run

206
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,270
on anywhere the opposite side of the

207
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,310
wall I draw the eye

208
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,080
how does william know that command to go

209
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,849
for the eyes was yelled in Mandarin

210
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,020
hasn't been able to see any part of the

211
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,639
battle and the only experience he had

212
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,779
fighting these things with when he cut

213
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,429
off an arm so the cause he an expert at

214
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:17,959
monster fighting all of a sudden that

215
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,999
Damon action star through editing ladies

216
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,619
and gentlemen also if he was so good at

217
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:22,909
catching a spear in midair and attacking

218
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,529
a monster he really should have aim for

219
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,059
the eye since he's such an expert at

220
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:29,479
killing these things and all the

221
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,830
scraping sound you hear is actually the

222
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,149
sound of Matt Damon's bank account

223
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,439
trying to keep up with the massive

224
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,819
influx of money from appearing in this

225
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,289
film turns out it made a good sound

226
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:37,459
effect for this scene as well and

227
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,199
everyone was pleased he's purple close

228
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,849
combat assholes here in the background

229
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,679
are useless literally not one of the

230
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,809
moves movie will now make fake mythical

231
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,550
ala gremlins somehow subject to the same

232
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,289
Cape waiving bias as standard earth

233
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:53,089
bolts for some reason this is monster

234
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,379
talk for this movie needs to be

235
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,939
feature-length so let's go back log a

236
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,379
few more hours in the simulator and

237
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,539
attack again later because hang us now I

238
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,759
could use the rest who's trying left

239
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,860
here the screenwriters are Damon not be

240
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,419
looking at hopes about some cliche

241
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,300
Mirabal saw me making in the end of the

242
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,860
duration you can push really enchanted

243
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,740
ear how so these assholes didn't do

244
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,580
anything special

245
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,139
the only real advantage they had was

246
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,639
having large numbers they're not Raptors

247
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,079
they weren't systematically looking for

248
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,930
weaknesses in the perimeter fence hi I'm

249
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,519
Willem Dafoe and I introduced myself by

250
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,869
sticking a torch near your face while

251
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:25,069
you're sleeping instead of simply saying

252
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,990
hi I'm Willem Dafoe you may recognize me

253
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,059
from such films as nymphomaniac volume 2

254
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,129
spider-man to speed to cruise control

255
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,559
and platoon I came with mercenaries for

256
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,759
the same thing 25 years ago hmm okay but

257
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,019
the people of the great wall we're about

258
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,189
to imprison William and Tovar

259
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,929
indefinitely until their heroics so what

260
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,279
exactly did this guy do to be able to

261
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,289
walk around so freely on gentleman power

262
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,329
guy that the powers that be at the great

263
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,009
wall interrupt dinner so that William

264
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,689
can show his inner katniss everdeen

265
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,240
talk about some Hunger Games am i right

266
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
right okay first of all some King bolt

267
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,339
Legolas saw this and said cough mate

268
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,379
second of all he shot all those arrows

269
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,119
within 1.5 seconds of each other but

270
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,499
then the last you took way longer to

271
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,149
arrive on scene than the first one that

272
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,009
tipped the bowl third of all I hate this

273
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,809
movie I hate too soon writing assignment

274
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:09,740
and I hate Matt Damon

275
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,179
Oberyn Martel is either doing exactly

276
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,800
what I'm doing right now or he's mocking

277
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,069
me

278
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,779
wait he was just standing up right next

279
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,339
to Damon but in the three seconds since

280
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,199
he walked over to a bench sat down and

281
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,879
then got bored on a feelin you know what

282
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,459
I think I think you afraid movie stops

283
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,229
dead in its tracks oh that William and

284
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:24,740
Lynn can

285
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,919
Bunji flirt a taste a glitz a few blue

286
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,949
food grains from strategists long supply

287
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,630
of black powder every time they say a

288
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,219
strategist Wang I picture a hand of the

289
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,020
king on Game of Thrones tossing his dick

290
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,940
on a giant table size warm out and Yan

291
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,289
adores you have keys I have black powder

292
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,149
enough for central doors why didn't

293
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,649
Ballard escape during the first monster

294
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,510
attack was he so curious about William

295
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,920
and Tovar he couldn't carry out the plan

296
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,750
I know the monsters attacked early but

297
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,950
seems like this dude's been thinking

298
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,959
about this for a long time like 25 years

299
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,339
so why didn't he take the opportunity

300
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,190
that there was an emperor who's brought

301
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,110
deep suffering to all of China

302
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,520
luckily to prove this guy's point

303
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,529
historical Scrolls adorn this entire war

304
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,060
room so that you can give William visual

305
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,370
aids the Hasson sent to meet you

306
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,470
that struck Coalmont him they could also

307
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,029
just start calling this guy exposition

308
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,670
Aswang sums that day on the Tao tear

309
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,190
rise every 60 years they're like really

310
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,709
patient locusts they come to remind us

311
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,740
of what happens when greed is unchecked

312
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,080
also she depends on her soldiers to

313
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,850
feature later Wang tells them that

314
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,260
everyone who goes to hunt these things

315
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,010
never returns

316
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,810
so how has anyone been able to observe

317
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,100
these monsters to know this much about

318
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,940
them I'm the dude come on it's common

319
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,410
knowledge that soldiers on horseback at

320
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,029
least in the melee weapon age are better

321
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,010
at fighting than soldiers on foot so why

322
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,600
after noting something was off does this

323
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,860
general dude command everyone to

324
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,720
dismount and yes they do this shield

325
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,000
formation thing look at not one of these

326
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,170
people behind the shields can see jack

327
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,149
or including the general this is the

328
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:54,589
stupidest fucking investigate something

329
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:55,790
weird formation in the history of

330
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,490
earthly militaries

331
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,910
[Applause]

332
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,620
this might have worked if they didn't

333
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,000
scream to announce their presence and

334
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,920
after the general was bitten stuff

335
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,360
happened maybe the creatures got away

336
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,710
maybe they were killed by the remaining

337
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,820
soldiers we'll never know

338
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,470
that's kind of sad this movie cares more

339
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,820
about trying to make me sad that this

340
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,620
asshat is dying than it does the action

341
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,820
it promised from the outset goddammit so

342
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,170
the first attack they filled almost no

343
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,820
intelligence and then on the second

344
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,050
surprise attack they get points for

345
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,430
being somewhat intelligent but they

346
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,110
screw it up these monsters need to show

347
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,550
a hell of a lot more intelligence before

348
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,960
anyone admits to under estimating it

349
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,190
this death scene would be way more

350
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,660
powerful this guy had been given any

351
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,000
real character also holy SH this movie

352
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,460
made 170 million in China like China 8

353
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,500
to stop I wonder do only the soldiers

354
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,330
nearby get to mourn the general or did

355
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,620
everyone abandon the entire five

356
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,820
thousand mile wall to come to this

357
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,440
funeral yes I'm still harping on this

358
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,610
because the movie's biggest problem

359
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,870
which is saying something is how it

360
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,950
wants to make all the action take place

361
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,630
on one small section of a wall that is

362
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,580
undeniably far too long for this movie

363
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,230
that make sense seriously this movie

364
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,000
wastes a ton of time this is all for a

365
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,410
character we saw in a couple scenes and

366
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,150
never got to know movies given us one

367
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,650
battle we already saw it done better in

368
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,270
the two towers in World War Z and the

369
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,800
rest has been bungee jumping in funerals

370
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,540
what it's a town tayyar so intelligent

371
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,070
why don't they attack now well everyone

372
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,990
is in super not battle-ready morning

373
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,700
gear and posture by the way this is a

374
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,440
colossal cheat in movies when you do

375
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,910
these floating death lanterns it looks

376
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,780
absolutely gorgeous

377
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,950
how can you hate something that looks so

378
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,480
pretty they're here to say forget your

379
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,770
issues with this movie these lanterns

380
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,550
will call me

381
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,580
I believe that magnet was the reason it

382
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,220
was two of you Westerners killed the

383
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,590
town che so easily movie really doesn't

384
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,030
show what's so special about the town

385
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,470
today that they couldn't be killed so

386
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,540
easily they have a video game weak spot

387
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,250
they aren't ninjas there's just a lot of

388
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,710
them that's their only skill even if the

389
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,310
magnet makes the total death without the

390
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,440
instruction they fall still so they're

391
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,760
the aliens from Independence Day then

392
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,950
excellent also these people knew magnets

393
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,450
cause such a thing and have known this

394
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,340
for 900 years well I haven't most of

395
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,900
their time been spent trying to find or

396
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,460
create magnets they have 60 years

397
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,110
between attacks to look for putting

398
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,420
magnets by my math that's 15 generations

399
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,980
of monster attacks that went magnet was

400
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,080
magnets man how do they work also what

401
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,430
happened to the great magnet that helped

402
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,700
kill those beasts 900 years ago man how

403
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
can we

404
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,650
why not try it yeah that's a great idea

405
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,330
we should try something to see if it

406
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,680
works why didn't anyone think of this

407
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,670
trying before toy dia China Audrina if

408
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,930
you've got some sort of potion that

409
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,460
might possibly put these monsters to

410
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,380
sleep why isn't this in mass production

411
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,580
why haven't you been throwing cauldrons

412
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,320
of this at the creatures I mean Jesus

413
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
they're making all these hunt and

414
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,140
capture atonte preparations like

415
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,630
imminent but looking at this fog over

416
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,250
the wall it's literally impossible they

417
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,170
saw one coming but convenient since they

418
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,190
need to catch one of these creatures

419
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,230
using their new magnet of hack the idea

420
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,090
that these listening horns would do any

421
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,650
measurable bit of good you it's no way

422
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,880
the creature with that silent running up

423
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,380
the wall then started screaming like a

424
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,570
useless dick Tang even Matt Damon's more

425
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,980
conscience is phoning it in here

426
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,290
harpoons I love how in the second major

427
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,520
battle they unveil all these weapons

428
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,020
they never even tried using the first

429
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,730
battle like the harpoons and the dudes

430
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,170
on ropes running down the wall to fight

431
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,730
hand to hand and the scissor cutting in

432
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,290
wall blades I wonder what they're going

433
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,330
to save for the third battle okay he's

434
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,890
doing his I decided to do the right

435
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,260
thing hero walk fine what are all these

436
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,610
opposite direction marching assholes

437
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,590
doing where are they going Damon says

438
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,790
they need to isolate the creature from

439
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,560
the others she yells ring a fire and

440
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,030
immediately a bunch of catapults launch

441
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,250
fiery things somehow surround the

442
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,050
targeted tout a even though no one ever

443
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,550
told the Ring of Fire people where to

444
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,040
fame they line that up before the battle

445
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,600
and it ended up being perfect these

446
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,340
assholes shoot arrows into the fog and

447
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,960
somehow completely miss William which is

448
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,130
insanely lucky

449
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,839
[Applause]

450
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,730
he did not have time to do that also two

451
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,050
of our shows up out of mother cooking

452
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,759
know where to save William how did he

453
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,529
know where to go it's called the edge I

454
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,060
don't think he climbed down the chain to

455
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,540
get here so because it's not every day

456
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,370
the movie itself goes so far out of its

457
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,569
way to point out the scene where it

458
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,980
crosses the line with the head like

459
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,019
you're doing

460
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:03,970
so he's right that she's listening cool

461
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,680
story bro but her immediately calling

462
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,060
for black-powder weapons instead of a

463
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,829
rescue squad what message did she think

464
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,029
he was sending when he fired those

465
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:15,490
whistling arrows back up at her and yet

466
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,110
they are blind firing super deadly

467
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,060
explosive firework weapons through a fog

468
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,800
into an area where they know the dudes

469
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,089
they're trying to protect their standing

470
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:23,170
that's actually what's happening right

471
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:23,410
now

472
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,089
and sure you could argue she doesn't

473
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:26,500
care about the two white men below and

474
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,029
maybe she doesn't but she's still

475
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,040
ultimately facing a legion of tau a and

476
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,870
ostensibly trying to capture one of them

477
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,209
here so how is firing bomb arrows down

478
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,740
here supposed to help her side in any

479
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,569
way she might kill the white guys that

480
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:38,829
know more than they do and she might

481
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,819
kill the specimen they're trying to

482
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,579
capture so what is I know very little of

483
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:43,990
the outside world

484
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,819
you know besides mostly perfect English

485
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,250
forget what happening this is my mantra

486
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,590
for most movies I walk

487
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,020
[Music]

488
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,089
come on this thing was supposedly

489
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,980
drugged by a tipped arrow the best you

490
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,480
could do while it was under was put him

491
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,890
in a small cage he could easily roll

492
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,779
over and not bind his arms and legs you

493
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,820
can chain it up or hit it with even more

494
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,529
drugged arrows I'm embarrassed for you

495
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,760
and how an F you aren't doing things

496
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,440
seems like this could maybe have been

497
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,670
done in the field of battle and they

498
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,750
wouldn't have had to go through all the

499
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,890
trouble of capturing one of these

500
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,899
assholes but experiment to prove what

501
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,640
has already proved as experiment much

502
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,890
braver than I think lines protagonists

503
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,270
still two characters and movies to see

504
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,459
more protagonists II also it's the real

505
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,750
reason they underestimate this guy

506
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,640
really bravery or is it because he's

507
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,370
stupid and clumsy sign this petition

508
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,080
this cut me I'm not chasing us that is

509
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,910
sage I'm wondering does it take very

510
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,920
long to kill somebody also does it take

511
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,690
the entire army to kill somebody sleep

512
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,800
late they have enough people to do both

513
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,130
things can't be a multitask it's like

514
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,290
how dare you come on tungsten Tonga

515
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,880
what's the job so there's the third time

516
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,959
these assholes have mentioned how

517
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,279
they've underestimated the intelligence

518
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,839
of these creatures the question is once

519
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,190
they realize they've underestimated the

520
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,750
intelligence just how much intelligence

521
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,399
do they give them credit for how do they

522
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,029
qualify

523
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,410
you can't keep low balling them on

524
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,670
intelligence and be surprised when they

525
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,760
jump the bar see if it's gone out sit

526
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,020
safe of course cities please don't comic

527
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,089
leaks god damn it this is the first time

528
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,740
Ballard's ever been in this room and yet

529
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,209
he knew he could cut a rope and have

530
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,770
something heavy fall on William it just

531
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,300
happens to be in the right spot I don't

532
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,290
even know why they bothered to tie

533
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,670
whatever this is in the manner that they

534
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,560
did but it seems to exist only because

535
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,540
the script says it does they show no

536
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,910
dimension so dosage oh cool well mildew

537
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,250
some done so were they afraid that if

538
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,720
they didn't attack them all somebody

539
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,950
would have wandered down here and found

540
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,510
the tunnel or is the process of tunnel

541
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,070
digging so loud they needed to cover war

542
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,240
to dig it here nan Yamaguchi de su ho

543
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
Goku conscious yeah except magnets or

544
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,070
Monte sheets you sing funny there's no

545
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,570
better successful test though than when

546
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,980
you really need them to work for the

547
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,959
plot hey let's take this thing we barely

548
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,640
even captured and that slipped this

549
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,140
metal cage all over the place on top of

550
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,670
the wall all the way into our kingdom to

551
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,620
meet our teen ruler raise your hand if

552
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,060
you love that idea as much as I do I

553
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,149
just stopped there to speak to me so do

554
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,200
they really think that William tried to

555
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,550
steal black powder and I'm like a doofus

556
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,320
got beat over the head by a hanging bag

557
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,449
of doodads in the process manufactured

558
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,540
conflict is manufactured

559
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,150
Wow shocker Willem Dafoe's character was

560
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,980
in it for himself all along still know

561
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,420
what he needed with William or Tovar but

562
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,059
man what a dick I am appalled well there

563
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,230
are a bunch of these Hindenburg

564
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,819
contraptions taking flight at once and

565
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,230
yet somehow this movie is going to end

566
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,000
with the humans victorious is there a

567
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,170
chat yes only one to the Queen starship

568
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,699
troopers in the house yell hello world

569
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,829
what you have seen and tell them what

570
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,449
this coming they will definitely believe

571
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,770
your story and immediately start mass

572
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,910
production of magnets Damon ex machina

573
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,130
also is he riding an eagle here do I

574
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,980
just still have lotr PTSD to deal with I

575
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,590
thank you Frank and Here I am let's do

576
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,950
it

577
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,110
they will not attempt on the Queen in 3d

578
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,570
we have a tag that is entirely new

579
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,400
information though in Australia these

580
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,230
tight a minions circle the Queen in the

581
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,910
opposite direction this guy is still

582
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,710
around drowning on a horse super slowly

583
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,540
and carrying this dynamite thing and it

584
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,950
says a lot about this movie that I have

585
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,540
no recollection of how he got here even

586
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,710
though that was like ten minutes ago the

587
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,400
boring Captain America yeah suicide a

588
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,990
rogue I say it's the day but probably

589
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,580
also kills all of its friends if you

590
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,990
care about physics but this movie

591
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,580
clearly does not care about physics Oh

592
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,190
hmm I guess add a thin because I'm so

593
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,720
exhausted and nothing is more to blame

594
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,809
in this movie we'll go to the Queen next

595
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,850
time it should it will

596
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,200
here's where I start railing against

597
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
these King movies where the threat is

598
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,500
hide mind it it's so boring

599
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,330
kill the queen or the mothership or the

600
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,700
head vampire it's too easy make a threat

601
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,500
with some diversity tickets this chart

602
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,730
is going to let the underling into the

603
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,960
hive even though he's got a bunch of

604
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,730
bomb strapped to his back and while they

605
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,020
may not know what bombs are I've been

606
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,700
told I've vastly underestimated their

607
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,440
intelligence at every turn so this

608
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,820
magnet can be drawn from all the way

609
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,500
down here and still attract to the

610
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,850
little bit of metal all the way up here

611
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,800
then surely it has more power than the 9

612
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,630
feet we were told earlier for the second

613
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,620
time in her own movie we'll tie the

614
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,750
runtime with a you think he got it but

615
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,980
the enemy will foil it at the last

616
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,530
second scene I'm swaying for this my

617
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,130
whole life

618
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,140
dumb ass stupid idiotic King bungee

619
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,550
attack is going to win the day

620
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,410
not since Shia and crystal skull as a

621
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,520
movie character swinging on a vine

622
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,530
offended me so personally William and

623
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,420
Lin survived this I could take the black

624
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,940
powder or I could take you if I were in

625
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,200
William shoes I would have proposed a

626
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,950
third option

627
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,820
general Lin's baby what is

coming in to save Asian cultures first

630
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,559
The Last Samurai then love another drug

631
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:27,659
czar now this I would build a great wall

632
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,340
and nobody builds walls better than me

633
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,210
believe me this one some V Lynaugh went

634
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:45,269
to his car legend tells of a legendary

635

warrior whose kung fu skills were the

636
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:53,269
