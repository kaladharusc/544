3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,250
it's worth asking how long will Fox keep

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,650
using the 20th century logo in the 21st

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,970
century will they be watching a screener

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,010
in 2345 and some intern will finally

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,570
pipe up you know we really should update

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,100
that and the studio heads will not

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,720
quietly in collective realization

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,220
nice try DreamWorks but you're not going

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,660
to distract me from loading this 47

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,460
seconds of two logos why should pot of

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,260
time yet another DreamWorks movie opens

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,730
with a shot of a storybook and Once Upon

15
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,529
a Time rip the only thing left to do to

16
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,300
ensure brand loyalty is to now show a

17
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,949
montage of a character doing disgusting

18
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:36,050
Shrek style poo things wow these tools

19
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,610
sure do look a lot like stitch from

20
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,170
Disney's lilo and stay hey where'd all

21
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,969
these lawyers come from bergens didn't

22
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,450
know how to sing or dance or even hug

23
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,059
sure these Bergen assholes are assholes

24
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,710
but resorting to wedgies as a form of

25
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,020
communication meaning at all made them

26
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,540
feel so happy they started a tradition

27
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm not surprised

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,320
trolls are apparently 40% hair and 60%

29
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,010
pure MDMA once a year every year the

30
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,050
Bergen would gather around the troll

31
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,659
tree to taste happiness well I once a

32
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,520
year if eating a troll mix the Bergin's

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,990
feels so good wouldn't they be gobbling

34
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,340
them up by the bushel you know there's a

35
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,539
Bergen named Larry that's totally

36
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,920
addicted to that and it's sneaking them

37
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,329
off at a ziploc bag or something and

38
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,440
binging at home

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,240
[Music]

40
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,799
in the hall of the Mountain King gets a

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,719
hip-hop update and Edvard Grieg is

42
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,250
popping and locking in his grave

43
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,229
seriously the Virgin's eat trolls but

44
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:27,820
they also have a doughnut shop doesn't

45
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,380
that make them happy too how can you

46
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,610
sadly eat a doughnut

47
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,990
they're lighter fluid looks more like

48
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,399
Nickelodeon slime than lighter fluid

49
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,439
wait maybe that is Nickelodeon slime we

50
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,850
just didn't know how flammable it was

51
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,530
that really changes the tone of double

52
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,250
dare this is a very special Roasters how

53
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,390
do they feed the whole town with two

54
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,100
tiny grills and the tiny trolls doesn't

55
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,179
the happiness dissipate when they've

56
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:48,039
divided up into parts also sure we're

57
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,149
about to see some of the trolls escaped

58
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:50,530
here but the bergens have been doing

59
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,039
this for years

60
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,539
we should probably pour one up for all

61
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,829
those poor bastards who weren't around

62
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,270
for Anna Kendrick to team up with Justin

63
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,590
Timberlake and save the world with music

64
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,959
as there is one amongst us who has never

65
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,189
tasted a troll talking about me wait

66
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,659
Prince gristle was less than a year old

67
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,729
and he can ride trikes walk and talk

68
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,289
with that kind of growth rate the older

69
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,700
Bergin should be in wheelchairs by the

70
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,370
time they're 25 it is my sacred duty to

71
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,920
initiate you in the ways of true

72
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,260
happiness Bergen or not this should be

73
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,640
filed under the creepy things that

74
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,799
should never be said to a child make me

75
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,930
happy Bobby what the hell are the girls

76
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,120
for then I think I hear something

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,950
the trolls are making their escape right

78
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,060
at the time of the troll stuff so you

79
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,350
think they'd be a little quieter about

80
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,790
it sighs and it's in and we already have

81
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,079
our second underwear sight gag

82
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,150
dreamworks you do you also if they're

83
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,260
digging they would have picked up the

84
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,239
axe and slung again but chef apparently

85
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,410
thought this was good enough and called

86
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,150
it a day it was this easy to escape the

87
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,470
troll tree why didn't they do it long

88
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,079
before now she's young i banished from

89
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,200
bergen town forever i know king grizzle

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,099
was looking for a scapegoat

91
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,989
why is chef the one that's banished I

92
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,090
mean she just cooks the trolls right she

93
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,380
can't be the only one in town checking

94
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,730
in with him on the regular she will

95
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,720
never ever ever ever be happy meddler

96
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
ever but there's a portrait right behind

97
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,470
them of the king and Prince cheesing

98
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,849
since the Prince hadn't had parole

99
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,139
before either this painting was done

100
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,849
today which is some both or they were

101
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,239
previously happy this is where we will

102
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,489
rebuild our civilization unless we've

103
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,810
just had a massive time jump they

104
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,069
couldn't be more than a day's walk from

105
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,930
Bergen town given their tiny legs and

106
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,160
the fact that many of them were slow

107
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,019
during the escape I would think this new

108
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,730
spot is about a half a mile from certain

109
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,050
Bergen death it has everything

110
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,440
we need fresh air clean water and sweet

111
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,930
acoustic I half expected to hear Smash

112
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,890
Mouth all-stars

113
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,230
also a trolls movie in 2016 wait a

114
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,060
straight while the iron is hot also also

115
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,280
7 minutes and 32 seconds into the movies

116
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
when we get the title of the movie it's

117
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,250
like 8 percent of the movie already and

118
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,230
now every troll is free to be happy and

119
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,640
live in perfect harmony

120
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,080
my princesses always get stuck watching

121
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,700
the village kids they didn't have anyone

122
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,930
else who could read from the sacred book

123
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,250
of exposition what the hell are these

124
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,900
little things and not trolls and they

125
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,190
weren't in the rescue party from 20

126
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,580
years ago

127
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,500
so the troll race must have been slave

128
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,480
trained and domesticated an entirely new

129
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,190
species for transportation and acoustic

130
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,210
drumming which is pretty goddamn

131
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,160
gruesome okay I can buy that the trolls

132
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,480
have functional photography in this

133
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,920
universe but why does biggie have a

134
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,870
suggested boudoir picture of his minion

135
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,040
in a bikini something's missing we were

136
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,420
almost at the 10-minute mark when I was

137
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,200
where we weren't going to get any

138
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,880
scatological humor in this cocoon thing

139
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,250
I could hear you from a mile away if I

140
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,190
can hear you so can the Bergen but they

141
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,780
haven't the trolls have presumably been

142
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,190
doing routines like this for 20 years

143
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,320
with not one of those preparing them the

144
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,050
targets are going ah hang on I thought

145
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,790
trolls were always happy shouldn't their

146
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,530
funeral be more like New Orleans wakes

147
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,270
also a dump branch showing any

148
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,800
advancement in age this clown troll

149
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,150
worked at a party fell in love got

150
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,310
married and then died also also thanks

151
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,870
to a mortician for searing this

152
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,280
nightmarish image of a clown cruel

153
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
corpse into my head I don't do happy but

154
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
why not as he's had a traumatic event is

155
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,820
past but he's a troll controls seem to

156
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,200
be genetically predisposed to happiness

157
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,850
but branches all rebellious lee sad

158
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,920
that's like a cow consciously deciding

159
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,380
not to produce milk some folks just

160
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,540
don't want to be happy right but they

161
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,130
are folks they are a species of

162
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,020
perpetually happy trolls so it seems

163
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,550
that they shouldn't be as dismissive of

164
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,440
his behavior they should treat him more

165
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,120
like he's a psychopath interest but

166
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,650
these poor trolls are stuck up in the

167
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,030
air for the entirety of the party

168
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,440
spinning and spinning instead of

169
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,760
enjoying it with their friends below

170
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,520
yeah yeah it's almost like this script

171
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,080
was written by 47 year old dudes that

172
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,070
we're forced to come up with how they

173
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,560
think young Millennials talk looking hey

174
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,390
it was just Lydia is basically the ant

175
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,680
and the grasshopper fable but with

176
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,240
glitter feces and clown corpses

177
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,620
well they always capable of this glitter

178
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,820
supernova and

179
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,230
wouldn't they have tried a test of this

180
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,510
before also poppy is overexcited but

181
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,400
she's not an idiot right the music and

182
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,750
noise is one thing but why would she

183
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,370
authorized this obvious glitter flare

184
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,170
within range of everyone nearby defeat

185
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,330
also the king is right there at the

186
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,920
party shouldn't he at least put a stop

187
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,060
to this but dude's been through the

188
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,830
scourge and escape from the Bergen since

189
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,660
the beginning so the chef has been robed

190
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,340
for the last twenty fifteen years but

191
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,900
hasn't had a width of parole until now

192
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,340
and she's right next to them

193
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,570
she's pretty but I think this troll

194
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,100
village is a little more Pandora than

195
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,570
the filmmakers intended gotcha really

196
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,610
moving can there not be one animated non

197
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,080
Pixar movie that doesn't have that

198
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,580
character poops when scared cliche I

199
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,630
would say you're better than that

200
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,250
but after previously watching this I

201
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,050
know that not to be true so carry on I

202
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,820
guess sakis hair somehow has the

203
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,440
strength to tug firmly against chefs

204
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
grasp even though chefs been picking up

205
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,710
the other trolls by the hair until now

206
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,540
chef has access to many other trolls

207
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,920
that she just spent a little more time

208
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,570
looking for them like you know she's

209
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,760
been doing for the past 20 years branch

210
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,560
decimated this invitation when poppy

211
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,850
gave it to him but it's magically

212
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,140
without a scratch here because we need a

213
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,000
reason to like this character also grump

214
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,470
secretly wants to join the fun cliche

215
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,120
when we go to Bergen town with me and

216
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,040
save everyone there are still like 30

217
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,420
trolls left in the village but poppy

218
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,070
goes to the one dude that doesn't get

219
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,540
along with anyone to ask for help you

220
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,280
told me not just with a party and I

221
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,870
threw it anyway it's not throwing the

222
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,310
party that was the problem it was

223
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,540
shooting fireworks in the air that

224
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,770
basically said delicious trolls here

225
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,380
it's my fault they were taken and now I

226
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,940
don't know what to do why don't you try

227
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,860
scrapbooking them the freedom Jesus this

228
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,570
movie cast maybe the two most likable

229
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,040
leads in the world but gave them such

230
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,510
huge character flaws that's impossible

231
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,310
to refer either of them hey any time

232
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,140
poppy see in ten years

233
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,700
branch clearly doesn't expect poppy or

234
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,750
any of the troll to live that long poppy

235
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,100
wasn't gone long enough to let everyone

236
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,080
in which means they got through all the

237
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,760
branches locks and traps meaning his

238
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,250
bunker building skills are horse

239
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,900
[Music]

240
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,980
non-consensual hugging this journey to

241
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,120
Bergen town is suddenly fraught with

242
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,570
peril

243
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,130
look just 20 years ago the king lit a

244
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,570
bunch of slow-ass trolls out here in

245
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,920
less than a day were there many more

246
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,330
trolls that didn't make it during the

247
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,920
trip that we don't know about also if

248
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,450
this is how dangerous the jungle is then

249
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,280
they may be safer with the Bergin's they

250
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,139
just try and eat them once a year

251
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,759
probably surprised us also I know most

252
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,350
kids at this age won't be asking those

253
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,970
questions yet but this is not the best

254
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,810
way to be teaching them about

255
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,580
reproduction poppies walk to Bergen town

256
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,289
takes her through an acid rain storm a

257
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,940
desert and a pink blizzard within the

258
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,440
span of one day branch at coconut

259
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,509
poppy hang on branch must've been

260
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,500
following poppy throughout this journey

261
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,569
right and if so he's casually watched

262
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,039
her get threatened with fire eaten

263
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,870
cooked into an egg and poison but

264
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,280
chooses now to get concerned about her

265
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
well-being you're a live branch you know

266
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,599
it you don't know anything poppy and I

267
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,949
can't wait to see the look on your face

268
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,449
when you realize the world isn't all

269
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,220
cupcakes and rainbows

270
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,539
why did Branch come on this excursion

271
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,009
then I know he wanted to get away from

272
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,720
the hugging and singing a troll town but

273
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,460
he could have gone anywhere else you

274
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,669
don't stain your fan okay all the time

275
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,650
that's graces I also like a little

276
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:38,800
silence poppy decides to behave like a

277
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,080
literal troll too poor branch also how

278
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,610
would poppy a troll that only knows

279
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,080
happiness know such a dark and

280
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,880
foreboding song and where the hell if

281
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,290
she could pack a car this whole time hey

282
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,810
that's a boot and fast food litter and a

283
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,670
car tire there he was here or there

284
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,899
we're humans which is the more

285
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,760
disturbing option so one of these

286
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,339
tunnels lead to the troll tree I wonder

287
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,290
which one this is information her dad

288
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,520
could have given poppy as she was

289
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,260
leaving instead of organizing a hug orgy

290
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,149
one of these tunnels leads to the troll

291
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,940
tree and the others to certain death

292
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,589
yeah if it doesn't the troll tree also

293
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,450
ensure certain death I mean that's where

294
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,529
the trolls have been picked for Bergen

295
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,240
food for many years really cleared up

296
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,100
exactly what I will not be doing rich

297
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,899
it's a high five

298
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,820
the others lead to certain death yeah

299
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,589
perspective for all her faults during

300
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:21,910
this movie it's apparent poppy would be

301
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,950
excellent at cinemasins shark-attack nom

302
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,260
nom nom jellyfish and family Turkey

303
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,000
Snowman Dolphin helicopter hat supper

304
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,740
lucky to do what gearshift

305
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,899
way too much of this sounds it can we

306
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,550
hug movie continues to derive humor out

307
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,140
of various characters soiling themselves

308
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,550
in terror you're telling me there's only

309
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,290
one forward restaurant in town but there

310
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,670
are three non earth

311
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,110
as appalled as I am to see a gorilla

312
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,120
song used in a subpar movie I'm also

313
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
wondering why the bergens would be

314
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,580
sending this lyric I thought it was a

315
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,900
matter of civic pride that they aren't

316
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,410
happy

317
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,100
yes miserable yeah which means they have

318
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,530
any trauma so what you're saying is if

319
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,090
you with them each rules then they will

320
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,560
all be happy I would assume that will

321
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,910
only make a few of them happy and the

322
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,940
rest of them extremely resentful sad

323
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,890
Todd first on how to Jeff get back into

324
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,360
the city if she were banished there's a

325
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,920
gate at the front of the city a huge ass

326
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,660
door on the castle at least two guards

327
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,070
here second what the hell took her so

328
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,570
long branch and poppy had been on this

329
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,070
journey for what seems like forever but

330
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,720
a chef had a head start and a thousand

331
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,220
percent more stride length she should

332
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,120
have been here ages ago

333
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,380
all these trolls have beautiful natural

334
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,030
voices but there's always one asshole

335
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,670
that has that Kanye I am their king

336
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,050
what happened to the John Cleese version

337
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,880
of the King it's been 20 years sure but

338
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,590
young grifoll is under 21 at this point

339
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,240
he couldn't have been Natalie and who

340
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,010
knows how long the Bergen blip I want

341
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,330
answers to these unimportant questions

342
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,610
can what's your name Oh Ricky movie

343
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,840
wastes almost 40 minutes getting to

344
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,730
arguably the second most talented singer

345
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,570
in the SCAF we must all remain calm

346
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,710
especially since at least 3/4 of you

347
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,060
could simply fit between the bars of the

348
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,530
cage and just walk the hell out of here

349
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,960
sorry baby he who controls the trolls

350
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,740
controls the kingdom and I I am bhakti

351
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,650
your adieu unusually transphobic humor

352
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,540
for a modern children's movie in 2016

353
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,370
this super hair ability seems to come

354
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,810
and go good and poppy have used it

355
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,430
before the spider web scatter couldn't

356
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,870
the captured trolls use it to open the

357
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,310
cage while Shep isn't looking I would

358
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,570
like this movie so much more quick with

359
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,370
30% more hair centric oh you think

360
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:15,970
that's funny

361
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,040
well she's laughing when I bite your

362
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,780
yummy head off which I will not do right

363
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,280
now even though I'm miserable when

364
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,330
you're standing right in front of me ah

365
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,400
oh my dad said the first time should be

366
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,970
special

367
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,410
the second fake out is long enough to

368
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,150
remind me that even though it's only 81

369
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,890
minutes long this movie had to pad its

370
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,560
runtime watching frozen your Roman guard

371
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,310
them with your life

372
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,320
chef gives an incredibly important job

373
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,970
to a young Bergen she just met rather

374
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,110
than taking the trolls with her in a

375
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,510
fanny pack

376
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,339
and bridget is dead there's a Bergen

377
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,260
Beat Magazine who publishes it who

378
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,610
writes the articles there's a cover

379
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,709
story titled and misery but how the hell

380
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:47,699
do they know how to do that

381
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,050
and why does Bridget have to hide it

382
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,010
anyway this is silly but to be fair it's

383
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,540
only the second silliest video ever made

384
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,850
for this alt poppy how could you

385
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,920
possibly think Craig still alive well

386
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,329
we've still got about 40 minutes left in

387
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:01,709
this movie then we've heard creaks dead

388
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,540
about 25 times so I'd say it's a real

389
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,910
good book I suppose I told you I don't

390
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,620
think amazingly talented character

391
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,060
refuses to do the thing he's amazingly

392
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,310
talented at cliche yeah why won't you

393
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:21,110
think of singing killed my grandma okay

394
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,699
why did his erstwhile you for trolls

395
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:32,750
continue to sing depressing a song

396
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,769
apparently all the fantasy characters in

397
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,000
this fantasy movie grew up listening to

398
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,010
the same 1980s human power ballads I

399
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,430
just assumed you had a terrible voice no

400
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,279
no it was like an angel at least that's

401
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,959
what grandma used to say that's also

402
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,170
what Lou Pearlman said at this point you

403
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,980
could tell me I'm watching the movie

404
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,240
sing and I would totally believe you

405
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,459
don't you know anything about sarcasm I

406
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,560
think I had a talk at once will be

407
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,029
attempts to throw in a singular adult

408
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,350
joke but it's so obvious that their

409
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,670
punishments should be explaining the

410
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,079
birds and bees to every child who saw

411
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,269
this also this forces me to imagine at

412
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,410
orgasm it's just the third or fourth

413
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,089
time killing song montages movie has

414
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,500
made me suffer through I lost count

415
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,540
I'll just get my worthless scullery maid

416
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,220
to get another place setting ready for

417
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,220
the lovely lady mr. Spock

418
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,199
gristle only introduced Bridget as his

419
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,880
plus-one so the only way chef could know

420
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,199
her name is if the screenwriters were

421
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,339
committed to seeing Christine Baranski

422
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,010
to the hell out of this long laptop to

423
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,019
slow - what are we granting the reason

424
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,459
for this emotional renaissance - branch

425
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,720
sure he called the story about his

426
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,279
singing getting his grandma murdered but

427
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,029
it doesn't mean I'm sorry up stories so

428
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,220
big stupid yes help me be ready glitter

429
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,810
Sparkle Bridget should know that in

430
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,370
order to do this there will obviously be

431
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,199
no trolls to be served at ulfstead so

432
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,270
either way she screwed

433
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,920
and filmmakers really use the finest

434
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,390
vintage technology and music for this

435
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,220
workout montage between gristle working

436
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,200
up at Donna summers I feel loved Bridget

437
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,760
singing Lionel Richie solo branch

438
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,500
singing Bonnie Tyler's total clip to the

439
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,089
heart Kroll village singing Earth Wind

440
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:03,860
and Fire September and cool in the gang

441
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,810
celebration and branch and poppies Cyndi

442
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,029
Lauper True Colors do it was anyone even

443
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,880
thinking about the present day monster

444
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,440
casually stops months during long enough

445
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,760
for the trolls to assemble their escape

446
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,370
device how does this gate being

447
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,410
propelled exactly or steered I'm sick of

448
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,790
writing them you're sick of hearing them

449
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,290
but can we please rise above glitter

450
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,089
scream or is that just where we are as a

451
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,620
movie society you don't see that stuff

452
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,520
in Manchester by the feet all the trolls

453
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,649
survive this it can't be good

454
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,050
sorry papi we're too late yet another

455
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,700
fake out death for hippie troll Aldous

456
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,380
snow seriously we're really supposed to

457
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,520
feel anything for this character

458
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,200
he's been on screen for like two minutes

459
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,060
looks like trolls dis was traditionally

460
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,100
held out by the troll tree as kind of a

461
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,660
summer barbecue but now they're all

462
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,070
headed to the castle which definitely

463
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,149
doesn't look big enough to host the

464
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,649
entire town let alone for a formal

465
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:56,770
banquet now let's prepare the main car

466
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,150
Hopi needs to pick us I'd be a bonkers

467
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,560
fairy tale about a grim death for the

468
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,550
protagonists or a light-hearted

469
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,860
adventure for a pink Toyland are you

470
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,750
being sarcastic

471
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,070
Oh oh my god admit it you have expected

472
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,300
this character to poop himself out of

473
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
shock didn't you yes I wonder if a troll

474
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,660
loses its colour does it still bring

475
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,890
happiness to a burden that heats it

476
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,540
probably not right so why didn't they

477
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,040
just lose hope a long time ago and make

478
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,540
it useless for them to eat them also

479
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,770
aren't the cooks supposed to be

480
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,300
preparing the main course pretty sure

481
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,740
these trolls should be on a burner by

482
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:32,270
this point and I see your true mm-hmm

483
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,560
I've heard this is exactly what happens

484
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,000
to women and many men for that matter

485
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,529
when Justin Timberlake starts singing

486
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,270
this is nice a branch to lift everyone's

487
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,650
spirits and all but couldn't have gone

488
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,329
with a song that's more of a plan style

489
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:43,430
because as of now they're all still

490
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,230
gonna die and now they're all happy so

491
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,160
they're gonna be delicious

492
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,930
for the next machina seriously these

493
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,790
controls get amazingly lucky this whole

494
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,320
movie this is like Forrest Gump Ian

495
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,600
levels of luck I love you for that I

496
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,120
love you too Bridget for no other reason

497
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,589
this movie gives me except for

498
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,529
convenience there will be no fro until

499
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,320
the king

500
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,050
app1 has arrived well unless she doesn't

501
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,870
come at all but that's crazy talk who

502
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,670
wouldn't want to be with you chef is

503
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,110
acting like she's aware lady glitter

504
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,790
sparkles isn't going to show up but has

505
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,140
done nothing to make that happen or gain

506
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,000
that knowledge we did just ruined her

507
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,070
life to save ours it's not right that's

508
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,110
partly true it's not right but they're

509
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,670
actually probably going to kill her once

510
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,320
again how the hell is escape repelling

511
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,840
us out do you really think I can be

512
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,020
happy of course it's inside you it's

513
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,400
inside of all of us

514
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,630
I got this feeling bad my bone and by

515
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,490
inside you I mean this song will be

516
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,720
stuck inside your head for the next

517
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,230
three days

518
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,060
also it's obvious this entire movie was

519
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,590
just a setup for the song which was

520
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,270
released six months before this movie

521
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,130
came out in a cheap grab for the song of

522
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,440
the summer in 2016 wait what was I

523
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,480
talking about again got that good song I

524
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,340
must see all these bergens are still

525
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,780
hungry right it's the power of music

526
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,550
that much more than the power of hunger

527
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,410
because if it's 2 p.m. and I haven't

528
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,670
eaten there's no song in the

529
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,960
universe that's better than a Baconator

530
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,090
how the did all these trolls get in here

531
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,260
and we're already halfway through the

532
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,970
escape tunnel and the primary characters

533
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,079
were the only ones that crash through

534
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,820
the window I stopped Bergen does her

535
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,439
impression of your Aunt Linda when she

536
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,730
hears this song at Donna's wedding

537
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,680
reception all those cute happy little

538
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,939

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,110

545
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,570
as Princess feel like Daddy troll is

546
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,500

547
