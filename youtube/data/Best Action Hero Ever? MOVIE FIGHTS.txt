and the voice of the people she will be

66
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,799
the conduit of the online poll letting

67

68

question is Daniel Radford yes so I am

69
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,480
the voice of the people that is me so

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,100
the way that works is we have an

71
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,910
official poll on YouTube the poll or all

72
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,500
of the answers will go up after the

73
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,489
fighters have given their initial

74
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,690
arguments because we want this to be

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,370
about the arguments not about which one

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,130
you like better once that goes up go

77
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,380
ahead and vote and in the case of a tie

78
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,329
between judges that becomes our

79
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,980
tiebreaker but we'll make sure that we

80
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,049

Radford so again this is a best-of-seven

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,890
game the first player to achieve four

94
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,170
points wins there are three regular

95
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,060

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,030
combatants will move into the speed

97
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,470
round and then it's anybody's ballgame

98
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,280

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,630

furious comeback it has happened before

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,960

102
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,380

might be in the house so what yes hello

124
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,310
Ike I have to recuse myself today

125
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,050
because it wouldn't be fair for me to be

126
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,540
judging potentially my one of you three

127

128

138
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:06,510

139
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,520
what jte dropped that sickest package

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:22,500
[Music]

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,630
I love it alright guys or every time so

142
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,030
let's settle this once and for all big

143
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,980
question right out of the gate who's the

144
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,590
greatest action hero character in movie

145
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,240
history

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,310
greatest action hero character in movie

147
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,290
history and we start with player number

148
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,600
one mark M Draco I went with the

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,450
grandfather of them all James Bond he's

150
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,520
been in over 20 films now and has been

151
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,680
around since the late 50s I believe dr.

152
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,290
know was published in everything goes

153
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,790
back to him we wouldn't have Mission

154
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,650
Impossible without him you can tell

155
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,530
because MI is the abbreviation for

156
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,300
Mission Impossible which is also mi the

157
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,840
organization which Bond is from um it's

158
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,580
a character that has succeeded being

159
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,250
multiple actors so many other action

160
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,290
movie characters are so married to the

161
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,820
performer this character can be

162
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,140
reinvented he's sort of like Batman

163
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,070
without a costume you can always

164
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,169
reinvent him and we've been stealing

165
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,390
from these spy movies since they

166
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,310
originated and he's still valid today

167
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,600
he's even more successful than he was

168
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,150
when he first appeared in film alright

169
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,890
mark and Draco coming out of the gate

170
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,550
with James Bond so go over to Clark wolf

171
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,070
yes okay well um so I I went a little

172
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,440
different on this one for the greatest

173
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,350
action movie character I picked leia

174
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,520
organa now I I know that it's easy for

175
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,770
people to sort of write her off as a

176
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,050
love interest some of the lines the

177
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,820
iconic costumes like those are the

178
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,229
things that we talk about when we talk

179
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,660
about Leia but when I went back and

180
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,020
revisited these films it was amazing to

181
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,650
me how prolific and action-packed her

182
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,770
arc has been she has been in the fight

183
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,169
since the beginning and the thing that

184
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,300
really stands out to me the most about

185
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,720
her is that she in addition to being a

186
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,030
ground breaking character in a an iconic

187
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,010
series one of the most popular series of

188
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,430
all time she actually got to have an arc

189
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,160
we watched this character this fighter

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,400
start as a princess who is green and in

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,450
over her head and evolved into a general

192
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,960
a general who is using her skill set

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,789
who's still in the battle and still in

194
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,969
the fight even

195
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,300
decades later to to sort of fight for

196
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,969
the things that she that she believes in

197
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,060
so I I'm a big fan of the leia organa

198
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,639
character and that's why I picked her

199
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,560
Thank You Clark all right player number

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,310
three gregg allman my pick is sir Ethan

201
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,019
Hunt I've run the mission impossible

202
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,470
franchise was he knighted in my mind

203
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,819
here's okay to me he's the whole package

204
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,740
he's charming expert at hand-to-hand

205
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,470
combat expert with weapons gadgets but

206
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,959
he's not solely reliant on it he can

207
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,149
read lips - that's a nice plus he's a

208
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,500
killer on the motorcycle as you can see

209
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,269
in that photo and he could have on most

210
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:12,100
things on his own but he's also a great

211
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,389
team leader I feel like a lot of the

212
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,759
times action heroes are more just art

213
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,370
types and not really characters and what

214
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,750
this franchise has done so well and

215
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,939
uniquely done well is that you learn

216
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,949
about Ethan Hunt through his actions

217
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,050
he's constantly presented obstacles

218
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,750
where he has a mission and and then

219
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,009
there's like an innocent person in

220
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:32,019
danger and he'll take the time to save

221
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,300
that person pull us go through insane

222
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,339
obstacles like clearly we're on him he's

223
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:39,009
very human to complete that mission he

224
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,120
cares about more than just the mission

225
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,980
he cares about the world and he cares

226
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,750
about the ones around him and you'll

227
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,339
never see Ethan Hunt do one of those you

228
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,500
know like greater good sacrifices at the

229
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,899
expense of the ones he loves and the

230
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,009
innocent people around him yet he still

231
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,839
completes the mission plus you know it's

232
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,309
Tom Cruise so there's always a real

233
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:57,160
sense of danger and tension in the

234
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,779
action in the stunt moments because you

235
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,269
really feel like this Ethan Hunt is the

236
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,649
closest thing we'll have to a real-life

237
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,839
action hero spy and because of that out

238
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:06,309
of all these choices Ethan Hunt is a

239
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,050
character here with the most memorable

240
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,839
death-defying action sequences which Tom

241
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,519
Cruise manages to top with each new

242
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,899
installment as well as enriching the

243
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,300
character with each installment slug it

244
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,269
out fighters I think Leia is a fantastic

245
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,680
character and I think I was she got to

246
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,199
give a shout out to Gloria Katz who just

247
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,420
died it was the uncredited co-writer of

248
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,370
Star Wars who fought for Leia who did

249
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,540
all the great stuff for Leia

250
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,579
which was awesome that George Lucas even

251
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,559
back then was woke but I don't

252
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,790
necessarily think of her as an action

253
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,920
star I think of her as a character and

254
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,509
she's so married to Carrie Fisher I

255
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:38,980
don't think I don't ever think we're

256
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,089
gonna in our lifetime gonna see someone

257
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,949
else play her we've done animation and

258
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:42,819
video games yes but

259
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:46,779
the image is she's so ingrained and Jen

260
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,119
Ethan Hunt is an American version of

261
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,829
James Bond Mission Impossible was a TV

262
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,289
series inspired by James Bond he

263
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,269
wouldn't exist without I don't think

264
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,679
that makes him the best I don't think

265
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,539
shit makes James Bond the best oh just

266
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:00,309
because he started I feel like Ethan

267
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,410
Hunt especially in the films is a major

268
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,179
improvement over I think

269
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,100
bond is actually like pretty overrated I

270
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,049
think bonds boring I think he's more of

271
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,939
an archetype and not a real character oh

272
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,129
this is a great his pay his wife was

273
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,329
murdered there's so much it there's more

274
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,339
that's not really explored though and

275
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:17,199
that's not really felt nothing really

276
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,910
explored or felt with Tom Cruise in

277
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,769
those months totally disagreed addition

278
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,749
impossible three that's like so personal

279
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,609
and intense but at first ten minutes is

280
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,229
better than any bond part because

281
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,389
where's you're saying that James Bond

282
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,249
feels like an archetype Tom Cruise feels

283
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,019
like I'm watching Tom Cruise in a movie

284
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,999
he's charismatic and he's absolutely a

285
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,679
movie star but I watched that and I see

286
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,999
Tom Cruise playing a role I never

287
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,769
believed I never felt Ethan Hunt was a

288
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,199
real three-dimensional character now if

289
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,299
even if lay ahead all his action scenes

290
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:45,009
she'd she'd be the one to win

291
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,929
she's arguably one of the most important

292
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:48,339
female characters in the history of film

293
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,869
especially in genre because it was

294
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,909
always raised a forest and the women in

295
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,649
totally but I just don't I don't know

296
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,769
like if she fits in yeah and I figured

297
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,509
that this was gonna come up actually in

298
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,279
this conversation and that's part of the

299
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,109
reason why I wanted to do this fight

300
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:04,299
with her because when you go back and

301
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,589
you watch those movies

302
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,259
it's amazing how nitty-gritty she gets

303
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,389
in there it's Leia the facilitates

304
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,089
Luke's rescue of HA luke's rescue at the

305
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,429
end of empire layer rescues Han from

306
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,559
Carbonite she's the one who see it's

307
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,149
funny cuz when we think of Leia we think

308
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,069
of her in the sexy gold bikini but what

309
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,869
does she do in my gold bikini she

310
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,269
fucking strangles the hell out of Java

311
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,419
and gets in there I also feel it's fun

312
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,759
to watch at the end of empire watch Leia

313
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,609
Lando literally has to pull her away

314
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,100
from the conflict so I think that what's

315
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
hard is that we when we think about her

316
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,350
she's been so ingrained in pop culture

317
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,199
as you know this iconic figure but it's

318
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,789
amazing because she really does have

319
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,309
those action sequences it's not the

320
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,199
action sequences like you guys have

321
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,689
right with motorcycles and jumping off

322
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,579
of things and death-defying stunts but I

323
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:55,150
think

324
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,430
you guys actually made the argument for

325
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,800
why each of your character is characters

326
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,140
are kind of the weaker characters in

327
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,600
this argument you know and so I actually

328
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,880
agree with the notion is about action

329
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
hero though right I think there's an

330
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
argument to be made that Leia is an

331
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,950
action hero but she's certainly not the

332
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,410
best action hero of all time I think she

333
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,000
is I know these movie fights you gotta

334
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,839
say that but it's not true she's the

335
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,970
reason why I think she was she arguably

336
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,070
is one of the greatest action heroes of

337
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,690
all time in addition to being an

338
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,550
action-packed franchise and doing all

339
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,620
the things that I just mentioned all of

340
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,660
those examples of when she actually got

341
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,660
into the action we see the evolution of

342
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,570
her as an action hero we see you know

343
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,610
with both respectively with Ethan Hunt

344
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,250
and with James Bond I don't want to see

345
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,010
60-year old men you know still jumping

346
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,140
off of cliff cliffs and acting like this

347
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,480
is at all relatable I like that the

348
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,000
evolution of Leia's action hero is that

349
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,730
she's a general and she is in the fight

350
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,589
but not in the same way that she was

351
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,360
when a young woman when she was a young

352
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,950
woman which I think demonstrates a

353
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,310
mature arc for James were here I think

354
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,930
she's a good leader but that doesn't

355
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,060
make her a good action hero necessarily

356
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,010
and I think she's an amazing character I

357
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,480
think she's definitely one of the best

358
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,279
science fiction characters gender aside

359
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,010
up there but I don't think when I think

360
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,900
when you have asked the average person

361
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,000
action hero I don't think Princess Leia

362
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,950
is gonna be in the top ten even with

363
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,660
snot worse if you think alike you know

364
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,420
Han Solo or Luke Skywalker be the

365
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,279
problem thank you for illustrating that

366
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,380
point as well for me it's not about

367
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,940
gender I just don't think there's enough

368
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,650
when I think of Princess Leia I don't I

369
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,240
think of a couple of moments I think of

370
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,740
the help me obi-wan Kenobi you're my

371
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,480
only hope

372
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,310
I think it for strangling job but when

373
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,720
you when you say Ethan Hunt or when you

374
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,279
say James Bond you think of these big

375
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,529
action the events action is integral to

376
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,209
who they are she's a much I think she's

377
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,440
probably the smartest of all three of

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,640
these characters but I don't think

379
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,990
that's the question it's not the

380
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,029
question but I just have to keep going

381
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,800
back to the fact that we have been fed

382
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,980
over decades clip reels and you know

383
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,340
pounding into our heads lay

384
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,560
in certain ways but I am telling you

385
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,930
that if you re watching Empire if you re

386
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,320
watch return in the Jedi Leia is in the

387
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,240
fight and she has those action moments

388
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,070
but we don't celebrate them and we don't

389
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,830
talk about them because the way that

390
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,930
Leia is framed in our memories they're

391
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,760
not that impactful though those action

392
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,560
moments are not the big takeaways and I

393
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,510
think murdering Java isn't important

394
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,280
that's I mean I would I would certainly

395
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,440
disagree really think that if you like

396
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,570
look at force awakens and you see the

397
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,120
job that all like Han Luke and Leia have

398
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,920
done but if they're action heroes

399
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,420
they're clearly not good at their jobs

400
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,580
because nothing's changed since they

401
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,470
like since Leia became oh that's that's

402
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,240
a dr. political issue I mean that's

403
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,470
that's a political issue within the

404
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,790
world of Star Wars that's not what we're

405
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,470
talking about today but in talking about

406
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,960
the actions that Leia doesn't it like

407
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,360
them things you memorize about it and I

408
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,640
think to what James Bond I just don't

409
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,590
think I think the world around bond is

410
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,750
better than the character a bond bond is

411
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,610
cloud or same thing about Ethan Hunt I

412
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,350
would not I feel simply mission

413
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,820
impossible what do you think about when

414
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,380
you go to all those movies you think

415
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,570
about time you think about Ethan Hunt do

416
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,280
the I think about way more than that I

417
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,960
mean Mission Impossible 3 is probably my

418
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,030
favorite personal one because of the

419
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,860
fact of how intense and emotionally

420
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,780
personal that is you don't get that with

421
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,620
any of the bond

422
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,680
I mean with even like long days see when

423
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,300
you went personal with Ethan Hunt and

424
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,340
made the franchise better and it kept

425
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,810
getting better you went personal with

426
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,430
Bamba Casino Royale that was good but

427
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,350
ever since then the Bond franchise has

428
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,880
been confusing they don't know what to

429
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,540
do with it

430
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,130
I think the gadgets and stuff rakul but

431
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,960
Ethan Hunt is multi-skilled he's great

432
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,730
at working with people and the fact that

433
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,290
it's Tom Cruise that you associate with

434
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,390
him proves how nuanced it is you could

435
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,190
pretty much pause the blu-ray right here

436
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,190
and shift gears move into final thoughts

437
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,590
okay mark and Draco's darkness off I

438
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,730
don't think I don't think you thought

439
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,230
hunt will be a character after me after

440
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,850
Tom Cruise retires I think that

441
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,950
character is so integrally genetically

442
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,870
attached to Tom Cruise and I don't think

443
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,490
I think Tom Cruise is personality bring

444
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:53,820
stuff

445
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,830
I think Leia is a great character but in

446
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,900
my mind the additives of in front of her

447
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
name action is not one of the top five

448
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,850
without James Bond so much wouldn't

449
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,140
exist in the fact that his movies still

450
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,580
make billions of dollars today or

451
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,530
they're more successful than ever shows

452
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,459
that he's a character that can be

453
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,350
reinvented and be viable forever for

454
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,370
everyone else I think his

455
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,319
so I think he's the father of even huh

456
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,520
that'll be a great for a nice crossover

457
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,630
action okay as James Bond Ethan hunts

458
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,640
daddy Clark yes okay so let's go back to

459
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,740
I think what the other two competitors

460
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,250
are trying to do to to break apart my

461
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,550
argument action hero right I firmly

462
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,410
believe that you have to ask yourself

463
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,980
the question what makes a hero and and

464
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,840
then on top of that what makes a

465
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,780
complete action hero with both of the

466
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,790
other two franchises you get glimpses

467
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,490
and glimmers into actual character an

468
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,890
actual story but at the end of the day I

469
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,300
feel like the stunts probably overshadow

470
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,100
what could make those characters

471
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,870
compelling and interesting and with

472
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,730
somebody like Leia once again I've

473
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,730
already cited examples of her getting

474
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,980
into the action and fighting but at the

475
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,710
end of the day Leia to me is a complete

476
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,320
action hero we're on top of the cool

477
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
spectacle and on top of getting into the

478
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
fray we see an actual and realistic

479
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,000
evolution and arc of an action hero

480
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,610
meaning we watch her age gracefully and

481
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,429
see how her being involved in the action

482
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:28,110
it changes and grows into a more

483
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,420
realistic portrayal frankly with her

484
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,460
becoming in general Thank You Clark

485
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,420
Gregg I mean if you want to talk about

486
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,059
action hero and though the one character

487
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,010
here who actually has sequences that

488
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,590
people really remember and are really

489
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,480
impactful fide and actually feel the

490
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,580
intensity of it Mission Impossible three

491
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,110
the running chase scene all the debye

492
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,059
sequences in Ghost Protocol the

493
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,250
motorcycle chase scenes in rogue nation

494
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,710
the underwater sequence fall out the

495
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,900
helicopter chase but beyond just the

496
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,490
physical action scenes where he's the

497
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,500
only one here who we really believe is

498
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,600
capable of all these things I think the

499
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,300
fact that Tom Cruise is the only one who

500
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,610
plays him proves a level of nuance any

501
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,530
good-looking guy with decent acting

502
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,210
chops who can do a British accent and

503
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,679
maybe get a little more physically fit

504
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,260
can play James Bond it's really a

505
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,700
OneNote character who's like a

506
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,550
misogynistic womanizing alcoholic he's

507
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,950
not a very interesting dude and Princess

508
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,260
laya for me she was really good for her

509
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,660
time but she's not the action hero we're

510
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,980
not even really thought of to be one she

511
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,660
doesn't flash to mind as an action here

512
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,490
just because she's iconic doesn't mean

513
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,020
that you're gonna go oh she's the action

514
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,210
hero of that franchise bond to me is one

515
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,730
note Ethan Hunt demonstrates a variety

516
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,850
of so many skills plus he has leadership

517
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,040
qualities bond doesn't work well with

518
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,420
others Ethan Hunt knows how to solely

519
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,490
rely on himself and he and he

520
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,020
demonstrates all those qualities hey

521
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,360
mark I do demonstrate all those

522
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,550
qualities and just because I like you're

523
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,130
talking about bond came first but it's

524
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,740
like Bruce Lee came before a Jackie Chan

525
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,180
but I think Jackie Chan's fight scenes

526
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,590
are better than Bruce Lee that doesn't

527
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,940
necessarily mean that oh I think Bruce

528
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,200
Lee's a better fighter but I think

529
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,370
Jackie Chan's Fighting's a better same

530
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,840
thing I would stay with Ethan on I think

531
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,910
bonds a terrible spy he always says his

532
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,270
name and he also always gets caught he

533
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,220
always gets caught I think Ethan Hunt is

534
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,200
actually someone who proves he's a damn

535
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,090
good spy he doesn't shoot first and then

536
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,310
ask questions later he actually does spy

537
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,050
work any more hot takes

538
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,480
ring-a-ding-ding that's round one all

539
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,390
right the pinyon based game it sure is

540
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,210
it sure is feel free to add Greg about

541
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,580
that Bruce Lee stuff all right

542
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,790
foul nation yes thank you sir hashtag

543
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,040
alum nation law and facts what's going

544
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,650
on a few a few facts mostly to confirm

545
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,050
actually uh mark said that dr. Noah was

546
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,450
first published in 1958 or 59 he was

547
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,760
right on the money it was 1958 he also

548
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,040
said doctor note like the the Bond films

549
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,020
are making more money than they ever

550
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,830
have before

551
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,930
it is also correct doctor no grossed

552
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,420
about 16 million in 1968 that works out

553
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,220
today to about a hundred and sixteen

554
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,910
million dollars

555
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,330
Spectre gross 200 million into 2015 so

556
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,620
the bond fills our more popular

557
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,270
internationally today than they were

558
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,310
when they first came out Ethan Hunt is

559
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,300
not a knight everybody thank and the

560
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,370
last thing about Bruce Lee versus Jackie

561
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,410
Chan I would encourage our viewers to

562
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,670
sound off about that in the comments

563
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,840
it's a it's a

564
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,950
I'll give you a branch phone number if

565
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,659
you want yeah but right on thank you on

566
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,070
alright let's talk about this mark I'm

567
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,330
gonna talk about it first that means not

568
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,000
gonna win the point yeah I'm here soon

569
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,389
next year this is this seat as always

570
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:41,429
yeah James Bond a great character I just

571
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:42,870
feel like there wasn't quite enough

572
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,639
there like he started at all that

573
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,860
doesn't mean he's the best and I think

574
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,120
Greg hit you on he was a little bit

575
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,340
OneNote and also like some of the in the

576
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,289
final thoughts the stuff about him being

577
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,539
a misogynistic alcoholic like you could

578
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,029
there's a lot of stuff written about

579
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,799
that that's really interesting that

580
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,539
could also take him down a peg great

581
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,760
character I love all the bonds but yeah

582
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,590
you're not gonna take it so it came down

583
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,649
to Clark and Greg from it for me Clark

584
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,000
it felt to me like you were trying to

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,470
fit a round peg into a square hole and

586
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,360
but then you started to sell me you

587
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,510
really started to open my eyes onto like

588
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,340
how big of the arc and what kind of

589
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,760
character she is and she does just get

590
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,470
put in this box as love interest and

591
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,320
people don't respect the journey so you

592
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,210
really open my eyes to the journey but

593
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,010
when I go back to the question who is

594
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,590
the greatest action hero character in

595
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,880
movie history um to me she is not that

596
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,139
even though you opened my eyes I feel

597
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:45,929
like they kind of dinged you on that and

598
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,570
to the very essence of the question it's

599
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,240
Greg yeah you sold me on several

600
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,279
different levels including like yeah

601
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,130
you're like just what you took as a

602
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,029
negative

603
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,889
it's just Tom Cruise Tom cruising around

604
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:01,260
but he's putting his body on the line

605
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,049
and Greg say like the way Greg said it

606
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,450
makes viewing it more that much more

607
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,340
compelling so people are not making

608
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,289
James Bond movies and the stunts so that

609
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,960
that's not a really valuable overhanging

610
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,850
okay yeah Greg gets it for me long

611
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,350
pretty good argument on a huge James

612
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,909
Bond fan he would have been my pick out

613
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:23,039
of all three of these answers but yeah I

614
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,539
sort of agree with you how I feel like

615
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,159
Mark could have made a stronger case and

616
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,230
Greg was really crapping on the

617
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,909
character I I wanted you to come back

618
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:37,120
and more forcefully I kind of

619
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,799
you know he was he was the first but

620
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,450
also here's all of these sort of

621
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,520
archetypal things that bond sort of put

622
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,320
in place III didn't necessarily hear a

623
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,090
lot of that so it did come down to Clark

624
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,159
versus Greg for me I gotta be honest I

625
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,840
wasn't really too swayed by the like

626
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,630
she's not an action character like yes

627
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,159
you know she's not doing stunts she's

628
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,659
not jumping out of things like Tom

629
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,419
Cruise but she's a woman of action and I

630
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:01,010
really liked clerks arguing about how

631
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,929
you know her sort of grow through this

632
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:04,340
year she becomes a general she's like

633
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,770
the leader at the end so even though not

634
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,510
a conventional pick I'm going with Clark

635
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,080
okay

636
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,750
and there we go yeah jte thank you for

637
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:20,049
taking that point back from Greg's

638
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:22,789
Florida oh my gosh

639
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:26,600
okay so we are locked up at one one and

640
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,399
the audience is going to decide Danielle

641
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:31,370
audience is gonna say all right well

642
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,679
with 52 percent it is even 29 percent

643
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,110
James Bond and 17 percent

644
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,740
give me that point GT sweet vindication

645
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,159
for jay-z so one of the comments and I

646
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,279
saw that on Twitter now we had a lot of

647
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,169
people very heavily we had some indiana

action hero in movie history Snake

Plissken is doing the madness with half

00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:11,750
yeah there's so many

655
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,100
I love Ripley from aliens JT ease I saw

656
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,260
that tweet come through Rambo that's a

657
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,140
classic one yeah a lot of good ones out

658
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,059
there I'm buying Paige rivet you know

659
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,330
who actually is it's Ethan Hunt and Greg

660
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,980
takes a 100 I into round number two all

661
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,529
right mark and Clark looking to get on

662
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,380
the board mark and Clark yes yes d isn't

663
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,390
needed all right so with Halloween

664
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,070
child's play Friday the 13th and now

665
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,649
news of Candyman don't say his name five

666
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,230
times all getting revivals

667
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,559
what horror franchise should be buried

668
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,510
for good and that means no more sequels

669
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,940
no reboots no revivals we are done with

670
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,250
that franchise forever which one do you

671
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,049
want to see go away and we're gonna

672
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,490
start with player number two for

673
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,030
question number two Clark okay so I went

674
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,160
with scream for this one

675
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,679
you know the reason actually for me is

676
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,640
threefold

677
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,340
first of all story wise I think that

678
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,309
scream is so tied to Sidney Prescott as

679
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,309
a character and I don't see any reason

680
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,330
why the ghost face mask because as we

681
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,730
know the killers are all different in

682
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,460
there I know but I didn't say who they

683
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,640
were

684
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,190
haha so you just know they're not the

685
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,169
same person over and over again but so

686
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:32,750
the mask is is sort of the ghost face

687
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,059
the gospace villain and and that to me

688
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,460
is not a compelling enough reason to

689
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,320
continue the franchise forward in

690
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,730
addition to that from a business

691
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,640
perspective I think that we've seen that

692
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,070
whether it's on film or on television

693
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,340
they just you know it's not working

694
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,410
audiences just aren't here for it you

695
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,580
know when you're talking about these

696
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,290
slasher movies that are being rebooted

697
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,150
whether it's Michael Mayer or Halloween

698
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,160
or it's right into the 13th these are

699
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,980
characters that are you know haunting

700
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,520
that are haunting the the final girl

701
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,910
whereas with scream it's it's it's just

702
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,940
the mask and finally out of respect Wes

703
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,950
Craven is so does it and this is a

704
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,600
personal preference but I do think it's

705
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,280
a compelling argument for why I think we

706
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,840
should be done with scream and that's

707
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,150
Wes Craven I think is as tied to that

708
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,799
franchise as Kevin Williamson the writer

709
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,679
is and and Wes Craven has passed on he

710
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,410
directed all of the scream films and I

711
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,860
think we see without his touch and

712
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,840
creative influence you know the show's

713
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,419
is just lackluster so I think that we're

714
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,380
done with scream thanks Clark Greg I'm

715
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,410
going with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre

716
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,860
there was only one good movie out of

717
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,840
this entire franchise that's not that

718
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,350
one on the screen right now I know and

719
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,510
out of eight of those movies I think

720
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,530
there was eight you can fact check me

721
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,450
there there was only one other one that

722
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,140
was okay

723
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,720
and that was the remake of the good one

724
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,760
as the only okay one I'll say the best

725
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,950
thing to follow up the first the

726
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,450
original Texas Chainsaw that was good

727
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,190
was the teaser trailer for the remake

728
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,900
which did you guys remember that it's

729
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,790
like not in the movie but it's awesome

730
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,110
that's the only good thing was that the

731
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,340
one with the sound effect yeah all the

732
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,740
Texas Chain Saw films are the exact same

733
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,270
you know it's young people usually on

734
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,880
some kind of road trip who encounters

735
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,980
some cannibal Hicks who are in love with

736
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,680
their creepy son Leatherface and even

737
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,110
when they have a setup that seems like

738
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,800
it's something new they always evolve

739
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,850
into the exact same movie and I think

740
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,800
there and there is I saw the most recent

741
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,620
one that came out last year and no one

742
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,190
saw that one but me oh you saw it okay

743
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,930
and most people didn't see it it made

744
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,090
like no money every time you think this

745
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,280
franchise is dead they they keep

746
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,530
bringing it back for some reason and yet

747
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,510
if you go I'm like even Rotten Tomatoes

748
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,570
critics and audience score all around

749
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,800
after the first one are just it's just

750
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,350
bad it's bad it's not good should be

751
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,570
ended and no ideas no more ideas thanks

752
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,610
Greg mark I was gonna pick the Madea

753
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,030
franchise but then I realized there's a

754
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,260
lot of character development over those

755
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,270
movies I Tyler Perry has said he's not

756
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,890
gonna play Mindy any more one more movie

757
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,720
is one more name madea's family reunion

758
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,420
of family funeral you know yeah alright

759
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,020
hey Madea mark continue um I picked the

760
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,960
purge because unlike scream and Texas

761
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,120
Chainsaw Massacre the first scream is a

762
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,250
zeitgeist movie that is one of the still

763
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,900
watchable and groundbreaking and

764
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,610
brilliant and arguably the best directed

765
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,230
thing but scoop with Wes Craven did in

766
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,760
his entire career and probably the best

767
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,250
thing Kevin Williamson ever wrote Texas

768
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,690
Chainsaw Massacre I argued this last

769
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,560
time when we were talking about

770
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,690
franchises to sell that episode the

771
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,100
first Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a

772
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,960
classic as a genre stablish for the rest

773
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,700
of them as you said are the same thing

774
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,860
an awful but the purge had nothing the

775
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,210
purge was what if we could kill people

776
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,800
because we didn't like people and that's

777
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,690
I can watch that on Fox News there's

778
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,660
nothing it's torture porn adjacent it's

779
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,940
it's it's just the same beats with

780
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,650
characters that are so thinly drawn you

781
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,930
wish Ghostface or Leatherface would show

782
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,980
up and kill them because at least

783
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,180
there'd be somebody interesting in these

784
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,760
movies when Frank Grillo is your anchor

785
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,440
in star you're French I should probably

786
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,530
be buried it's a divisive not funny not

787
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,660
clever torture porn II franchise that

788
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,390
that now has a TV series and explicably

789
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,460
and is actually worse than the screen TV

790
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,010
series which is blow low-hanging fruit

791
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,690
it's just there's there's no there there

792
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,520
at least with these two they sprang from

793
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,950
something great this was just this was

794
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,410
just leftover garbage they put on film

795
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,730
all right somewhere Frank Grillo is like

796
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,500
what I do all right find it out he'll be

797
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,920
fine

798
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,900
no I actually have to disagree with you

799
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,120
mark in that there's no there there I

800
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,090
think that the purge franchise had the

801
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,940
potential to be one of the greatest

802
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,770
freight hauler franchises and genre

803
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,170
franchise ever now I will go to bat for

804
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,270
the first but not the first purge as in

805
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,690
the title but the 2013 purge yes yes but

806
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,610
I do like the first purge and I'll get

807
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,400
to that a second but with 2013 the purge

808
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,800
I actually think that movie is a lot

809
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,450
better than people give it credit for

810
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,330
and I do think that where they took the

811
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,820
franchise in terms of a different year

812
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,160
and a different style of film was very

813
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,610
smart

814
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,490
it has had misses for sure but the

815
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,220
potential to tell an incredible story is

816
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,630
still there yeah and that's why it

817
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,460
should not be buried if anything they

818
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,050
should keep trying because we could

819
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,960
still really get the cusp of getting six

820
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,700
of them in a TV series they've done for

821
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,070
them and well don't forget Fast Five

822
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,720
that when the franchise turned around

823
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,480
and I think perch has the potential this

824
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,950
is the only one out of all three choices

825
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,660
that has the potential to actually do

826
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,490
some exploration I think the only

827
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,260
problem with the purge franchises if

828
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,270
they just changed the writers I've had

829
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,370
the same writer for all of them James

830
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,800
demonaco and literally if you look at

831
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,990
like the consensus for the last three

832
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,940
they're always like the mid 50 range of

833
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,080
Rotten Tomatoes because they're just

834
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,420
right there they always have a cool new

835
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,130
set up have a new idea and there's so

836
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,170
much you can do with like sociological

837
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,390
socio politics psychological elements

838
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,580
and the movies always are about to get

839
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,170
there so they're just look how many

840
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,210
bites at the Apple do they get well

841
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,430
demonaco did not direct the first the

842
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,020
first purchase and the one that came out

843
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,000
recently so the title is the first purge

844
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,220
recently yes he did and I think that

845
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,660
that is a great step in the right

846
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,030
direction visually I loved the first

847
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,590
purge and also some of those

848
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,740
performances were fantastic now I know

849
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,690
it's a controversial movie in terms of

850
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,570
this actual story but you know using

851
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,670
that franchise to have these

852
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,430
conversations is desperately needed and

853
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,840
at the end of the day that is what

854
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,570
horror is supposed agree with you that

855
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,310
horror can be a political thing you know

856
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,420
it's like we might as a living dead as a

857
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,520
response to the Vietnam War and a killer

858
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,440
clown with our killer clown in office

859
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,360
but I think the purge I think it's I

860
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,680
think you're both smart and you're

861
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,140
projecting stuff on there it's there you

862
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,280
could say that the ingredients in

863
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,960
McDonald's can make a gourmet meal but

864
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,490
they don't make them at McDonald's and I

865
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,140
don't think the purge that potential is

866
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,640
just laying fallow it's we're projecting

867
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,770
our own socio-political stuff and our

868
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,110
own ideas about what that would be like

869
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,700
in the real world but that's just from

870
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,380
the concept the movie never pays all

871
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,120
that the idea is talked a lot about the

872
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,060
purge I haven't heard a scream I really

873
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,100
like I think I don't think we need a

874
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,010
sequel for scream right now and I don't

875
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,660
think we need any more Sidney Prescott

876
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,490
movies but I got to disagree about the

877
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,400
shows I think I think you can fact check

878
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,120
this lawn

879
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,490
I believe the season 2 of scream this

880
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,990
show I know that's not the movie but the

881
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,550
franchise was still continuing in that

882
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,960
department and the questions about what

883
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,700
franchise should stop that got a high

884
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,500
critics score and a high audience score

885
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,420
and I believe season 1 also got a high

886
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,640
audience score showing that those those

887
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,890
shows the show was receptive and you

888
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,600
didn't need Wes Craven to direct every

889
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,430
episode and it also has a bunch of

890
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,750
different writers working on that show

891
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,460
so you can take the concept of screen

892
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,400
and still continue well because scream

893
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,650
is about commentary on horror movies and

894
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,810
as long as horror keeps continuing you

895
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,800
can still do commentary

896
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,050
scream is not about commentary on horror

897
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,690
movies that is definitely a feature of

898
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,419
the first handful of screen movies but

899
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:18,100
but that is not what that franchise is

900
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,370
about regardless I think that scream

901
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,970
that on television has proven to be not

902
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,470
the success that MTV wanted in that

903
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,349
rebooted their reboot so clearly

904
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,510
something is not working but I want to

905
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,800
go back to Texas Chainsaw Massacre

906
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,419
because something that you said earlier

907
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,179
was that nobody is nobody's really

908
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,580
interested in these movies and the fact

909
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,889
of the matter is in 2013 when I would

910
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,540
argue our current horror Renaissance

911
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,230
kicked off Texas Chainsaw Massacre was

912
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,179
the one that blew the doors off of

913
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,290
January 2013 with a huge box office so

914
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,380
the appetite is still there for that

915
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,050
franchise and honestly as you know and I

916
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,210
know you know you know a lot of people

917
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,859
read tobe Hooper's first movie as a

918
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,020
commentary on sort of like the despair

919
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,240
the differences between class and like

920
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,150
the idea that you know we're you you you

921
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,830
know these kids come into this world

922
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,869
that they don't particularly understand

923
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,050
and and are confronted with with this

924
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,090
different type of lifestyle and I think

925
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,460
if anything that is a brilliant thing

926
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,770
that we could easily explore it may be

927
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,270
in them if you got a director like let's

928
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,550
say Alex aza like he did with Hills Have

929
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,800
Eyes and reboot that I think you just

930
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,540
happy he we could really do something

931
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,900
with gentrifying that part of Texas just

932
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,660
keep rebooting the same movie don't do

933
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,580
it even the remake didn't do anything

934
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,440
that different other than aesthetic

935
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,150
there was really nothing a plot point

936
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,670
story wise they're all be exact for

937
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,980
development about the character of

938
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,750
Leatherface and I don't like the remakes

939
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,190
or the sequels at all but there's more

940
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,020
development about of Leatherface is a

941
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,339
character then there is Ethan Hunt in

942
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,560
the Mission Impossible Leatherface

943
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,240
origin movies and not one of them

944
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,010
commits to being an origin

945
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,660
alright let's shift gears no to final

946
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,900
thoughts Clark okay so I I feel like the

947
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,080
purge is untapped potential I like the

948
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,089
first purge movie and I like the first

949
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:23,550
purge and and I think that there's

950
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,990
something really important there and

951
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,000
same with Texas Chainsaw frankly I think

952
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,220
if you go back to those roots that tobe

953
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,630
Hooper established there is some

954
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,320
brilliant commentary on class and and

955
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,890
and and in the South where I am from and

956
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,680
and

957
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,600
whole mess of other things but at the

958
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,700
end of the day scream as I have

959
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,710
mentioned you know the movies I would

960
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,810
argue sort of dwindled in quality over

961
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:50,110
time and and with the TV show they

962
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,380
literally just rebooted the TV show that

963
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,110
was the reboot clearly this franchise

964
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,240
without the magic of Kevin Williamson

965
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,180
and the magic of Wes Craven just isn't

966
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,100
worth continuing so at the end of the

967
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,200
day let's let this go let's create

968
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,680
another slasher killer that wears a mask

969
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,900
and stalks teenagers like it's literally

970
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,820
every other slasher movie the thing that

971
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,190
made scream important and made it stand

972
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,300
out is is is attached to Kevin

973
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,190
Williamson and Wes Craven and at the end

974
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,480
of the day Wes is gone Greg okay I think

975
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,050
I think if he did scream movie every

976
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,780
five to ten years it would be good cuz I

977
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,880
personally believe that one of the

978
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,620
biggest coolest things about the screen

979
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,930
franchise is the fact that it does do

980
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,450
commentary on horror movies today it's

981
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,980
not a spoof of them but it is a

982
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,170
commentary on them I think that's why

983
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,290
scream 4 is better than scream 3 scream

984
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,240
3 came a little bit after scream 2 but

985
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,950
then they waited a while they did four

986
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,020
and four definitely got a more positive

987
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,390
response as opposed to three I also

988
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,950
think the show's definitely got good

989
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,740
audience scores so I mean maybe be on

990
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,630
MTV wasn't a good idea but as far for

991
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,280
the people who watched it they liked it

992
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,580
the purge is the only like scream is the

993
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,320
best franchise out of all three of these

994
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,720
franchises screams the one that actually

995
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,220
has a pretty good amount of good

996
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,800
material consistently the purge movies

997
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,960
is the only one that actually would make

998
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,550
sense to keep having sequels I think

999
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,110
like like what you're talking about

1000
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,370
what's going on in the world today I

1001
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,260
mean everything about like what's going

1002
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,520
on with gun violence lately and how the

1003
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,160
purge can if they just teetered a little

1004
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,170
bit more in the end it's like got a

1005
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,940
different writer you can do so much

1006
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,310
awesome exploration it sets itself up

1007
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,840
with this really cool concept in world

1008
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,280
and that's why audiences keep tuning in

1009
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,170
for it because of the fact that it's the

1010
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,030
only one there that really has potential

1011
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,720
for sequels Texas Chainsaw Massacre

1012
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,890
there have been eight of these and they

1013
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,020
drastically keep declining in box-office

1014
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,720
return no I can't think the only good

1015
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,570
one is the first one and and they

1016
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,060
unlike the perch which has changed up

1017
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,140
its directors and they got a new

1018
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,970
creative people on it scream which has

1019
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,530
had a little bit of a success with

1020
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,210
audiences with having different creative

1021
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,850
types on the show the Texas always

1022
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,860
changes it up and they never deliver a

1023
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,970
good movie because there's simply

1024
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,730
nothing more to tell with it other than

1025
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,710
what the first movie gave mark and Draco

1026
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,290
um you know I think I think the fact

1027
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,630
that if you do a top 10 list of horror

1028
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,370
movies from most critics and most dire

1029
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,200
horror fans both scream 1 and Texas

1030
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,970
Chainsaw Massacre will be on there this

1031
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,070
is a fun it's a this is a passable

1032
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,040
franchise it's it's mediocre at best all

1033
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,600
this is all the stuff we're putting into

1034
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,590
it that they're putting into it about

1035
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,300
commenting on society and stuff now is

1036
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,400
never touched upon there this this this

1037
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,140
show this movie series and the TV show

1038
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,760
fetishized violence and fetish and

1039
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,070
glamorize that it's it's it's hostile

1040
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,220
adjacent whereas I think screams should

1041
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,480
be put on hold for a while but I would

1042
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,980
like to in 10 years see the kid who

1043
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,690
first the first horror movie he saw was

1044
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,910
scream and the meta take then I think we

1045
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,490
need time for this one part arguing

1046
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,260
about you I want to write the one about

1047
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,850
gentrification in Texas now because

1048
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,710
there's something new there this is just

1049
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,060
one night a year people are gonna kill

1050
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,830
them kill each other and there's gonna

1051
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,270
be the inherit political stuff that we

1052
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,530
bring into it ourselves but you're

1053
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,630
bringing that on as an audience members

1054
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,550
it's never touched upon in the film it's

1055
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,920
just grind house stuff and there's no

1056
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,420
central character there's nothing to

1057
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,890
latch upon other than it says one night

1058
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,900
it's just an utterly unsatisfying

1059
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,690
marginal horror film that is is it gonna

1060
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,640
be is not going to be remember these two

1061
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,350
films are have classics and might both

1062
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,240
need breathers but I want to see these

1063
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,500
there's nowhere to go with this we're

1064
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,120
gonna do for a purge it's now a week

1065
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,880
it's now Arbor Day it's now this it says

1066
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,740
it's just it's just a one note thing

1067
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,690
with diminishing returns purge Arbor Day

1068
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,380
coming soon

1069
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,450
ring-a-ding-ding that is round two all

1070
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,580
right let's see who we're gonna bury and

1071
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,550
lawn facts and also give us your

1072
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,580
thoughts on the round quickly with facts

1073
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,220
season 2 of scream tomato meter rating

1074
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,790
83% audience score 78% a lot higher than

1075
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,470
the first season so Greg was right there

1076
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,210
are some fans of season 2 of that show

1077
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,460
there are eight total films in the texas

1078
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,410
chainsaw series the most recent one was

1079
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,240
Leatherface which was released last year

1080
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,940
that was a prequel to the 24th of the

1081
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,450
1974 original and there are

1082
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,089
purge film so that doesn't on fact this

1083
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,220
was tough guy I various points during

1084
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,349
this round I was ready to give the point

1085
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:11,329
to each of our three fighters I don't

1086
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:13,310
think anybody got blown out I think they

1087
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,869
all made compelling arguments but it

1088
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,730
eventually did come down at the end

1089
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,250
I thought Gregg had a really great final

1090
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,230
comment and I thought he really did kind

1091
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,700
of have arguments that knocked out the

1092
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,280
other two purged they've never done a

1093
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,619
good one at least spoiling marks line of

1094
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:28,700
thinking I kind of liked the first four

1095
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,829
as well but so there's room to to use

1096
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:32,750
that and then the same thing with scream

1097
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,490
like well it could be relevant because

1098
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,780
there could be new commentary on our

1099
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,550
movies so I thought Texas Chainsaw takes

1100
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,369
this one you know what I've similar

1101
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,630
thoughts to lon

1102
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,570
I feel like good arguments were made as

1103
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,060
to what we would want to see from the

1104
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,280
purge how it there is more to be

1105
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,680
explored there and then the fact that it

1106
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,480
seems like people are still enjoying

1107
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,550
these like scream and different

1108
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,400
incarnations I felt like that was like

1109
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,220
just an interesting thought to be had

1110
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,599
there and yeah Greg you just you kind of

1111
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,180
bludgeoned us with the chainsaw of like

1112
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,190
oh it's the same thing over and over

1113
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,380
again and you got me not wanting to see

1114
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,780
it anymore the most so I got to go Greg

1115
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,170
as well so Greg takes the point there

1116
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,119
Danielle what's everybody saying all

1117
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,940
right so we've got Texas Chainsaw

1118
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,400
Massacre with 47% 26% for the purge and

1119
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,550
25% for scream over are other things

1120
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,380
that have been mentioned a lot of people

1121
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,700
say saw is dunzo oh yeah a lot of people

1122
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,240
are also real over Chucky now over on

1123
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,060
Twitter at Corin underscore w says the

1124
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,069
Amityville franchise needs to be buried

1125
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:49,160
out of the 20 ish sequels adaptation

1126
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,500
spin-offs direct-to-video stuff she's a

1127
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,150
different work there's everything maybe

1128
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,950
two decent movies the rest have been

1129
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,869
total dumpster fires give it up already

1130
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:59,030
and shut it down I'm also hearing rumors

1131
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,500

1150
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,720
Internet did big business over the

1151
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,030
weekend surprisingly beating out Robin

1152
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,460
Hood

1153
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,720

1158
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,079
I just to read my log line yeah

1159
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,270
based on the same Disney Princess role

1160
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,579
as in Ralph breaks the Ennis breaks the

1161
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,079
internet breaks the innocent predicts

1162
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,300
the Internet Maleficent along with the

1163
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,130
help of other Disney animated villains

1164
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,720
breaks into the Marvel section and

1165
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,599
steals Thanos's Infinity Gauntlet after

1166
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,030
she uses it to snap away all the princes

1167
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,920
the male princess so she and her cohorts

1168
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,780
can finally prevail against the pesky

1169
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,270
princesses the princess says who so long

1170
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,160
relied on their men like Aurora Snow

1171
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,349
White Cinderella and Belle must form an

1172
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:48,760
alliance with the tougher princesses

1173
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,950
like Mulan Maria and the things they say

1174
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,050
at Moana to exact revenge against

1175
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,849
Maleficent and her league of villains in

1176
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:59,200
my movie that I call vault Disney whoa

1177
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,420
all right great coming in with vault

1178
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,660
Disney and ambitious team-up mark mine

1179
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,460
is a sort of Ocean's eleven meets

1180
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,030
Fantasia it's all the Disney Princesses

1181
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,290
all the villainous is who have been

1182
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,880
killed or vanished in all the other

1183
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,310
movies have gone to the Balrog and made

1184
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,650
a deal with him to take all the

1185
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,359
princesses from the girl so they can be

1186
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,060
their male

1187
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,010
so they're them they're the screaming

1188
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,450
women in jeopardy they're the Fae array

1189
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,370
and all the different princesses all

1190
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,720
have a different skill set have to

1191
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,190
figure out have to come together and

1192
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,840
figure out a way to break into Bald

1193
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Mountain and not only save their men but

1194
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,720
defeat the devil and you it's a crosses

1195
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,830
over the different the different

1196
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,270
boundaries you could do multiple types

1197
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:54,320
of animal rock cousins but you embrace

1198
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,570
the history of Disney going back to they

1199
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,400
have you know what advice I would use is

1200
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,600
they have to get the magic mirror they

1201
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,040
have to steal the magic mirror from the

1202
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,420
print from the Evil Queen from Snow

1203
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,580
White because that was the device to get

1204
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,890
in to bring the Chernabog out there and

1205
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,510
capture all the princesses and by

1206
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,040
flipping it on their heads by having the

1207
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,110
men be the women in jeopardy and the

1208
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,390
women team up and rescue them in a caper

1209
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,980
that has some supernatural stuff and

1210
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,670
some fun stuff all right thank you

1211
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,700
Clark so my pitch is a little different

1212
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,400
than than there's uh my pitches that

1213
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,420
Belle and tiana team up together and

1214
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,690
they go they become pirates and we

1215
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,160
reboot the Pirates of the Caribbean

1216
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,010
franchise with Belle and Tiana and they

1217
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,590
go on an exploration around the world

1218
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,590
together being pirates landing in

1219
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,540
different ports exploring going on

1220
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,150
adventures and there's a fun cameo by

1221
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,100
Ariel who has now been turned back into

1222
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,740
a mermaid so she so she's there and she

1223
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:57,440
says hello okay find it out okay

1224
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,550
gentlemen

1225
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,340
I got it I got a I'm sorry I don't want

1226
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,020
to play this card in in a disrespectful

1227
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,780
way but literally both of your pitches

1228
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,520
are about the girls saving men why what

1229
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,400
why why is this our why is this what the

1230
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,160
princesses have to do I am just like

1231
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,160
flabbergasted esteem oh it's a princess

1232
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,140
tema move exactly so can we hang out

1233
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,490
with

1234
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:28,270
them rescue and save the boys like I

1235
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,740
just feel like if we're going to

1236
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,380
actually do a princess team up movie we

1237
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,720
need to actually dive into what they're

1238
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,490
interested in and something tells me

1239
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,280
that it is not rescuing semester them

1240
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,970
rebooting Pirates of the Caribbean for

1241
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,590
me it's not about them rescuing the men

1242
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,060
because they're defined by their men

1243
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,740
that's that's flipping the archetypes of

1244
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,000
the hero's story where there's always a

1245
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,470
damsel in distress

1246
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,660
women have to come together with all

1247
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,950
their different skill sets and they all

1248
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,450
like in the Ocean's eleven franchise

1249
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,010
they all get a spotlight of what their

1250
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,020
skill sets are in team up and it's

1251
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,090
empowering they don't need they don't

1252
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,580
because they love it you know I

1253
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,830
understand but but my argument is if

1254
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,510
we're gonna do a princess movie like

1255
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,430
it's about the princesses I don't think

1256
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,100
we need the princes to be honest that's

1257
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,960
the story I want to see I want to see

1258
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,690
more with Tiana I want to see more with

1259
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,240
Belle I want to see them bonding I want

1260
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,010
to see them having action-packed

1261
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,890
adventures you're gonna that are not

1262
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:30,340
tied to at the end of the day we have to

1263
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:39,820
bring the men back the big part it's

1264
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,800
like maybe that the end goal they like

1265
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,510
the final moment is there but it's not

1266
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,960
like there's you're saying the end goal

1267
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,270
and final moment in your pitch is the

1268
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,490
they rescue the men no I don't know they

1269
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:52,810
rescue the men my say they rescue the

1270
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:58,560
people they love that's not that's not

1271
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,540
their way down to a very generalization

1272
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,119
of both of our ideas really it's about

1273
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:05,470
the inner life of both of ours we're

1274
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,000
gone we're talking about the journey and

1275
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,260
the interaction and the things they

1276
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,000
learn from each other and go again

1277
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,770
well you're bringing it right back to

1278
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,369
them good I feel like Clark made a great

1279
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,730
point we've we've also we've rebutted it

1280
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,040
a bit let's move on to we're going in a

1281
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,250
circle now okay well the reason that I

1282
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,680
want to do a pirate princess team up

1283
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,310
movie is because so

1284
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,590
with both Beauty and the Beast and with

1285
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,060
Princess and the Frog a lot of people

1286
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,520
argue that come the second act both of

1287
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,070
those leads kind of get sidelined right

1288
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:41,960
tiana turns into a frog and and and and

1289
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,000
Belle essentially the movie becomes

1290
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,410
about the Beast and her rehabilitation

1291
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:47,720
of the beast but I think at the end of

1292
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,360
the day these two characters are some of

1293
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,370
the most fascinating and interesting and

1294
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,140
compelling characters that the Disney

1295
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,470
Princess like stable has put out and so

1296
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,410
by teaming them up together and having

1297
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,240
them sort of leave out or leave out of

1298
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,000
the Port of New Orleans and set sail for

1299
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,120
the high seas you get to see and you get

1300
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,350
to see something I've never seen before

1301
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,990
which is honestly like a badass pirate

1302
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,060
movie that has ladies in it that has

1303
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,000
ladies up at the central focus and you

1304
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,980
get to see a completely like unique

1305
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,190
adventure for these two princesses see I

1306
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,870
think I think that there's something

1307
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,280
there's something about that that's

1308
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,390
interesting but it's just the two

1309
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,740
princesses you have I want to see later

1310
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,460
yes a cameo she's Mike Myers and but I

1311
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,020
want to see the Avengers with these

1312
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,970
princesses if the record Ralph scene did

1313
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,620
for me was like I want to see all these

1314
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,930
women get together and do something and

1315
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,760
kick some ass because they're saving

1316
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,110
their men it's not a message where they

1317
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,580
need their men to define them that's

1318
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,380
like saying well you know in Star Wars

1319
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,300
they say Princess Leia is that what does

1320
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,440
their end goal they're just saving a

1321
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,270
girl if you flipped if you flip those

1322
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,190
genders in that it's if the argument is

1323
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,030
just I think very it minimizes like you

1324
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,770
said all of the villains we know who are

1325
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,930
the villains that you're Zola the Queen

1326
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:11,630
from Snow White all of them from yeah I

1327
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,790
mean I mean from my idea what I wanted

1328
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,440
was like you start off with the four who

1329
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,600
are known to be like self-reliant or not

1330
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,250
known to be self-reliant like the ones

1331
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,020
who clearly are all about their prints

1332
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,610
and then when they go on their journey

1333
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,530
they have the team-up with the tougher

1334
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,970
ones like Mulan Merida from brave and

1335
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,110
and when they do that it's like they

1336
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,460
learn from each other that this though

1337
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,440
once we're not so self-reliant learned

1338
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,060
to be tougher and the ones who are

1339
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,760
tougher learned to be a little bit more

1340
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,780
sensitive and I feel like you can have a

1341
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,610
lot of fun quipping back and forth and

1342
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,410
then they go on their journey like my

1343
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,270
idea is the Infinity Gauntlet that was

1344
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,370
the Maleficent took is put under the sea

1345
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,770
that's being guarded by Ursula so they

1346
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,690
have to like get mallanna's help to go

1347
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,840
to to the CRL is like still a human it

1348
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,190
got kind of what Clark actually had I

1349
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,270
have it written down here too it's like

1350
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,130
are you know still a human and then the

1351
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,930
end she does come in and like helps the

1352
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,070
whatever the kingdom is where the

1353
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,720
mermaids are and then you have like a

1354
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,760
big epic battle between all of them like

1355
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,530
all the deal like the Disney villains

1356
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,990
and they're all shit your final thoughts

1357
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:12,490
sure I basically think that with this

1358
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:13,750
idea it's like so if they're not by a

1359
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,220
couple things I base I think that this

1360
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,860
story idea that I have lint lends itself

1361
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,500
to a structure that is easy to see where

1362
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,990
you can actually have a lot of fun

1363
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,890
interaction with all the Disney

1364
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,110
Princesses you know it's like these

1365
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,700
characters will learn from each other

1366
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,080
it's really about their arcs where the

1367
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,940
sensitive woman learn to be you know

1368
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,320
more tough and self-reliant where the

1369
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,820
tough ones learn to be you know a little

1370
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,850
bit more sensitive so it's not attacking

1371
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,950
the Disney characters but showing that

1372
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,290
all the qualities of self-reliance plus

1373
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,210
vulnerability coexisted already within

1374
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,890
all of them one thing I liked about that

1375
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,660
Ralph breaks the internet cameos I did a

1376
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,330
great job at poking fun at a lot of the

1377
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,830
Disney Princess tropes that I've been

1378
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,630
criticized but they didn't insult the

1379
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,370
property and I want to carry that theme

1380
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,980
forward and I also think what there are

1381
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,480
us would be fun to have a cool musical

1382
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,120
number and and I think that with Clark's

1383
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,800
idea I think there's some interesting

1384
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,360
elements there I don't really see a full

1385
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,700
movie laid out though it's more of just

1386
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,970
an idea and I also think that you know

1387
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,730
parts of the like rebooting pirates I'm

1388
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,170
sick of pirates why would we want to

1389
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,870
just reboot that right now and for

1390
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,300
Mark's idea it's like yeah I know we

1391
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,980
have a lot of similarities I feel like

1392
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,720
yours is a little too dark for my taste

1393
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,500
for Disney Princesses teaming up alright

1394
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,040
yeah

1395
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,170
no he has Thanos his glove kill half of

1396
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,780
the Disney animated character so sorry

1397
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,160
mine mine too

1398
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,040
I think I think for mine I want to see a

1399
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,110
superteam movie of all these cool

1400
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,730
princesses because I think we're Clark

1401
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,260
and I agree but we don't realize we

1402
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,550
agree is I think the princess that

1403
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,890
princes are generally bland guys no one

1404
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,510
remembers the prick that's what was so

1405
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,540
great about Kenneth Branagh

1406
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,690
Cinderella I understand why she loves

1407
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,390
this character I think on paper you you

1408
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,460
run a slippery slope of maybe making it

1409
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,050
the trope of rescuing people but I think

1410
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,090
these women getting together and proving

1411
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,070
to themselves that they don't need the

1412
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,590
men and they're viable potent characters

1413
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,330
and rescue they're rescuing people they

1414
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,700
love they're not rescuing men as agender

1415
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,590
I think that is a noble thing that is

1416
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,990
the goes to all the hero's quest and I

1417
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,730
think it ties in all these great

1418
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,860
characters and we've seen the success of

1419
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,110
the DC superhero girls the kids where

1420
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,790
where the Disney Princesses are pretty

1421
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,470
dolls and you have the you have these DC

1422
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,610
superhero girls that are like kick-ass

1423
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,230
superheroes and high school and stuff

1424
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,520
you can do that with the Disney

1425
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,290
Princesses make them not make them more

1426
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,440
Megan Merkel as a princess then Kate

1427
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,490
Middleton as a princess make them

1428
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,200
someone who's a person who's good who's

1429
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,570
got a personality and defined and I

1430
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:36,680
think it would be a lot of fun to see

1431
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,060
all of these characters will be the best

1432
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,160
kind of nostalgia thanks mark

1433
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,500
Clark okay so at the end of the day for

1434
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,030
me the problem with these other two

1435
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,700
pitches is that however you define it

1436
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,650
they're tethered to the women's

1437
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,260
relationships to the men and I don't

1438
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,330
think we need that frankly like I think

1439
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,010
these characters are interesting enough

1440
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,470
to stand on their own and again I chose

1441
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:00,260
to to focus on two because I think that

1442
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,570
if we because I actually want to see a

1443
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,730
movie with folk that focuses really

1444
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,390
focuses on these two characters I also

1445
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,340
think that it's time to swing big I

1446
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,670
don't want it to be this this you know

1447
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:16,430
cool role reversal that we see in

1448
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,590
Hollywood all the time like like oh you

1449
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,300
know that trope well we're flipping it

1450
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,740
it's like yeah but we've seen that

1451
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,100
before

1452
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,600
what we haven't seen before is is in

1453
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,220
swashbuckling action-adventure starring

1454
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,160
two women who are learning about each

1455
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,230
other and who are setting out on their

1456
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,740
own adventure for themselves so that's

1457
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,690
why I want to see that movie awesome

1458
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,430
Thank You Clark ring-a-ding-ding that is

1459
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,730
around three long I we handled the

1460
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,920
Chernabog thing so I don't really

1461
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,570
it affected a lot of people in the

1462
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,070
comments were pointing out cutthroat

1463
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,190
island as a female-driven

1464
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,750
I think you also have Matthew Modine I

1465
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,190
think Clark's point still stands so I

1466
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,570
would not offer that as well so

1467
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,480
cutthroat island is a notorious horrible

1468
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,970
movie so I I don't I'm not gonna include

1469
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,610
Renny Harlin must be so distraught right

1470
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:10,250
now come on Chyna so cool yeah

1471
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,430
cutthroat island Geena Davis Geena Davis

1472
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,620
is great oh no I'd like you guys to know

1473
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,900
enough love out there so uh yeah this is

1474
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,620
a fun round yeah uh maybe the most

1475
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,480
interesting thing to me was stealing the

1476
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,530
Infinity Gauntlet

1477
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:28,160
but that um I like that a lot

1478
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,470
he's talking about me first guys yeah I

1479
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,960
felt like these like super team team ups

1480
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,790
like it's stole a little bit of the

1481
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,800
individuality of the characters and the

1482
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,630
princesses and I like how Clark just

1483
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:44,540
like really have like made distinct

1484
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,380
choices for a reason and and I like I

1485
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,300
feel like it's important to make it

1486
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,340
their own story and I thought Clark

1487
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,530
really hit that not that you guys like

1488
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,960
you know we're saying they need the men

1489
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,300
but you know the role reversal but she

1490
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,940
had that nicely in her final thoughts as

1491
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,790
well that that is such a common trope to

1492
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,800
take you know someone who doesn't

1493
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,020
usually do the thing and flip it in this

1494
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,990
version of the story so for several

1495
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,670
reasons yeah Clark just uh her answer

1496
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,620
really started to resonate with me and

1497
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,020
by the end I wanted to see that Belle

1498
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,930
and tiana team up the most Clark gets my

1499
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:27,560
point along well I really made Greg I'm

1500
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,680
gonna talk about you first again I was

1501
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,480
crazy about the idea of bringing sort of

1502
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,950
the fan OHS Marvel stuff it just feels

1503
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,510
like this is finally the Disney

1504
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,370
Princesses chance of sighing why are we

1505
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,260
bringing in so much Marvel stuff so I

1506
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,030
kind of thought Clark got yeah on that

1507
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,190
one and it's splitting our focus so it

1508
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,930
came down to mark versus Clark for me I

1509
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:47,150
will say with Clark's pitch I like the

1510
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,010
pirate idea I just I wanted to hear more

1511
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,710
of the pitch itself what's the conflict

1512
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,300
what's their goal like what are they

1513
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,830
going like this is their own adventure

1514
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,600
but because I do feel like most movies

1515
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,280
like that there would be a love interest

1516
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:58,779
there

1517
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,489
be some part of the goal that would be

1518
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:02,559
involved with either men or women if

1519
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,469
that was their interest so I that felt

1520
00:58:05,469 --> 00:58:07,059
that's not weird it just felt like she

1521
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:08,679
wasn't giving us necessarily the

1522
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:11,079
conclusion to avoid that so ultimately I

1523
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:13,239
felt like I was gonna go with mark all

1524
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,339
right so it's 1:1 mark and Clark

1525
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:19,109
Danielle what does the poll have to say

1526
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:24,400
um with 41 percent it is mark Greg has

1527
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,489
33 percent and then Clark's idea with 25

1528
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:31,359
percent one tweet I really wanted to

1529
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,979
point out that I liked it's from one of

1530
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:34,509
our regulars hey dude I'm gonna do the

1531
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:35,979
thing I do where I make it so your name

1532
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:36,969
isn't the cuss word you're trying to

1533
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:44,469
make me say get underscore shit Eve says

1534
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:47,949
milada and Ariel the ocean masters which

1535
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,509
I think it'd be interesting and then he

1536
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:54,819
invites Aquaman a second well mallanna

1537
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:56,979
is already a navigator so that is an

1538
00:58:56,979 --> 00:58:58,539
interesting point she wouldn't wouldn't

1539
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,479
she be one of the pirates y'all ready

1540
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,709
dangerous to see one of them the best

1541
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:05,319
friends with the hurricane wash up on

1542

1544
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:14,499
came down to the tiebreak and Mark just

1545
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:15,999

1546

1548
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,799

1549
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:25,509

next time around because it's always

1553
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,349
great to have you I gotta say it's

1554
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:36,819
always hard to compete against Clark

1555
00:59:36,819 --> 00:59:38,979
because we are on the same team in the

1556
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:41,819
Schmo down and she's so smart and so

1557
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:44,919
biting and specific and great that it's

1558
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:46,630
always a pleasure isn't pietatis oh ya

1559
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,079
know she put my mind to like a whole new

1560
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,089
way of looking at Princess Leia today so

1561
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,609
for that and for just you always coming

1562
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:56,019
in and bringing it and after that spec

1563
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:58,479
Texas Chainsaw Massacre script awesome

1564
00:59:58,479 --> 01:00:01,449
but this here is a great moment in

1565
01:00:01,449 --> 01:00:03,429
sports because this speed round will

1566
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:06,699
decide who will face Dan Moreau for the

1567
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:10,000
title belt all right

1568
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,030
um so this is how the speed round works

1569
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,369
we'll throw out the question shout out

1570
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:16,930
your answers the first person to answer

1571
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,790
will get a chance to elaborate on their

1572
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,040
answer first it will give me 20 seconds

1573
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,960
20 seconds and then 10 second rebuttal

1574
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,750
10 second rebuttal fellas y'all ready

1575
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,330
for this yes sir all right first

1576
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,190
question of the speed round

1577
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:32,710
okay keepin it keepin it dis keepin a

1578
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,560
Disney the first travel for The Lion

1579
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,680
King dropped on Thanksgiving is it fair

1580
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,230
to call the new Lion King movie live

1581
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:47,890
home damn it okay mark says no and Greg

1582
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:52,000
says damn it okay so mark will argue for

1583
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,050
no Greg will argue for yes and mark 20

1584
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:57,640
seconds begin whenever you speak there

1585
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,770
is no live action in that movie it is

1586
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:02,650
all computer-generated it is animated it

1587
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,450
is animated there's no argument there

1588
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,099
this question I don't even have to argue

1589
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:07,359
because there's no live action and it

1590
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,270
it's all CG I don't know why we call

1591
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,880
realistic animation live action it's it

1592
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,220
makes zero sense it's derivative it's

1593
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,349
it's insulting to all the animators that

1594
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:19,119
made all that stuff look real insulting

1595
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,349
to animators Greg while it's heavy on

1596
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:25,660
CGI there's still plenty of sets that

1597
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,190
are being built there's still a lot of

1598
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,080
crew members that all involve bringing

1599
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,540
it to life so yes it is CGI but that's

1600
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,830
also like saying those sequences in

1601
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,869
Avatar are not live-action and only

1602
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:36,880
animated just because there's a lot of

1603
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,920
CGI doesn't mean it's strictly animated

1604
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,390
the fact that there's so many people on

1605
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,339
set that is mocap involved these are

1606
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:44,380
real people bringing this to life ok

1607
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,180
avatar by the Academy rules would

1608
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,950
qualify as an animated movie and mocap

1609
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,960
has existed Peter Pan all the flying was

1610
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,580
done with rotoscoped is that not an

1611
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,050
animated movie because they used that

1612
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,359
it's a it's an invalid argument to

1613
01:01:55,359 --> 01:02:00,720
animate a moving

1614
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,820
I don't know about Avatar being

1615
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,170
qualified as an animated movie but the

1616
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,900
fact that Disney itself is calling it a

1617
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,250
live-action movie qualifies it to be a

1618
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,050
live-action movie the fact that you have

1619
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,390
directors actors onset people building

1620
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,560
sets it's live-action movie all right

1621
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,430
Daniel Radford I just really want to say

1622
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:27,930
great job Greg and arguing something but

1623
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,540
a very and a great argument on

1624
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,790
considering how vehemently disagree but

1625
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,160
yeah I got it yeah mark came with the

1626
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,349
facts he came with yes it is insulting

1627
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:39,150
to animators yes there has been a

1628
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,010
history of using rotoscope like in the

1629
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,109
beginning of Jem I don't know why I know

1630
01:02:43,109 --> 01:02:46,740
that and the mocap has existed and the

1631
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,150
thing about the academy rules is what

1632
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,400
put it over for me okay that's one for

1633

showmen lame is Rob and more what movie

1640
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,800
star would have the worst touring live

1641
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:18,359
stage show Russell Crowe does it have to

1642
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:21,869
be someone alive now I'd say no yeah I

1643
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:26,220
don't think so yeah the worst touring a

1644
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,410
live show words were story why is this

1645
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,940
singing life or just like alright

1646
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:36,780
whatever you want Charlie Sheen alright

1647
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,680
Charlie Sheen we heard Russell Crowe

1648
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,690
first 20 seconds again when you speak

1649
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,330
Greg lame is is a classic musical play

1650
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:48,020
that requires you to be a fantastic

1651
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,730
singer and then the movie is delivered

1652
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,040
on fantastic singing and the biggest

1653
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,690
thing I heard before I ever saw that

1654
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,630
movie was how horrible Russell Crowe is

1655
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,490
in that movie every time he was on

1656
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:02,099
screen and seen it ruined the film it

1657
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,390
takes you out of it so for him to

1658
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,240
revisit and tour that since this wasn't

1659
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,700
specified as a singing tour Charlie

1660
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,859
Sheen actually did this once and no one

1661
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:12,410
cared he is a drug

1662
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,960
misogynist who's dying I don't want to

1663
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,420
pay $80 and spend two hours watching him

1664
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,799
tell stories about his drug addiction

1665
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:21,809
and all the porn stars he's had sex with

1666
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:23,670
that sounds like the most depressing

1667
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,410
thing in the world and these Russell

1668
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:29,039
Crowe is an oscar-winning actor what was

1669
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:29,760
the question again

1670
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,089
okay the question is what movie star

1671
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:35,430
would have the worst touring live stage

1672
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:49,230
show people love watching Charlie Sheen

1673
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:51,569
go crazy and do stupid things in front

1674
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:53,029
of the public he was he that's

1675
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:55,109
catapulted his career to something even

1676
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:57,180
bigger Russell Crowe if he was to do

1677
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,680
some type of live performances singing

1678
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,960
again just be awful Charlie Sheen is

1679
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,309
considered a joke by everyone that

1680
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:04,049
actually matters Russell Crowe is an

1681
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:05,819
Academy Award winning actor who gave one

1682
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,260
of his best performances recently and

1683
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,609
has interesting stories to tell if you

1684
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:10,049
see him on talk shows and he tells

1685
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:14,450
stories I've listened to him time wow

1686
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:19,589
I'm slightly confused by the question is

1687
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:22,109
it is it Tiger blood or is it Tigers in

1688
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:24,150
the gladiator arena that didn't work out

1689
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:30,359
okay the way they're long tough one I

1690
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:35,279
feel like I feel like I feel great did a

1691
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:37,890
good job of convincing me why I wouldn't

1692
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,869
want to go see Russell Crowe sing but

1693
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,359
the question was just live stage show so

1694
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,339
I think on that level mark Turkey all

1695
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:46,109
right that's one for Mark Daniel Radford

1696
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,000
I have to agree with everything that lon

1697
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,740
just said we are not stepping on this

1698
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,170
one yep and I would have been clean

1699
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,299
sweep on that yeah mark and Draco's

1700
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:56,670
vaulted into the lead 3 to 2 on the

1701
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:02,480
shoulders of Sheen hashtag winning yeah

1702
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,500
ok question number three this is game

1703
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,869
point for mark by the way right you need

1704
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:12,599
this to keep her going thanks how sure

1705
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:16,890
thing in their online store a 24 is

1706
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,589
selling scented candles inspired by

1707
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:22,440
movies on Rah's which movies candle in

1708
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,750
any movie which movies

1709
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:28,050
candle would smell the best the Cheech

1710
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:35,850
and Chong series which movies candle

1711
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:45,870
yeah agent truckers they're all odd the

1712
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,820
Corsican brothers don't pick the

1713
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:52,470
Corsican born in East LA okay that's all

1714
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,700
right I think of it yeah we've amped

1715
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,470
enough for a branch give us an give us a

1716
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,840
candle way off make it a candle just

1717
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,120
think of a movie movie candle oh I think

1718
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,640
like a candle from an actual movie

1719
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,200
smelling hands yeah this movie man it

1720
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,140
like became if they made a candle based

1721
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:21,630
on 10th of a woman you know I would like

1722
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,400
to enjoy a lovely evening with both of

1723
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,640
those cat makes the other great yes all

1724
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,650
right and both make a wonderful

1725
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,030
combination alright so we heard mark

1726
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,570
first Cheech and Chong up and swung I

1727
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,430
think it's I think it's funny because of

1728
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,200
the marijuana Association but now as

1729
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,090
marijuana and cannabis and CBD have

1730
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,710
become more accepted culturally are used

1731
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,630
as medicine and the smell of that when

1732
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,130
you walk past someone smelling some good

1733
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,450
smoke and some good herb that's a good

1734
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,670
relaxing smell and I think it ties into

1735
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,620
their brand the brand of what Cheech and

1736
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:56,760
Chong are alright mark keep it up 420

1737
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,120
friendly Greg I know so many people who

1738
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,670
hate marijuana and hate the smell of we

1739
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:05,640
you have to have a very specific taste

1740
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,660
or something like that

1741
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,950
we're Scent of a Woman when I think

1742
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,080
about that movie it is constantly about

1743
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,090
scent and pointing out beautiful

1744
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:13,890
smelling things so I feel like if they

1745
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,080
were to do candles based off of the

1746
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,060
beautiful things out Pacino is smelling

1747
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,620
throughout that movie the beautiful

1748
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,970
perfumes even get candles

1749
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:23,190
there are so many different smells to

1750
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:24,480
the different sense the different

1751
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,220
strains of marijuana some of them are

1752
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,750
actually quite floral and fly fragrance

1753
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,130
so writing them off as the bud we used

1754
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,060
to smoke in high school is it

1755
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,770
diminishing instead of a woman that

1756
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:35,190
title alone

1757
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,330
title alone woman who smelled great

1758
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,190
smell great it's a lovely scent what I

1759
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,870
think we both smoked marijuana

1760
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,549
apparently and I think that all

1761
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:44,230
marijuana smells exactly the same I

1762
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,609
every time I go buy some it's like the

1763
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:48,069
exact same thing right I'll talk to you

1764
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:48,850
after the show

1765
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:54,069
all right time the most ridiculous

1766
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:59,230
question ever asked thank you that's the

1767
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:03,190
point yeah I felt like Greg had a good

1768
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:05,049
ding on mark saying yeah most of

1769
01:09:05,049 --> 01:09:07,720
marijuana smells pretty similar whereas

1770
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,930
any painted the picture of just not you

1771
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:14,620
know of Pacino finding different scents

1772
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,990
and essences so for that I'm gonna go

1773
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,660
with Greg lon

1774
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,490
yeah when he first said it I thought we

1775
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,920
were going down a real questionable Road

1776
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,230
but Greg totally brought me back around

1777
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:28,180
with the you know it is a scent themed

1778

movie so I'm going threat there we go

1779
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:40,240

1780
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:47,650
oh yeah you know I wish I could give

1781
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,170
Clark the point okay here we go it is

1782
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,600
all tied up at 3:00 3:00 this my friends

1783
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,000
is game point yet again a great moment

1784
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,030
in sports if they remake back to the

1785
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:07,420
future who should play the new Doc Brown

1786
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:16,290
Michael J Fox

1787
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:20,820
richard jenkins we have Richard Jenkins

1788
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,940
we have Michael J Fox mark twenty

1789
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,710
seconds on the clock one sister since

1790
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:26,850
this is never gonna happen because the

1791
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,470
mecca said oh won't Michael J Fox would

1792
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,450
be playing the Doc Brown type he would

1793
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,220
be taking over the role like charlie

1794
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,900
takes over the Chocolate Factory which

1795
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,370
would give this franchise instant

1796
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:36,810
validity and the fans like me who think

1797
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:38,610
this is a perfect movie and should never

1798
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,100
be remade but if you did having Marty

1799
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,630
have all the knowledge of Doc and having

1800
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:44,520
to be the mentor would be a lovely

1801
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,900
lovely evolution of him and a great

1802
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,970
salute to Michael J Fox will it me the

1803
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,100
question more time please yes if they

1804
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,320
remake Back to the Future who should

1805
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:58,380
play the new Doc Brown you didn't treat

1806
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,700
yours like a remake you traitor like

1807
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,930
your own little sequel movie that you

1808
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,430
want to do and I have members watching

1809
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,890
Michael J Fox do that Jimmy Kimmel thing

1810
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,420
and it was not easy to watch like the

1811
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,580
both of them are just can't really do it

1812
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,230
Richard Jenkins though I remember saying

1813
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,520
him in shape of water he's good at

1814
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,440
playing like neurotic older guys he

1815
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,460
could bring some it's a little bit more

1816
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,380
subtle really believable to talk Brown I

1817
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,240
want to remake this with Richard Jenkins

1818
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,490
as he can be the whole neurotic guy this

1819
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,050
is such a beloved franchise that you

1820
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,610
have to have an acknowledgement of it

1821
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,260
and this isn't a reboot this isn't just

1822
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,150
a this is a reboot conceptually but it's

1823
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,950
also a through-line of continuation and

1824
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,450
I think that's the only way to if you're

1825
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:34,290
anything a consider doing this you

1826
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,880
clearly don't want your movie to be made

1827
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,680
I want my movie to be made Richard

1828
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,360
Jenkins is that older actor who can

1829
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,740
bring so much subtlety to I think

1830
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,780
Michael J Fox taking over this without

1831
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,740
having this Christopher Lloyd

1832
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,120
counterpart is just a distraction in

1833
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,310
missing element time alright Danielle

1834
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:51,630
sorry I take notes while you guys

1835
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,970
arguing so I can make it fair

1836
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,490
yeah both of these are great arguments

1837
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,680
it really does come down to the question

1838
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,760
of whether it's to take over as actual

1839
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,950
Doc Brown or take over to dr. Doc Brown

1840
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:09,870
type I am I didn't see there being a

1841
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,780
problem with it being a doctor on type

1842
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,850
and therefore I I do have to say that I

1843
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:18,330
like marks pitch better alright so that

1844
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:24,019
is one for mark with Michael J Fox

1845
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:31,039
yeah I man I I thought Mark had a good

1846
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:35,090
pitch and I really liked it just like

1847
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:38,690
being in omage and a connection that the

1848
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:42,170
fans would accept but then yeah

1849
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,999
Greg brought up that jimmy kimmel

1850
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:45,860
parents unlike that was at the 25th

1851
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,480
anniversary of Back to the Future and

1852
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,699
it's yeah it was it did feel a little

1853
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,320
ham-fisted it didn't it wasn't

1854
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,840
satisfying was kind of like oh okay

1855
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,650
great and I do love Richard Jenkins

1856
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,329
who's great in shape of water love that

1857
01:12:59,329 --> 01:13:02,480
guy since uh six feet under and I need

1858
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,699
and the visitor and so many great movies

1859
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:07,489
so yeah I'm going with Greg so lon

1860
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:09,230
comes down to you my friend both

1861
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,449
interesting takes when when Mark first

1862
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:13,969
said Michael J Fox I wasn't quite sure I

1863
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:16,130
saw it but I did like sort of how we

1864
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,630
talked through it and and what the

1865
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:20,360
actual pitch was but ultimately I think

1866
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,980
if you're gonna reboot back to the

1867
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,719
future just got a clean slate it trying

1868
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:25,099
to do something totally different with

1869
01:13:25,099 --> 01:13:27,110
it and I thought Richard Jenkins is a

1870
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:30,650
really interesting outside the box way

1871
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,239
to go with it so I'm going with Greg as

1872
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:39,409
well Greg you take the day GTE and Joe

1873

01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,170
well Gregg you will fan and for what

1875
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,280
it's worth I completely agree remarked

1876
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:56,720
on that best bet not to make it but yeah
