102
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,130
majority deems that tweet funny that

103
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,660
person will be revealed and they will

104
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,390

105
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,310

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,889
boys bet that shirt should get off

110
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:01,610
I don't think you're getting your job

111
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,680

113
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,270
to Urban Outfitters once okay one just

114
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,680
to prepare you guys I think these tweets

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,999
might be less funny than what we just

116
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,050
did so let's see this first tweet I'm so

117
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,810
lazy that I'll type I before I had fixed

118
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,289
this I both is this funny

119
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,169
oh I remember that's when the typo thing

120
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,849
happened the autocorrect when it would

121
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,829
turn it to like a semicolon so this is

122
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,250
like an old tweet so funny or not funny

123
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,740
let's see then thumbs three two what

124
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:51,579

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,390
any sweat I suppose be a secret that's a

242
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,980
secret the middle one there's no secrets

243

argue with your logic I mean you like

246
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,810
Moneyball my photos all right good

247
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,000
you'll be guessing from Shane's account

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,350
so your caption is hey winky face no

249
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,090
that could be anything

250
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,180
Oh Jessie wait let's see the first photo

251
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,930
oh hey look you're winking and she's

252
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:49,410
looking Supes cute

253
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,729
oh my god you can apply to all three of

254
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:57,229
them so they all three are saying hey oh

255
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:00,569
they're just so swab but only one of

256
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:04,319
them is winking now is it literally

257
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,689
winking or is that trying to throw me

258
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:10,199
off the scent of the trail I'll tell you

259
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,730
the second one in the middle

260
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,699
feels like he's like weaking at me with

261
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,339
his just his face that's the key to

262
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,559
headshots

263
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,970
yeah the old face wing I need an

264
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,429
emoticon you know I don't think Shane's

265
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:32,490
that smart I think that Shane made a

266
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,120
literal caption for his literal winky

267
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,110
face photo we've been spinning on Shane

268
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,320
all games so why is that the key punched

269
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,269

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,970
other smoothing options okay is it the

273
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,400
first photo

274
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
what what sucks is I think the caption

275
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,720
for one of the others was also hey but

276
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,460
what with the winky face that's the end

277
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,210
of the game

278
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,920
