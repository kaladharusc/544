00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,240
you know where to go in their circle

84
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,560
the south of france is it

85
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
pretty amazing place

86
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,350
but

87
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,169

88
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,350

92
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,630
that's the first one you keep these in stock just for me just for you

93
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:10,330

nice and crispy one and some crispy thank you sir

95
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:25,540
okay see this thing happens anytime you have like a special experience in life

96
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,340
and in the moment it feels great it feels wonderful it feels on and i'm

97
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,020
talking about a birthday

98
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,920
our first date like a trip especially travel especially ice is now because I'm

99
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,960
like exhausted right now with it and i look back i think about yesterday i

100
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,990
think about this amazing trip that I took with my kid

101
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,530
it just feels like this fun thing that i did as time goes by

102
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,760
they go from being these like little fun things to something so much more

103
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,220
substantial time has this magical ability to erase all the negative and

104
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,690
amplify all the positive like as I'm talking to the camera right now I'm

105
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,830
looking into the screen and I see this picture over my shoulder

106
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,900
that's me that's Candace that was like two thousand eight

107
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,330
when can I went on this trip went to my friend's wedding in Vegas and we had

108
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,510
just broken up and gotten back together and we have this like amazing time

109
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,090
together in vegas and in the moment you know Brad look back at it now and I

110
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,620
realized that that was such a big moment for us in our relationship and forever

111
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,910
will look that can have that I'm launching into this tirade right now

112
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,040
because I feel like a fun and the whole france and the Mercedes and like it was

113
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,900
also the moment that my kid went from being a kid to being like but no matter

114
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,890
what no matter what happens in the rest of our lives we will always have the

115
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,870
experiences we had together

116
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,529
it is those moments in a

117
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,529
forget that equal life

118
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,250
me hey girl are you listening yeah at first I didn't and then I did when you

119
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,060
first leave them like no one's gonna wake me up at four in the morning and I

120
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,800

121
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
once Casey coming home

122
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,130
