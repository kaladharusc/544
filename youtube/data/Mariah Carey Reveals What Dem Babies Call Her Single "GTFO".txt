1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,168
-It's so good to see you!
We love you!

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,302
-Look at this.
-Come on!

3
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:04,504
-I haven't been in New York
in so long.

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,206
It feels so good.
-Oh, that's right.

5
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,807
It feels good to be in New York.
-Yes, it does.

6
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,576
-Always so happy
to have you here.

7
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,844
Come on.
Mariah Carey, come on!

8
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:14,080
[ Cheers and applause ]

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,214
-Thank you.
-How are you?

10
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,784
-I'm good, I'm good.
-How are the babies?

11
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,318
-Everybody's good.
-Everybody's happy.

12
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:20,787
-Them kids, yeah.

13
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,523
-I want to have you here
every holiday season.

14
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,225
Can you just make it a thing?

15
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,826
-I brought the snow!
-You did!

16
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,228
You brought the snow with you.
[ Laughter ]

17
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,631
I mean, I want you --
Every year, you should come.

18
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,932
Every holiday season, just come,

19
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,402
because &quot;All I Want
for Christmas is You&quot; is --

20
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,037
I mean, that is the most --

21
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,607
[ Cheers and applause ]

22
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,807
-It's festive.
-I mean, I want to talk about --

23
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:43,076
I want to talk about
the new album.

24
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,511
I want to talk about --
-But I'm with you.

25
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,180
It's like we're getting close
to the holidays and it's...

26
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,281
-It's the most downloaded song

27
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,849
in the history
of holiday music, ever.

28
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,918
You hit it out of the park.

29
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,453
-That's exciting.
-Yes!

30
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,888
But, I mean, you are --

31
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,390
I would say you're the Queen
of Christmas music right now.

32
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,893
-Thank you.
-I want to know --

33
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,528
When is it okay
to start listening

34
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:05,131
to Christmas music,
holiday music?

35
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,500
-I have this rule where I try
to get through Thanksgiving.

36
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,601
I don't like
when people rush it,

37
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,503
because once I start,
I don't stop.

38
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,038
-I know, me neither!

39
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,073
-Until after, like,
almost New Year's.

40
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,174
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:17,477
-You put here --
you on October 31st.

42
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,511
-Yes.

43
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,179
-And then this is you
on November 1st.

44
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,281
-Yes.
[ Laughter ]

45
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,515
-You just --
You couldn't help it,

46
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,084
and you just started listening?
-I can't help it.

47
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,086
When I first wrote &quot;All I Want
for Christmas is You,&quot;

48
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,021
I was like, you know,
&quot;I'll give it a shot

49
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:31,024
and see what happens.&quot;
-How did it come about?

50
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,192
Were you just like --
-Well, the label was like,

51
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,427
&quot;You should do
a Christmas album.&quot;

52
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,661
I was like, &quot;Really?

53
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,096
It seems kind of early
in my life to do that.&quot;

54
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,364
And then I was like,
&quot;Okay, I'll just --

55
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,498
I love Christmas.

56
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,434
I'll just sit down
and try and work it out.&quot;

57
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,570
-Did you write --
Was the first lyrics, like,

58
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,870
&quot;I don't want
a lot for Christmas&quot;?

59
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,639
-Yes, they were.
[ Light laughter ]

60
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,874
Yes, they were.
And I actually played

61
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,177
a lot of that myself,
and I'm a terrible piano player.

62
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,211
I wrote another Christmas song

63
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,546
with our friend James
over here...

64
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,580
-Oh, yeah, James!
[ Cheers and applause ]

65
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,615
-...called
&quot;When Christmas Comes,&quot;

66
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,883
for my second Christmas album.

67
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,351
I would just say &quot;hey&quot; to him.

68
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,853
And I like to work with people
that are as talented as he is

69
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,221
on the piano...
-Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,057
-...because I'm -- I would
never play in front of him.

71
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,391
But anyway...
[ Laughter ]

72
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,859
-So you're just noodling around,
and you go, like...

73
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,862
-Yeah. But it was really about
the feeling of the song.

74
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,531
You know what I mean?
That's why that song has

75
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,134
kind of like a different type
of a chord progression,

76
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,301
because I don't know
what I'm doing.

77
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,069
-It gets you in the mood.
It is the greatest.

78
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,537
I love it.
-Thank you.

79
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:19,873
-I want to ask,
while you're here, too.

80
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,175
I know you're an advisor
on &quot;The Voice,&quot;

81
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,676
and I know you're
not really allowed to say

82
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,411
who you think
is gonna win or anything --

83
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,380
of course not -- but who do
you think is gonna win?

84
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,948
[ Laughter ]

85
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,417
-I have a favorite,
but I don't want to be biased.

86
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,751
I can't.
-No, you can't say that --

87
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,155
-Kelly's team is great,
but don't sleep on Jennifer.

88
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,256
We love both of them,
and so, yeah.

89
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,825
-You can just whisper.

90
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,026
-I can't, 'cause they're
gonna hear me on the mic.

91
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,495
-I know, I did it on purpose.
[ Laughter ]

92
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,230
Let's talk about &quot;Caution.&quot;
-Yes.

93
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,032
-This is great
that you have this album out.

94
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:51,337
I'm telling you,
the first track, the &quot;GTFO,&quot;

95
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,406
-Yes.
-...already went to number one.

96
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,241
Yeah, &quot;Get the --&quot;
Yeah, exactly.

97
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,575
[ Laughter ]

98
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,511
But, also, you know
what was number one this week?

99
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,012
I -- I don't know
if you've heard this.

100
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,113
-I did hear about it.

101
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,681
-The number one album
on iTunes...

102
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,550
-Mm-hmm.
-Is the &quot;Glitter&quot; soundtrack.

103
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,086
-Which almost ruined my life,
and now?

104
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,256
#JusticeForGlitter.
It's a movement.

105
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,091
-#JusticeForGlitter.
-Yes.

106
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,360
-How did this end up being
the number-one album now?

107
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,161
-Because the Lambily
got behind it --

108
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,596
That's what I call my fans.
-The Lambs?

109
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:21,266
-They named themselves.
And actually #JusticeForGlitter

110
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,669
was directed at me,
'cause I never do songs from --

111
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,840
it's a soundtrack, actually.
-Do you not like the --

112
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,509
Or it just was a bad time?
-It was a tough time,

113
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,211
you know, when it came out,
it was a whole thing.

114
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,946
It was a drama.
I don't want to get into it,

115
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,915
because then I have to --
We have to change the mood --

116
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,016
-No, I don't want
to change the mood!

117
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,117
I want you to be happy about it,

118
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,686
because it's
the number-one album.

119
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,821
-Yeah. So now --
-You have a possibility

120
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,390
of knocking out &quot;Glitter&quot;
with &quot;Caution.&quot;

121
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,858
-Well, first of all,
the fact that &quot;Glitter&quot;

122
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,194
even, like,
came back as a thing --

123
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,862
-I don't know how it --
-It's a thing.

124
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,230
-It's not --
I'm not making it up.

125
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,332
I mean, it's the number-one
album right now.

126
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:57,002
I would love it
if the top two albums this week

127
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,637
were &quot;Caution&quot;
and then &quot;Glitter,&quot;

128
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,239
and you bump &quot;Glitter&quot;
out of the way to be --

129
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,607
That would
just make life worth...

130
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,910
-Because who ever thought
it was gonna get to number one?

131
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,278
And now it's, like,
all these years later,

132
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,745
but it is a good album,
and I just --

133
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,181
The fans made it happen.

134
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,783
I had nothing to do with it.
They just -- It's a movement.

135
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,151
It's bigger than me.
Much bigger than me.

136
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,953
-This is your first album in --
in four years, is it?

137
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,590
-Yes, yes.
-And &quot;GTFO&quot; came out.

138
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,893
Again, as we said,
&quot;Get the...&quot; yeah.

139
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,363
-Or as my -- as them babies
call it, &quot;Get a fun cow.&quot;

140
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:26,132
-Yes, of course.
&quot;Get the fun --&quot;

141
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,367
-No, &quot;Get a fun --&quot;
How 'bout you get a fun cow?

142
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:29,969
I don't know where they
came up with it, but I never --

143
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,603
I tried not to play the song
in front of them,

144
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,306
and then they were like,
&quot;What does 'GTFO' mean?&quot;

145
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,409
And -- &quot;Get a fun cow.&quot;
[ Laughter ]

146
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,979
-Let's take a listen to &quot;GTFO.&quot;
Here we go.

147
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,450
-♪ Might as well down
this Caymus bottle ♪

148
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,253
♪ I ain't the type
to play the martyr ♪

149
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,387
-These are one
of those jams I play

150
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,555
when I'm in the passenger seat.

151
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,023
So I can really --
