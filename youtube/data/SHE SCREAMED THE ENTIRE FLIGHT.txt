review of this this is the rx100 mark 5

34
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,470
in my review of this I said that the

35
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,989
focus was a little slow I was wrong

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,000
Sony got in touch with me and explained

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,090
how to change the settings autofocus

38
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,959
here you

39
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,889
autofocus drive speed right change that

40
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,500
too fast

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,720

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,079
focus fast right right thank you for

43
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,359
letting you know Sony but also why not

44
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,489
have a chip with the autofocus and fast

45
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,900
right cuz I was supposed to figure that

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,480
out all my stuff was a bigger than up

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,859

48
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,549

just love those I go there what you

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,330
I haven't done this in a while but I'm

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,160
going to do a QA the reason why I

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,020
haven't done it is because I really love

53
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,520
to having a sweet intro to the QA

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,400
segment and I haven't shot a new one so

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,920
I'm just going to keep this short then

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,030
I'll shoot a new one and they'll be

57
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,460
awesome again my Q&amp;A format is I just

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,440
sort of tweet and say ask some questions

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,760
people asking questions on Twitter I

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,950
answer them right here

61
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,620
my healthy snack selection first first

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,530
question that says can you put this in

63
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,459
the vlog yes sure no problem consider it

64
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:52,820
done

65
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,580
we need a father-and-son vlog well Owen

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,140
is at college right now on the other

67
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,580
side of the country I know there has

68
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,920
been a father-son video in a long time

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
but that's what happens when the kid

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,550
goes to college do you get sick of

71
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,970
traveling yes I still have to travel but

72
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,410
sometimes I wish that I could stay here

73
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,209
and focus more hi Casey

74
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,780
so do you like living in New York City

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,100
or would you rather move somewhere else

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,160
ah New York City is my favorite place on

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,410
planet earth I absolutely love living in

78
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,750
New York City I do foresee a time when

79
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,550
we move we've talked about in the past

80
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,770
but it's tough to raise children here

81
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,360
but besides that this is like the

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
greatest place ever how's Owen doing

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,020
College is doing great I need to get

84
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,530
like a 3.8 GPA yeah he's in fantastic

85
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,360
what music do you listen to when you run

86
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,160
I like to listen to podcasts you get

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,450
really like focus on what you're

88
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,919
listening to you pay attention you start

89
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,720
to forget about how long you've been

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,330
running and it makes the pain go away

91
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,540
who makes your great pocket - I don't

92
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,680
know I'm not wearing that I'm wearing a

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,990
billy shirt by my wife Candice link

94
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,750
below Canon or Sony um I love them both

95
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,150
cam fantastic I switched to Sony because

96
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,940
all of my vlogs across the board now are

97
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,650
4k even when I shoot on my cell phone

98
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,290
and canons really behind in the 4k

99
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,160
Department do I go to college or nah

100
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,830
that is a very complicated question I

101
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,780
think if you don't know what you want to

102
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,360
do definitely go to college it's a great

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,860
place to figure out what you want to do

104
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,810
what you want to spend the

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,330
of your life doing for a career if you

106
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,470
do know what you want to do and that

107
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,320
doesn't require a degree skip college

108
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,820
take the money you would have spent on

109
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,400
tuition and invest that in experiences

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,290
that promote what it is you want to do

111
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,060
how is Candace feeling about you

112
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,950
vlogging again you know Candace the

113
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,480
family they're not in the vlog as much

114
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
on season three and that's because I'm

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,300
trying really hard to not have this vlog

116
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,580
sort of interrupt my family life or my

117
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,770
personal life there are times with

118
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,570
Candace and me that feel entirely

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,160
appropriate to have her in it and she's

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,810
psyched and I'm psyched like we're in

121
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,850
Miami feels like family time I make a

122
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,919
more concerted effort to keep the camera

123
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,370
away

124
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,229
what point-and-shoot camera do you

125
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,770
recommend I'm a pretty big fan of the

126
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,600
rx100 Mark five where do you get your

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,270
boosted boards from booster board so how

128
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,360
long is the blow that alas this time hey

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,720
Casey I'm those double of in the last

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,090
rocket I am scared mommy that is a good

131
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,770
question because this vlogs not gonna

132
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,870
last forever there will be an end to

133
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,060
this vlog probably in a few months and

134
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,100
then I'll take a bunch of time up and

135
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,539
then I'll probably started up again with

136
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,820
the season for the reason behind that is

137
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,160
the first season I had no idea didn't

138
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,350
think I'd ever end it and that like

139
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,690
really wait on me heavily but thinking

140
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,700
of this series thinking of this show is

141
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,229
something that's cyclical has a

142
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,240
beginning has an end and it starts up

143
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
again it's much easier for me to sort of

144
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,350
wrap my head around it makes me love

145
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,650
this more so this will end I just don't

146
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,780
know what if you blogging would be H oh

147
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,400
well vlogging now is kind of my

148
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,950
part-time job you know I work for the

149
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,810
company that I founded that's now owned

150
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,990

151
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,780
building a media and technology company

152
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,970
vlogging is something I do because I

153
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,090
love I love doing it how do I like my

154
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,800
steak I like my steak like you know

155
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,500
medium rare ish I read somewhere that

156
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,270
our president likes his steak well-done

157
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,139

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,530
in Iceland just grab on for dear life

161
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,260
this city has a way of kicking people's

162
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,560
asses like you cannot imagine my advice

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,270
is make sure if you're moving here

164
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,190
because this is where you want to be

[Music]

190
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,399
that's a stop here for a second this is

191
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,070
a magical spot in a magical time in all

192
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,649
of Manhattan ready okay so it looks like

193
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:11,850
the sun's coming from there

194
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,410
but then the sun's also coming from

195
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,510
there and this isn't Star Wars there

196
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,940
isn't a planet with two suns that's the

197
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,130
actual Sun and then the way they built

198
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,230
this building here it reflects the Sun

199
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,020
but always like ten minutes a day look

200
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,630
how evenly I'm lit this looks like movie

201
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,089
lighting does anybody else care about

202
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,940
this there's just like a filmmaker thing

203
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,980
and now look now just one light of a

204
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,060
dick one light you're light one light

205
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,570
two suns

206
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,220

207
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,260

208
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,580

209
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,250

210
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,570
babies okay where does the baby go I

211
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,399

212
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,170
with getting out of plane right now and

213

Wow cool everything I should take volume

216
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,589
everywhere it's a terrible idea

217
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,550
what are you going to possibly put in

218
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,010
that for 24 hours and California well

219
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,810
you don't have to take this big one you

220
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,459
could just take this well I thought you

221
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,270
didn't take the whole thing

222
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,200
intimidate you sit on it I'm only going

223

224
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,190
underwear you never known you just don't

225
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,540
want to take chances when it comes to

226
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,339
underwear do you think we're going to

227
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,870
make the play

228
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,080
the flights at 8 it's 56 right now

229
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,880
you'll think we're gonna make it if we

230
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
miss the play I just want to make sure

231
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,840
it's because you forgot the bottle not

232
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,030

233
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,620

the future what are you doing no but

243
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,380
we're really late for what should we do

244
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,390
and it's just a baby I'm going through

245
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,630
the quick line with all the bag I think

246
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,589
we're probably okay

247
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,060
they took our check-in so it's probably

248
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,180
taking flight without it

249
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:30,190
