00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,680
hey guys we just got back from Deadpool

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,619
to the sequel to one of the

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,110
highest-grossing r-rated movies of all

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,980
time film that Ryan Reynolds made happen

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,880
obviously I was a huge fan of the

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,270
original Deadpool he was gonna give him

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,470
like a 9 out of 10 it was amazing it was

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,760
like this is Deadpool perfectly put on

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,850
screen directly out of the comics I was

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,920
just so happy that Ryan really pulled it

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,160
off and so there's a big fear that the

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,950
sequel will have a you know sophomore

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,890
slump or or be shitty and I'll be a good

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,530
follow-up film I can safely say at least

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,649
in my own opinion the film is awesome

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,250
and it's really worth going out and

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,489
seeing I had a great time in Deadpool 2

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,520
and despite I guess probably the only

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,530
thing I'd say is maybe a little slow a

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,140
little little slow first act but once

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,679
you get act 2 and 3 it really ramps up

23
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,660
there's some surprises in the film so

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,030
we're going to have no spoilers here and

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,340
then have a spoiler section afterwards

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,130
but let's talk a little bit about the

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,130
film you know Alex how do you feel I

28
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,750
like this one I don't know if I like

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,940
this one better than the first cuz the

30
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,310
first one was oh man I'm really good

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,550
right yeah I don't know if I came out of

32
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,289
nowhere for me to it's like yeah

33
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,119
since then the bars been getting higher

34
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,060
and higher oh no I don't know if my

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,440
expectations are screwed up I really

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,149
like this one is definitely one that I

37
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,160
would recommend if people see I mean the

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,250
the jokes were really good you know some

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,530
of them weren't exactly for my you know

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,910
my tastes but everyone else in the

41
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,349
theater seemed to really like them yeah

42
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,759
the action was incredible there was a

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,619
lot of like there was not too many

44
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,910
callbacks there's a lot of them but

45
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,459
there are a lot of little little hidden

46
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,080
jabs and he's raids if you're Atomics

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,399
manny the moai drop probably feels like

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,580
there's a lot of comic fans or if you

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,870
were a comic fan you'll like a lot

50
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,090
you're gonna yeah they're ones that even

51
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,769
went over my head like you can't draw

52
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,290
feet was that Rob Liefeld or I'm in the

53
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,190
pockets so I thought that was good

54
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,390
though there was people laughing at some

55
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,250
jokes I didn't get I think the first act

56
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,409
for me Joe was was a little slow as far

57
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,150
as the jokes go I wasn't really laughing

58
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,849
out loud you know when Deadpool one

59
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,250
started I laughed I said that movie hat

60
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,120
was like written by me because every

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,430
single joke hit in the first one and in

62
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,829
the second one the it started off slow

63
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,599
but then second and third acts every

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,849
single one hit I guess it was just that

65
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:53,390
that opening what did you think I really

66
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,489
liked it I honestly I'm gonna say I like

67
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,019
this one a little bit slightly better

68
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,310
than the first okay all right like

69
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,140
expect the unexpected in this film yeah

70
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,030
like a lot of stuff that I wanted to

71
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,790
have in like kind of blew my mind yeah I

72
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,079
don't want to spoil anything but I

73
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:11,150
really had a lot of fun with this film

74
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,019
it was funny the action McCready Ryan

75
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,620
Reynolds was being fantastic many loved

76
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,639
it so I I'd say agree on that the action

77
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,799
was really good in fact that's where

78
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,870
it's better than the first in my opinion

79
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,879
I think that there were they had better

80
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,459
villains that they go up against or at

81
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,019
least more entertaining and visually

82
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,180
entertaining villains they really tied a

83
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,810
lot of the fights to have emotional

84
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,959
gravity to them or have a reason to kick

85
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,269
some of these dudes asses and and and

86
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,250
fight and a lot of emotion and character

87
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,530
into character motivations intertwined

88
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,510
into the fights whereas the first one

89
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,190
you had you know the generic guy that

90
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,410
shows up to give him the powers right

91
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,319
hey Jed the most obscure guy and you're

92
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,780
like Nick you know he's just a baddie of

93
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,280
the week you know and he stabs you with

94
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,139
the sword and Colossus like don't kill

95
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,989
him in there argue and he gets away but

96
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,199
here the the villains were were

97
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,250
interesting and a surprise and and

98
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,400
good a good thing so big big surprise

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,590
one big surprise one thing I was worried

100
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,380
about in the film was I don't know as I

101
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,090
saw in the trailers I was getting really

102
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,390
excited about this x-force idea the film

103
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,250
yeah so we'll talk about that in

104
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,110
spoilers so it was really fun seeing

105
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,630
that come together and I do feel like

106
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,220
we're gonna see more of that in the

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,230
future but I but what was I saying oh

108
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:51,760
shit oh yeah okay so the the domino

109
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,820
domino was the one I was not convinced

110
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,380
on I was like Elena I didn't watch it

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,910
I didn't know she plays a great

112
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,560
character and I also really liked her

113
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,690
characteristic yes so that's what I was

114
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,390
saying is the Domino like kills it in

115
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,000
this film she doesn't say much but just

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,070
I can tell just her mannerisms or

117
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,840
attitude it really fit the Domino

118
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,850
character she doesn't just this a little

119
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,410
hidden gem in this film

120
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,440
it's Domino just watcher it's hilarious

121
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,780
oh yeah what's your superpower is you

122
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,479
think it's luck if you don't know it's

123
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,520
not a superpower but by the end of the

124
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,740
film you are convinced that she deserves

125
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,250
to be on the team and I want Domino on

126
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,300
my team I want her power so you gotta

127
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,880
fight your lucky guy anyway I tell you

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,520
what so I really really enjoyed the film

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,010
and I'm actually gonna side with you Joe

130
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,320
I do think I like it a little bit more

131
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,930
it's just it's a it's a different kind

132
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,630
of life yes the first is more it's way

133
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,090
more fresh because it was it did

134
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,770
something and I didn't think that that

135
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,910
Fox could do and and really it was a

136
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,910
breakout moment I think in superhero

137
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,610
films and this one just builds on that

138
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,560
and so it doesn't have you know some of

139
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,560
the impact but boy do they pour on those

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,080
references the meta stuff they're my for

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,729
some people it might actually be too

142
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,100
much but guess what buddy you're at a

143
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,400
Deadpool film just like the comics it

144
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,139
can get

145
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,150
get on you and they pour it on here I

146
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,800
Ryan Reynolds is a fat in fact part of

147
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,360
the writing team and I could tell you

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,699
know he's and I think it was a little

149
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,379
bit with the first but he had more

150
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,599
creative control here and I think that

151
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,520
me tell you could definitely tell so

152
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,680
many great jokes I got to say wouldn't

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,960
you think about the soundtrack oh they

154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,319
did a really good job there was a lot of

155
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,020
songs that like Ryan Reynolds has

156
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,279
air-supply in a lot of his movies it's

157
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,199
like a part of like Van Wilder I think

158
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,029
it was in the first ed pool it was I

159
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,279
think another one - awesome he really

160
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,139
loves that song yeah didn't know that

161
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,150
but that's true that actually is true

162
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,680
and there's so many songs in the

163
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:14,279
soundtrack but during the epic final

164
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,439
fight so to speak they've got this song

165
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,050
that plays it's hilarious and and you

166
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,550
get to hear more of it and after the

167
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,229
credits by the way stay after the

168
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,319
credits because there are two

169
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,999
mid-credits scene and then at the end of

170
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:27,990
the credits there's nothing at the end

171
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,759
of the credits but there's the song that

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,580
replays from the epic battle that is a

173
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,669
good song so man just as joe said

174
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,610
fantastic laughs great action this time

175
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,710
around the plot what did you guys think

176
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,649
of cable Joe Josh Brolin what is he

177
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:50,520
doing here

178
00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:00,810
main oh yeah I didn't know I didn't know

179
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,189
how to feel at the beginning of this

180
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,500
because I'm still wanted somebody else

181
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,229
to play - you wanted Eric Lang yes yes I

182
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,879
wanted Erin Leigh but actually did a

183
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,649
great job man I think I can actually do

184
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,860
everything don't ever sleep on Josh okay

185
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,770
this guy can do it all and convince

186
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,860
hardcore comic fans and grouchy you know

187
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,529
assholes like me that he deserves to be

188
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,960
cable and me when things

189
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,190
who can just not be he cannot be stormed

190
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,899
he's not gonna be able to pull off store

191
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,020
so they so in my opinion cable was done

192
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,550
really well

193
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,910
cable in the comics he's so multicolored

194
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,000
and sort like 90s attitude you with the

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Rob Liefeld stuff looking stuff and and

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,370
he I kind of a difficult character to

197
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,230
pull off but Josh really does it it's

198
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,260
the stoic serious sort of you know

199
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,220
grizzled veteran care yeah a lot of

200
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,660
jokes because some of the people on the

201
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,149
inner he's not tall enough to be to be

202
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,560
cable and they they make fun of them

203
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
console movie yeah they've got

204
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,570
time-traveling the film they even

205
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,760
continued the girlfriend storyline now

206
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,610
I'm happy that that wasn't really you

207
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,740
know a big part of this film they kind

208
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,089
of take care of that in the first act

209
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,890
which is good because the previous

210
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,020
Deadpool film you know she was a big

211
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,650
factor in the second and third acts so

212
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,890
they did that in a good and tasteful way

213
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,580
and I think that you know it this idea

214
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,310
by the end that they can expand on the

215
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,959
Deadpool universe

216
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,510
he obviously interacts with his old

217
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,220
buddies that we seen from the first film

218
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,640
Colossus who again is a star in this one

219
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,130
it definitely seems as if these two are

220
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,529
developing a bromance of some kind

221
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,560
they've got great chemistry maybe even a

222
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,829
little a little more look Hey Joe don't

223
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:13,380
you be judging man but I'm saying I'm

224
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,400
thinking maybe there's a little other I

225
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,040
don't know I can do whatever I don't

226
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,850
care

227
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,860
so I thought I thought that was kind of

228
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,450
interesting the way they play that up

229
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,560
and and they do sort of go to exam

230
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,920
years when I saw this in the trailer and

231
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,960
spinning around in the chair I was like

232
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,600
oh I can't wait to see his antics in the

233
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,340
house and that paid off big the jokes in

234
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,920
the house pay off big we won't talk

235
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,990
about it here except for in spoilers

236
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,410
section but yeah it's a satisfying movie

237
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,140
Deadpool fans are gonna love it

238
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,360
I think your average comic book movie

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,529
fan is gonna like it

240
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,470
fans of action fans of comedies this is

241
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,260
an action comedy it's an action comedy

242
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,410
and if you treat it as such if you're

243
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,390
down with the meta stuff you're gonna

244
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,770
really enjoy a great yeah I don't really

245
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,960
see critics probably liking this too

246
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,820
much because maybe it gets a little too

247
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,420
far into the mythos and them in the meta

248
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,920
without much debt debt to be on let lets

249
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,420
okay so it started a little bit about

250
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,850
the deficiencies of the film it does

251
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,760
sort of lack a little bit of character

252
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,250
depth they do inject quite a few

253
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,589
characters in here I mean we've got the

254
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:35,150
the old

255
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,160
what is it roommate Deadpool's roommate

256
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,600
oh forget that old grandma's name we got

257
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,800
TJ Miller's in it again yeah the cab

258
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,290
driver boy they really try to pack

259
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,970
everybody in here and when you're doing

260
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,980
that you're spreading sort of sort of

261
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,680
the screen time and the the depth a

262
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,100
little thin but they do sort of Center

263
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,470
it around the idea of family and I think

264
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,180
it works do you think the family thing

265
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,000
work everybody really got all their

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,360
little time in which was great I felt

267
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,310
like it was enough time to get the point

268
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,100
across yeah a little bit for everybody

269
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,200
what did you think was a little bit what

270
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,970
what did you think there were some stir

271
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,030
was some slow parts they I mean without

272
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,220
going into the spoiler there was it's

273
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,720
not the plot part but they spent some

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,570
time in areas of the film that it's like

275
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,170
okay we get it

276
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,330
and let's get back to either the funny

277
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,240
or the action and I mean I'm not I'm not

278
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,310
watching this because I want them to

279
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,640
have like this fully developed I mean it

280
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,959
was a fully developed plot but like they

281
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,510
really tried to like press

282
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,520
upon you some of the like the values of

283
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,200
the movie and it's like get back to cut

284
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,910
people and yeah making me laugh yeah

285
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,460
exactly I did appreciate how it explored

286
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,120
other facets of Deadpool's powers if you

287
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,010
could kind of call it that he has a

288
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,700
relationship with you know man I don't

289
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,890
know if I could say much no I'm gonna

290
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,020
say but let's go ahead and jump to the

291
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,120
final products and then we can let loose

292
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,970
okay so final verdict I'm gonna begin

293
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,330
with Alex okay I wasn't here for the

294
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,070
first time when you guys did the review

295
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,710
yes for for the first Deadpool in my

296
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,120
mind that one was like an eight or a

297
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,310
nine I mean it is like almost giving it

298
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,740
a nine yeah it's like almost legendary I

299
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,810
mean it's like a Bic eight or nine I

300
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,550
would say that tonight the first day

301
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,100
were supposed to 9 it was completely out

302
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,660
of left field I didn't know that I never

303
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,160
thought they would make an r-rated comic

304
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,040
book funny action action movie and so

305
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,290
that gets a little bit of bonus points I

306
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,850
don't think I like this one as much I

307
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,620
think it was I mean it's an excellent

308
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,360
film and everyone should go see a zombie

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,210
this woman ate there was a couple there

310
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,800
was a little bit of humor that didn't

311
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,870
quite jive with me yeah um that just

312
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,190
just wasn't there's just a little bit

313
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,350
slow but once it got going it just all

314
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,090
the way through till the end I really

315
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,500
enjoyed it but because of the little

316
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,580
hiccup in the beginning you know it

317
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,580
subverts your expectations that reminded

318
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,920
me to say subverts your expectations but

319
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,810
I think ultimately in a good way

320
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,660
Joe what is your final Gordon for me the

321
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,880
beginning didn't bother me as much as I

322
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,630
can bother you guys I still enjoyed the

323
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,150
beginning as I'm gonna have to give this

324
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,750
a 10 I liked it alright it's a 10

325
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,070
nothing like the cast the cast was great

326
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,430
there's a lot of stuff I kind of blew my

327
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,280
mind is not expecting that yeah

328
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,120
gosh break Ted Cruz was amazing and

329
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,650
there's good performances and I think

330
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,600
that the reason why it can get that is

331
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,280
because the writing is pretty strong in

332
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,260
here the writing the choreography core

333
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,780
choreography for the action you know

334
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,810
great so I'm gonna go ahead all Jesus I

335
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,100
liked it a little bit better than the

336
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,930
first get the first nine but I tell you

337
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,910
what I'm gonna give this one a 9 out of

338
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,630
10

339
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,090
so but I like it sort of in different

340
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,280
ways from the first you see the same but

341
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,290
if I had to choose between the two nines

342
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,180
this one is the one I would probably

343
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,440
watch again first over and I just

344
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,240
thought it was there's so many things I

345
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,810
want to tell you okay so nine out of ten

346
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,280
fantastic film badass seal of approval

Andrew Joshua

354
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,390
hey welcome to the spoiler section there

355
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,060
is so much to go through here in a film

356
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,190
like this it's gonna be impossible to

357
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,040
get all the little nitty-gritty meta

358
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,070
stuff but I was super happy to see

359
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,310
juggernaut juggernaut is in the mill and

360
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:27,630
he was fucking huge he did say I'm the

361
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,010
juggernaut bitch which made me really

362
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,870
happy but that was the only part of that

363
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,360
movie right right so yeah that was the

364
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,400
only good part in that it just makes

365
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
that juggernaut look so fucking stupid

366
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,920
now and I so Deadpool goes to jail and

367
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,990
so we get this little jail stuff really

368
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,900
funny jokes there as well and I just I

369
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,430
had this feeling when they were talking

370
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,290
about you the biggest guy you got to

371
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,330
start a fight with the biggest guy in

372
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,460
here that it was gonna be the juggernaut

373
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,690
and and it paid off and even better we

374
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:06,180
get to see the fight between these are

375
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:27,660
two crews only with us for like three

376
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,920
minutes x-force version one yeah

377
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,880
which they all die into including Peter

378
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
a guy who just shows up because he saw

379
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,770
the ad is what your powers did you just

380
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,140
got this mustache and this kind of like

381
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,430
white bad dad jokes look kind of thing

382
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,530
and and then there was the Vanisher who

383
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,840
turns out to be a cameo and Brad Pitt

384
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,270
Brad Pitt shows up he gets electrocuted

385
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,430
that's why you get to see him for half a

386
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,280
second Brad Pitt shows up and I love

387
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,170
that he's sort of half a second cameos

388
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,470
my favorite was when Deadpool is fucking

389
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,309
Raggedy Ann is talking shit him

390
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,919
saviours mansion and he's like why the

391
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,220
fuck there nobody nobody's ever in here

392
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,590
except for you fucking three is this all

393
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,629
we can afford this dude he looking it

394
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,450
and so while he's ranting they show in

395
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,490
the background a whole room full of the

396
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,840
entire cast the latest cast you get B's

397
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,789
Xavier fucking everybody is in there

398
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:31,580
it's there's at least like a bum or

399
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,539
something and they're just like they

400
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,330
don't want to do pieces ago they don't

401
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,340
want they were hiding from dead full all

402
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,529
the time and they're literally only in

403
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,419
there for like three seconds so they got

404
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,700
all these guys together to do a three

405
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,279
second cameo in costume in full makeup

406
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,879
and it paid off so well so a lot of

407
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,340
really good spoilers you don't we didn't

408
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,970
get to talk to you about much fuck the

409
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,789
kid is the kid in the review fuck

410
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:05,179
alright we'll talk about him here you

411
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,039
don't like him I like him and I think

412
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,100
it's because I saw him in another film

413
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,440
there's some some of did the wilderbeest

414
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,509
or something where he was in he was like

415
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,539
you know sort of that sort of that film

416
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,429
is spilling over into this film that

417
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:21,559
film was so fucking frantic fantast I'll

418
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,850
put it up on the screen behind me

419
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,649
because I can't remember what it is no

420
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,080
Joe you can't see it so look at the

421
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,289
description it was great and at least I

422
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,639
think that's the kid I hope he is

423
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:34,220
because it's the New Zealand accent but

424
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,580
he was great actor there and I thought I

425
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,200
bought the fact that there are mutants

426
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,480
and and this kid that sold it that there

427
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,889
are some uses that are out of control

428
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,990
and they did this whole storyline where

429
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,179
this kid eventually rat like fucking

430
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:50,360
destroy stuff and it's not like he is

431
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,909
apocalypse it's not they didn't go with

432
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,210
all he's going to be this god of amongst

433
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,210
the villains they really just said well

434
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,820
first off all you mutants turn our

435
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,279
fucking world into shit is what cable

436
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,259
says and and you so you don't really

437
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,690
know quite what that means it could mean

438
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,580
you know the war in the future with the

439
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,470
sandals and

440
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,030
sighing all this other stuff but it

441
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,020
could mean something completely

442
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,179
different but the reason why he's after

443
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,250
the kid is because the kid personally

444
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,210
kills his family his cables wife and

445
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,820
daughter and you know his daughter has

446
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,559
this little bear that that bear that

447
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,120
you've seen that he hangs on his on his

448
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,870
belt and because of that he goes back in

449
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,820
time to fucking murder this kid so that

450
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,700
his little family can live and so it's

451
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,429
an isolated sort of off to the side kind

452
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:41,230
of thing there's no world-shattering

453
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,990
being eating the earth or something like

454
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,470
that a revenge plot and and so I

455
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,270
respected the movie for that and it's

456
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,940
kind of you know refreshing to see you

457
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,559
know neighborhood Spider Man kind of

458
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,380
kind of film yeah

459
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,210
so I thought the kid did a great job why

460
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,559
didn't you like him I don't like

461
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,929
characters where they I have a hard time

462
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,690
believing that someone would ever act

463
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,150
like that or that someone is just pure

464
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,880
evil in the kid is pure dick 100% pure

465
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,990
like ridiculous

466
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,059
but that wasn't at all with the kid well

467
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,620
anytime the kid is acting around the

468
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,049
school he goes from in the prison's

469
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,580
they're gonna be dead pulls friend I got

470

472
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,110
scenes in the movie he is a hundred

473
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,240

474

477
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,840

478
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,210
I mean like a ruin the movie for me yeah

480
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,740

and and they buddies with Deadpool I

488
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,380
guess that's what and they and I bought

489
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,419
it because they did some flashbacks to

490
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,610
where he was actually being tortured

491
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,809
I think they caught up probably could

492
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:17,880
have pressed that element

493
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,590
little bit more kind of show these guys

494
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,350
really were fucking dicks well yes they

495
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,550
show you that they're torturing but I

496
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,620
want to see all the orderlies actually

497
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,300
do fucked up shit because they murder

498
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,100
all these orderlies they murder the

499
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,990
orderlies they murder the headmaster in

500
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,910
fact they the guy in the cab like one of

501
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,670
the persons like first damage job right

502
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,710
ready with a brick but no they were

503
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,750
saying all those orderlies and that had

504
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,880
master deserve to die and fucking cabbie

505
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,280
runs them over and then because nobody

506
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,540
wanted to kill him cuz they're all

507
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,580
heroes and stuff and the rule is no

508
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,390
killing

509
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,170
which you know Deadpool fucks up when he

510
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,330
goes on his first mission as an x-men so

511
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,400
he did that I wanted to see that from

512
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,540
the person else like oh they're playing

513
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,010
with this idea I hope we get to see it

514
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,860
we do he comes in like this football

515
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,260
trained me like he's B team he sees not

516
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,270
even B team he's like Z team you know

517
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,110
he's a trainee

518
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,660
he's a practice squad and he fucks it up

519
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,370
royally and it was just so good

520
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,030
fantastic C just great great scenes um

521
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,530
what else what was some cool that we

522
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,600
could talk about the the constant little

523
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,520
one-liners calling Josh Brolin one-eyed

524
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,860
Willy was really good I loved I didn't

525
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,160
hear that one yeah yeah he's about to

526
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,440
get shot he's he says I cut it out

527
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,540
one-eyed Willy which is great because he

528
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,820
has one eye in this movie and then you

529
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,650
know him being in the Goonies yeah and

530
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,470
all that and I love it when he was

531
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,660
calling and music oh my god you're so

532
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,510
dark are you sure you're not from the DC

533
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,910
Universe like I last saw because it pans

534
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,380
out Diggs left the right and there's

535
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,100
references to Superman - Batman Batman

536
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,850
yeah love him in the beginning jump some

537
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,410
juggernauts back he's trying to exterior

538
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,640
me is like the sun's getting really

539
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,560
great there are so many things like this

540
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,510
and it's so cool that we have so many

541
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,390
superhero films to reach into he's not

542
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,100
yet there's more reaching into other

543
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,750
superhero fans than there is almost

544
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,480
reaching into the comics that you have

545
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,520
to know so that's really cool if we have

546
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,980
this era of sort of great superhero

547
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,270
films yeah there is one character that

548
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,700
really kind of just seemed tacked on and

549
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,100
it just really had no purpose now I'm

550
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
not talking about x-force because that

551
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:30,990
was

552
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,440
setup joke 100% all these have the

553
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,690
mustaches amazing of us and yeah we

554
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,920
could talk for hours on this film

555
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,780
because I think they even reference mojo

556
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,059
like that yes spider guy that gross

557
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,770
disgusting think from a different planet

558
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,830
and and one of those you know aliens

559
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,050
comes and he's like shatter star but he

560
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,630
gets fucking destroyed like fucking

561
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,580
chopped up in blades because they

562
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,090
decided to jump out and ambush the

563
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,970
convoy in high winds it goes everywhere

564
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,790
dies everybody every everything except

565
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,170
for Domino cuz she's lucky and she's

566
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,120
obviously perfect you could follow them

567
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
for miles but the thing is what I meant

568
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,790
is so those weren't like you know sort

569
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,679
of useless characters to me that was set

570
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,110
up purposefully however that new x-men I

571
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,190
don't even know her name

572
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,559
now she's cute as hell and I love her

573
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,420
personality her bubbly personality what

574
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,850
Yuki is that her name yeah I don't know

575
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,990
how you remember that because she's

576
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,309
barely there highway highway highway and

577
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,440
and it's just like thrown in because

578
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,940
it's because they wanted to make a joke

579
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,220
that negasonic teenage negasonic mega

580
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,880
sonic lady something something is a

581
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,640
lesbian and so yeah we just yeah hey

582
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,720
she's a lesbian

583
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:57,210
you know who they like he at the very

584
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,770
end she was like in uniform and then

585
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:03,330
fighting him yeah but I don't know maybe

586
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,340
maybe some of her scenes got cut or

587
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,110
something but she kind of seemed a

588
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,760
little tacked on there but I guess it's

589
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,350
not necessary it's just hey you know

590
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,460
negasonic has this you know she's got a

591
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,660
relationship and she brought her along

592
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,309
for more backup because when you're

593
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,440
fighting to juggernaut your needs to

594
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
fuck it back up yeah

595
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,000
god they did juggernaut so well now I

596
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,550
it's so cool and the only thing I wish I

597
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,500
could see him in his original armor but

598
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,240
of course he's in his prison stuff

599
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,360
good to see ya you don't see his but

600
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,300
what I mean so they they did they murder

601
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,730
him or don't make a reference that he's

602
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,130
gotta go take care of cuz I think it was

603
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,720
somebody said before he go waiting

604
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,230
before he wakes up and I was okay I

605
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,020
missed that yeah so okay good I'm

606
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,670
juggernaut still alive they can use him

607
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,070
in the future if they want to and

608
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,990
they're all doing this slow walk sort of

609
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,390
at the end and and honestly that these

610
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,110
members Domino cable obviously Deadpool

611
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,840
are members of the x-force so I think

612
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,240
that instead in Deadpool 3 which I hope

613
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,190
this movie does well enough I asked you

614
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,380
guys doing - I asked you guys to go out

615
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,090
and see Deadpool 1 and support it

616
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,100
because it was an r-rated film and those

617
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,650
films make a far less money than other

618
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,690
films and it did well enough and it got

619
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,670
a sequel so I really want the same thing

620
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,860
for this because I would be happy with a

621
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,490
trilogy

622
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,530
I will want a trilogy I'm gonna watch it

623
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,030
again - I start to see in Avengers again

624
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,870
you saw I just had some but I'll tell

625
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,030
you what it's worth paying twice guys

626
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,430
and I want to see at least one more film

627
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,920
please Fox I think this will do well

628
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,660
enough but I think what they're probably

629
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,550
setting up is x-force it won't be

630
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,180
Deadpool 3 right that'll be x-force's no

631
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,400
actually I mean there was Comcast or so

632
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,040
somebody else is trying to buy Fox they

633
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,380
might try to outbid or something then so

634
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,360
that's still up in the air I don't think

635
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,550
they're really fully or maybe they I

636
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,570
don't know it's weird

637
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,660
um so I don't think we can bet that you

638
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,460
know that's gonna happen all that stuff

639
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,100
at least not by the through yeah so I

640
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,930
want to see three films did you guys be

641
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,420
alright with the TRO yeah I mean if they

642
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,000
put the same time and effort because

643
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,290
they put a lot of effort in this yeah

644
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,490
and then they actually put the last

645
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,020
thing that you see is how many people

646
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,910
worked on it and over how many hours and

647
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,670
then they really you can tell they put

648
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,770
time it is yeah so they got all those

649
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:36,400
cameos obviously they really yeah so 30

650
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,700
films for me and maybe one final cameo

651
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,890
in the actual Marvel Universe that would

652
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,080
be the icing on the cake guys so there's

653
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,150
so much more to talk about but we don't

654
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,950
make this thing three hours long so

655
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,650

656
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,480
what you thought of it was it better or

657
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,280
worse than the original do you think it

658
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,890
deserves a rating that we gave it and I

659
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,440
just I loved it and it's been gonna be

660
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:19,630

661
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,820

669
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,070

670
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,400
setup that he can go back and he can you

671
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,470

685
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,250
I met Ryan Reynolds here's my story

686
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,040
instead and also will you

687
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,300
we went to a showing like a press

688
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,950
showing back when like we got invited to

689
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,040
those things for green lantern and I

690
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,540
don't remember if I was wearing a Green

691
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,760
Lantern shirt and it was the premiere

692
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,020
the first time they were showing it and

693
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,360
he got out of the car and and we have

694
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,370
you know people were you know waving at

695
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,160
him and and he we made eye contact and I

696
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,170
said something I'll never forget it and

697
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,230
it's so stupid and I said you'll

698
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,670
probably be seeing a lot more of these

699
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,160
and I pointed at my shirt and he goes

700
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,350
yeah I forgot what he said it sucks dude

701
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,550
I forgot what he said I think it was

702
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,110
like well I hope so or something like

703
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,750
that and but he was super nice he

704
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,960
actually took time to you know talk to

705
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,820
people and shake their hand I was like

706
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,440
wow and ever since then I was like I

707
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,960
like that dude you know he's really nice

708
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,650
because a lot of the celebrities and

709
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,300
they go but no he was out there talking

710
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,820
to people so anyway then what's the film

711
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,780
come out of my own oh that's not going

712
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,670
sure right that's not going anywhere

713
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,960
yeah I don't I don't even have that

714
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,700
shirt anymore I don't know where it went

715
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,100
so I was like yeah that didn't work out

716
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,680
anybody it's cool that he melted didn't

717
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,990
work out and he self-references it he

718
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:54,680
kills himself we had the big time

719
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,840
awesome and that was the mid credit yeah

720
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,700
and so the only other thing I wanted to

721
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,380
mention real quick was from what I

722
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,020
mentioned in the review the meta stuff

723
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,180
around his powers they sort of explored

724
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,550
after death Deadpool which happens a lot

725
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,310
Deadpool dies a lot in the comics and he

726
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,320
has this relationship with death a

727
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,180
little bit sort of like how Thanos had a

728
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,470
relationship with death if I'm

729
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,720
remembering this right where he's kind

730
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,810
of in this world in this other you know

731
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,670
realm and universe they kind of touched

732
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,590
on that a little bit with his girlfriend

733
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,140
being in heaven and waiting for him you

734
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,080
know at the

735
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,780
so that he can have a happy ending but I

736
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,510
guess that's not she's not in heaven

737
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,740
anymore she is he fixed the timeline

738
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,780
yeah so he fixed everything see we're

739
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,940
back in time manny has a time machine

740
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,180
which is really crazy maybe we'll get to

741
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,040
see dead we'll go in the future fight

742
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,200
sentinels I don't know I'm thinking some

743
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,300
crazy stuff or they'll just say it broke

744
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,920
again I don't know it doesn't matter and

745
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,630
that's what's wonderful about Deadpool

746
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,850
franchise he could do anything he wants

747
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,920
just break the fourth wall all the time

748
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:09,220
so all right as anybody else movie watch

749
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,850
it

750
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,460
all right guys and another thing thank

751
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,200
you so much for watching

752
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,200
oh there look ok no joke the visual joke

753
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,590
Winnie the Pooh joke little baby legs no

754
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,540
I wasn't Larry is it I thought it was

755
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,190
disgusting and lame with his little dick

756
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,960
hanging down and his fucking baby legs

757
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,720
cuz juggernaut riffs in the fucking half

758
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,660
right and and he has to grow these

759
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,650
little baby legs it's a basic instinct

760
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,530
no but that's why it actually brought me

761
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:52,360
around I wasn't into it enough to try to

762
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,200
make a statement

763
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,870
cuz cable shows up obviously he's kind

764
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,520
of you know they've been fighting him in

765
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,290
this whole time and he comes to explain

766
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,730
why he's been doing this and he needs

767
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,350
their help now the juggernauts involved

768
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,210
and and they pulls like are endless to

769
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:16,330
this but hanging out and I think it was

770
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,220
like just the reaction I'm Kaila face I

771
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,340
could have gone without you said and

772
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,190
when Deadpool dies and and cable goes

773
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,730
back in time uses his last time charge

774
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,280
to it so you can't see his family

775
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,290
anymore to stay in this timeline and

776
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,700
beat Deadpool's

777
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,470
friends so we will get cable and

778
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,900
Deadpool next if it's not x-force it's

779
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
cable and Deadpool no doubt

780
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,770
it was fun and it was touching the one

781
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,310
thing I noticed I don't know if it's a

782
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,500
fuckup you guys may be here

783
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,900
smarten me and tell me what happened he

784
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,390
so when he goes back in time you'll

785
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,600
notice he does not have a robotic eye

786
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,500
anymore he still has his robot hand but

787
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,060
he doesn't have his robotic eye and I

788
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,650
think he doesn't have some of the

789
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,280
cybernetic on him it's just a robot hand

790
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,680
so by going back in affecting the

791
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,170
timeline

792
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,120
you mean after at the very end I mean so

793
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,090
so when his hand on his neck I'm not

794
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,820
sure because when his bear sort of

795
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,530
materializes and it's like his family

796
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,200
didn't get killed by the kid then I

797
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,600
think that's why he no longer has that I

798
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,210
because perhaps it was Russell the

799
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,880
little kid the New Zealand kid fire fist

800
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,610
that had hit cable with something in the

801
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,860
past as they done battle in the future

802
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,260
whatever and it fucked up his body but

803
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,380
his eyes are both clean they're clean

804
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,140
and there's no robotic pieces I didn't

805
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,670
notice the eye but I do have we saw up

806
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,190
his neck so I'm wondering if maybe the

807
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,230
grubby fucking visual heart is fucked up

808
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,940
because remember they made that meta

809
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:03,870
joke

810
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:34,000
