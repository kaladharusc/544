smashing US Army you're a rapper who

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,110
day hello everybody and welcome back to

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,600
another episode of content deputy I

12
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,310
didn't know if I was gonna have to make

13
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,619
this video or not turns out I don't have

14
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,020
to I recorded some footage in

15
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,470
anticipation of taking a massive L but

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,929
it was a big w that being said I'm gonna

17
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,490
go through the video point by point and

18
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,679
just sort of give my take on it

19
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,240
in the video you portrays feels like

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,619
this money-hungry i only care about

21
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,390
money I only care about Fame and myself

22
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,670
no I don't portray you that way you

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,409
portray yourself that way that's why I

24
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,330
used video clips of you portraying

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,220
yourself that way since he made up this

26
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,240
track I mean that's kind of what I

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,190
started and what I do he kind of like

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,959
stole that you didn't start this tracks

29
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,519
if you want to make the claim that you

30
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,530
popularized them that's perfectly

31
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,870
legitimate you're just really wet hard

32
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,489
and you just gotta give them phosphorus

33
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,049
well I don't want your prompts you can

34
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,489
shove your prompts straight up your ice

35
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:21,840
hole because I think you're a garbage

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,549
human being and I want nothing to do

37
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,010
with you well he raped you no but did it

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,459
feel good

39
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,170
so he'd made sure to put this at the

40
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,030
start of the video so everyone sees it

41
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,760
of course I did why wouldn't I your

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,590
acting is if this is some Logan Paul

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,170
Feud I'm not here to be friends with you

44
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,870
okay I'm here to explain why you're

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,359
worthy of criticism but out of everyone

46
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:43,980
I know should not be the one calling me

47
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,850
out for it rape is good like really out

48
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,019
well you have some pretty horrible

49
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,819
comprehension because I was hardly

50
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,859
calling you out for it I used it as a

51
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,959
point to illustrate that you can be

52
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,660
criticized for it I didn't say that I'm

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,060
morally superior to you because it seems

54
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,130
like he has this disregard for what he

55
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,200
can be criticized for what would he say

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,730
and I just want to spell it out hey

57
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,040
dumbass you did something stupid in the

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,230
past you can be criticized for it if

59
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,569
she's not mad why are you guys mad but

60
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,370
anyways I guess sorry isn't enough I

61
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,819
mean I guess I

62
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,489
in this video you're hyper focused on

63
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,739
the idea that people aren't forgiving

64
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,930
you even though you've apologized and

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,200
she's clearly not mad at you and you've

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
done all you can to prove that there's

67
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,060
no bad blood between you two and that's

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,310
fine that's a good first step you kind

69
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,470
of have to show that you've changed but

70
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,659
what you've done in this video is you've

71
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,769
shown that you have not changed at all

72
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,239
there's nothing to do though just to all

73
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,680
the rape victims out there and it's just

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:04:00,549
like it wasn't funny that was by far the

75
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,530
worst acting performance I've seen in my

76
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,150
life well that was so pathetic like you

77
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,620
couldn't have tried a second time and

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,069
maybe go put a little bit more low shani

79
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,409
nice nice forget about the apology

80
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:13,480
you've you figured it out hideouts eyes

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,159
jokes to where his viewers know that

82
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,870
he's joking oh it's a single piece of

83
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,440
paper that says nigger faggot another

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,860
piece of paper that says nigger faggot

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,389
but what you talking about great job

86
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,370
dude you won the argument that I never

87
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,620
made by showing clips of your black

88
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,419
friends reacting to me saying the word

89
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,820
nigger you sure are very witty and know

90
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,159
how to deconstruct an argument you don't

91
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,020
got no points because these big words

92
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,720
that your friend and someone that was in

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,699
the video roasting me is someone that

94
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,470
doesn't more than anyone on YouTube so

95
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,090
if we're to call anyone out on it and

96
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,490
who you play this isn't content cop

97
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,370
PewDiePie what's wrong with you yes if I

98
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,289
were to make a Content Cup on PewDiePie

99
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,240
I'd mentioned how he stretches all of

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
his videos out to ten minutes I

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,389
mentioned how he litters his videos with

102
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,889
ads there's things to criticize

103
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,740
PewDiePie on but guess what he's not

104
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,110
nearly as much of a fucking douchebag as

105
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,030
you a lot of people seem to think this

106
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,310
was your best point in the video but I

107
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,930
couldn't disagree more

108
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,509
this was a fucking terrible point I mean

109
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:19,419
it's it's tantamount to me mentioning

110
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,669
hey by the way dude your friend Tana

111
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,039
that you've logged with she said the

112
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,050
word nigger how do you go support a guy

113
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,039
who probably says Edward

114
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,050
Gabbie show another pretty irrelevant

115
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,330
youtuber damn I guess I do say that word

116
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,249
a lot I mean I guess I'll learn some new

117
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,589
words no the reason I showed you all

118
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,240
those clips of you saying irrelevant was

119
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,740
to show how much of a hypocrite you were

120
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,599
being if I actually wanted to show you

121
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,419
that you needed to learn new words then

122
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,089
I would have shown you this does she got

123
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,909

is Ebonics this is not Ebonics this is

129

130
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,469
making it harder on yourself why should

131
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,539
i correct the child that says Emma Lance

132

lot of haters aquila lated why aren't we

134
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,330

135
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,189
songs

136
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,180
pffft everyone's trying to take the

137
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,999
other day no fucking way

138
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:32,430
hey tell me that our most popular

139
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,260
broy cartridge one pitcher cannot pick

140
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,100
one he said in Solaria

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,260
deus ex human defiance 8-bit is high

142
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,390
dose the Lydia's videos hiding something

143
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,180
from us because he's insecure lies in

144
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,190
this section he brings up my old videos

145
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,280
and it really pisses me off because he

146
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,500
makes me look cute and adorable but I'm

147
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,750
that's not what I am I'm a tough edgy

148
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,910
guy but his main point is that people's

149
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,010
contents change with their personality

150
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,740
and to that I agree which is why I made

151
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,570
a Content comp on him in the first place

152
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,730
you said that you had high school humor

153
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,930
look what I'm trying to make is two

154
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,370
years ago I have that high school humor

155
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,200
lol as John I was just making stupid

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,120
jokes and what I'm proposing to you is

157
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,100
that your humor has not changed very

158
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,080
much at all in the span of two years

159
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,660
someone has to say it but like what is

160
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,050
that

161
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,420
who what is this Vicki I'm sorry guys

162
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,800
someone has to say it and there was that

163
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,540
one grandma in the wheelchair she really

164
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,430
liked chocolate whatever whatever they

165
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,710
kind of look alike yeah I can't say it

166
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,150
looks like the humor is that different

167
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,320
from two years ago checking in in bed

168
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,510
this is jumping in the pool anang I

169
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,000
don't know bro I've apologized for this

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,130
I've done all that I could do I don't

171
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,710
know what more you guys want me to do so

172
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,050
let's just throw these skits throughout

173
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,210
the video then make me look like a piece

174
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,100
of shit how are you gonna tell me who I

175
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,100
am as a person as if you know me get off

176
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,900
of my dick all my videos are jokes I

177
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,460
don't know how he's gonna tell me what

178
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,770
my videos are that has been so many

179
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,110
lives surrounding my name if you guys

180
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,970
haven't heard the gabbie show came out

181
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,310
and said that I hit her like these

182
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,870
neighbor you're up starting I'm calling

183
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,730
you out you cannot at all win the

184
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,680
argument that all of your videos are

185
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,130
jokes

186
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,410
so stop doubling down on this completely

187
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,450
idiotic statement but bro there's a

188
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,950
difference alright like coming up this

189
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,610
alone I'm filming them and you'll me

190
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,099
and they keep going it's completely

191
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:25,930
different from me two years ago you know

192
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,789
livestream and someone asked me am i

193
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,710
alive and I'm just like no his point

194
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,840
here is entirely moot because he gets it

195
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
wrong from the get-go because he's

196
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,289
talking about consent whereas a good

197
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,789
portion my video is actually talking

198
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,380
about filming girls without their

199
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,450
knowledge consent isn't even part of the

200
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,269
equation when you completely rob them of

201
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:50,220
the question can i film you yes or no

202
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,360
see what my monthly earnings are Oh

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,209
fucking million oh yeah as if me filming

204
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,370
you at VidCon while you're checking your

205
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,170
social blade numbers is it all

206
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,320
comparable to you breaking someone's

207
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,750
phone because they were snapchatting you

208
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,520
or you lying to girls on your string

209
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:19,290
[Music]

210
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,990
regardless no you see a parody might

211
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,500
involve some comedy in there somewhere

212
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,260
this was completely devoid of comedy

213
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,240
stop I was being a pompous asshole

214
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
character like all these people in the

215
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,440
genius videos of the video and that

216
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,850
leave the video with the most views at

217
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,589
the time was something about the era de

218
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,329
grande I think I just forgot about and I

219
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,709
really didn't get any tweets here after

220
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,329
2 weeks no one really brought it up and

221
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,040
I just went on with my life that 10k

222
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,779
might come in handy 20 years down the

223
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,070
line I know there's gonna be that one

224
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,120
guy oh my god boy you didn't do the

225
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,560
challenge you see when you run a

226
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,660
giveaway as soon as you promise an

227
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,970
amount of money like I'm giving away 10

228
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,820
grand that money is no longer yours okay

229
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,459
you have already come to terms with I'm

230
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,470
giving this money away you don't need to

231
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,089
give it to colossal even though he is

232
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,769
the rightful winner you don't need to

233
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,029
give it to the person who clickbait to

234
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,399
the Manchester bombing video what you

235
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,410
absolutely need to do is donate it to

236
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,449
charity so I've included two links down

237
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,060
below one to the Manchester bombing fund

238
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,430
and one to the most recent Las Vegas

239
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,839
shooting so I think both of those are

240
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,490
very appropriate whichever one you

241
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,320
happen to choose show some sort of

242
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,360
verification on Twitter don't make a

243
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,490
fucking video about it obviously

244
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,230
man all this blue spider stuff with

245
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,029
allegations like there were no proof

246
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,490
like people kids her take away crapper

247
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,830
beef it wasn't just him sending me shit

248
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,290
like I was saying in bars he was saying

249
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,450
at bars mag report I just want someone

250
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,850

251
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,380

252
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,440
attention I mean I dropped a lot of like

253
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,420
at this drug so he got compensated for

254
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,220
his time he saw I'd have to do this when

255
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,110
he feel himself like writing the song

256
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,399
and I mean it's a good idea I mean it

257
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,930
