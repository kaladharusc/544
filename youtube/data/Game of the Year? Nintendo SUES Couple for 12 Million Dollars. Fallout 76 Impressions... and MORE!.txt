1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,429
what's up ladies and gentleman for

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:03,990
YouTube look at you 90 day coming at you

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,549
live let's get into the power of the

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:06,660
Internet and this is my weekly gaming

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,099
news series which I talk about video

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,960
games and gaming in general and all the

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
news surrounding games so let's just get

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,190
right into the games so the game and

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,540
Wars are coming up in less than a month

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,250
and we finally got the nominees and I

11
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,960
almost always in probably will this time

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,500
do a full game Awards nominees video to

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,180
talk about the nominees and what I think

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,500
sort of win in each category even though

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm almost always wrong each year I

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,410
didn't want to take a moment here to

17
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,660
look at the game of the Year nominees

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,800
because I think there's something really

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,120
interesting here here are the

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,290
nominations and a lot of these makes

21
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,239
sense we have God of War Red Dead

22
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,520
Redemption - Spider Man Assassin's Creed

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,620
Odyssey Monster Hunter World and then

24
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,870
the indie darling and the platformer

25
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,940
Celeste so I've heard a lot of people

26
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,920
say that Celeste doesn't belong there

27
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,450
but to be honest with you it is one of

28
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,879
the better games this year even if it

29
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
does have that 8-bit retro style and

30
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,190
feel to it

31
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,199
I really do highly recommend you

32
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,399
download and play that game especially

33
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,350
because it's well worth its budget price

34
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,239
but a lot of people have said that they

35
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,500
feel that should not be on the list

36
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,210
because it's a smaller game it's an

37
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,820
indie game it doesn't deserve to be on

38
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,530
that list in a year which we had a lot

39
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,210
of other huge triple-a games of course

40
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,920
your regular battlefields and your Call

41
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,510
of Duty's but you've got your Far Cry

42
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,070
fives you've got hitman so you've got

43
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,810
Assassin's Creed's you got a lot of

44
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,060
other really big games and a lot of

45
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,470
people feel that bets should be on the

46
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,180
list instead but I'm curious as to what

47
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,830
you think I personally don't mind

48
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,080
Celeste being on that list I would like

49
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,820
to see more Andy titles and I would like

50
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,070
to see more than just six nominees maybe

51
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,170
eight maybe nine maybe ten so that

52
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,640
people know what the best games of the

53
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,409
year were a lot more games could get

54
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,880
nominated that way though it might make

55
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,860
it more difficult for people to vote I

56
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,479
don't know why they do it that way but I

57
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,610
will say I'm glad to see an indie title

58
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,649
show up on the list Celeste was kind of

59
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,149
groundbreaking in that it was one of the

60
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,829
best platformers I played in a lifetime

61
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,540
and it's very very good and I highly

62
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,220
recommend it even though it's a little

63
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,500
too difficult for me to beat I did enjoy

64
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,210
what I played with it that said I'm

65
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,500
curious as to what you think who do you

66
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,820
think is gonna win and do you think

67
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,930
Celeste should be on the list

68
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,670
let me know down below in a previous

69
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,280
episode we talked about Nintendo suing

70
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,710
ROM websites to try to get them offline

71
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,420
and we talked about them suing for over

72
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,149
a hundred million dollars well it looks

73
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,790
like Nintendo has won they have sued a

74
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,740
man and his wife

75
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,990
for a hundred and twenty million dollars

76
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,180
and they have a successfully won the

77
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,250
case now this American Arizona couple

78
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,200
owned a couple of websites including

79
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,750
love roms calm and love retro dot CEO

80
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,480
and Nintendo decided to cinema since the

81
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,070
sis letter and I guess they ignored that

82
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,190
Nintendo sued for twelve million dollars

83
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,810
and rather than have this go to court

84
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,670
the couple pled guilty and now they owe

85
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,250
Nintendo twelve million dollars they

86
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,290
also agreed to hand over any roms so

87
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,790
they had of Nintendo properties and

88
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,140
agreed to never distribute them again

89
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,660
and basically this would ruin most

90
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,130
people's lives I don't know if they have

91
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,680
twelve million dollars but they owe

92
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,610
Nintendo twelve million dollars and I'm

93
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,170
not entirely sure how that works even

94
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,030
with my research do you if you can't pay

95
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,680
it what happens I guess you pay them

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,630
monthly for the rest of your lives but

97
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,100
the point of this wasn't to destroy two

98
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,810
small lives the point of it was to scare

99
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,910
everybody else running ROM sites that

100
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,030
share nintendo roms in order to just get

101
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,130
them offline so Nintendo can continue to

102
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,900
sell you those games you know on the

103
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,730
switch or elsewhere ROM websites always

104
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,830
kind of operated on the idea that you

105
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,780
know it's not necessarily illegal for

106
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,910
you to have a rom of a game that you've

107
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,290
purchased an order you're already own

108
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,110
you have the physical copy of but not

109
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,850
everybody does and people know that and

110
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,200
so Nintendo definitely just wanted to

111
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
send a message here to other rom

112
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,800
websites to say look whether it's

113
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,540
technically illegal or not we will sue

114
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,760
you for personal damages and we will

115
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,580
probably win in court and that seems to

116
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,840
be the message that Smith sent here so

117
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,550
if you have some roms from Nintendo you

118
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,870
want to download and you can legally

119
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,910
download them you probably need to

120
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,920
legally download them now now this

121
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,600
week's episode is proudly sponsored by

122
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,070
the folks over there at Verve and I have

123
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,440
to say the mass majority of my viewers

124
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,030
have already signed up for Verve under

125
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,170
my account but if you're one of the

126
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,610
people that are still holding out you're

127
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,870
going to want to pay attention to this

128
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,090
Verve continues to add all kinds of

129
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,950
great content including this week they

130
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,990
added the boomerang channel which has a

131
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,300
lot of classic art tunes that is almost

132
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,000
impossible to find anywhere else but

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,260
besides boomerang you're going to get

134
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,030
Nick splat you're to get roosterteeth

135
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,130
geek and sundry and Nerdist and all

136
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,870
their great podcasts and shows you're

137
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,150
gonna even get access to crunchyroll all

138
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,160
of that great anime professionally

139
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,960
subtitled built right under the app and

140
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,760
speaking of exclusive content they just

141
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,140
announced the first season of the show

142
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,690
final space is going to be exclusively

143
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,460
available on Verve I just started

144
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,500
watching it and I think it

145
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,910
fantastic and I think you should check

146
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,100
it out too but the best news is if you

147
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,200
use that link right now you'll be able

148
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,930
to sign up for a 30-day trial of Verve

149
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,550
premium and start watching those shows

150
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,800
completely ad free and you'll be

151
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,810
supporting me at the same time so I

152
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,180
highly recommend that you do so a couple

153
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,380
of games out this week and I wanted to

154
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,820
look at their scores so you know whether

155
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,800
or not to purchase them battlefield 5 is

156
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,510
coming out very very soon and its

157
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,400
current score over at Metacritic is an

158
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
83 with 21 critics weighing in now

159
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,690
that's not a lot of critics so who knows

160
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,920
where it's actually going to land I

161
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,380
would expect somewhere closer to 78 for

162
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,760
this game specifically based on some of

163
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,320
the reviews that are read but let's talk

164
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,610
about the good and the bad

165
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,620
ignoring the controversy overall and

166
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,360
just focusing on the good of the game a

167
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,280
lot of the reviewers seem to say that

168
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,900
it's some very fast-paced very very

169
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,850
decent battlefield gameplay it's

170
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,620
probably the most fast-paced battlefield

171
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,820
yet you're gonna get right into the

172
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,050
action you're gonna stay in the action

173
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,150
and there is a ton of action so that's

174
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,440
probably pretty good for a battlefield

175
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,300
game when looking at the downside some

176
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,480
people have noticed some frame law

177
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,980
decision of the game other people had

178
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,270
said there's some real balance issues

179
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,919
especially when it comes to vehicles and

180
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,530
anti-air stuff and then more importantly

181
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,150
keep in mind there are several game

182
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,820
modes that will not work on the launch

183
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,740
of this game there's the the battle

184
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,970
royale mode which isn't working the

185
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,800
co-op mode which is not working those

186
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,320
are not due out until even later next

187
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,390
year so a lot of reviewers have noted

188
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,130
that if you're going to buy this game in

189
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,200
2018 realized you're not getting a

190
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,030
complete game you won't get the complete

191
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,030
game until 2019 this is games as a

192
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,490
service kind of at its worst craziest

193
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,020
thing about this release though to me is

194
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,000
that as of right now as of filming this

195
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,530
there are some people already playing

196
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,880
the game and if you got the deluxe

197
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,710
edition version of the game you're

198
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,970
probably going to be playing it by the

199
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,130
time this goes live or very very soon

200
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,720
after that but if you're buying the

201
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,100
standard version of this game the

202
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,990
standard version of the game doesn't go

203
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,210
live until next week so you want to talk

204
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,680
about games it's a service if you don't

205
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,510
get an upgraded version you're not

206
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,590
playing it till next weekend if you're

207
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,729
just gonna buy the standard version

208
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,250
anyway I would recommend waiting until

209
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,690
the other game modes actually hit

210
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,919
sometime next year because you know

211
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,510
they're gonna discount this game and

212
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,890
then by the time this goes live you'll

213
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,479
be able to pick up let's go Evie or

214
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,760
let's go Pikachu the latest Pokemon game

215
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,890
and I know a lot of players who are

216
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,390
really deep into Pokemon have ignored

217
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,039
this entry and I think that might be a

218
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,090
mistake because not only

219
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,160
reimagining of red and blue and yellow

220
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,889
and getting you to tell that story a

221
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,750
second time including Team Rocket and

222
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,229
all the classic 151 Pokemon but then it

223
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,000
ignored it because they feel like it's

224
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,250
not a corn entry to the series but I

225
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,080
have to say the more reviews I watch the

226
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,430
more I realize what I love about the

227
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,880
core entry is still mostly there there's

228
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,260
still plenty of gym battles there's

229
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,520
still plenty of trainer battles and

230
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,990
there's still plenty of post game

231
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,790
content so even though it doesn't race

232
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,260
the Pokemon go mechanics and you're

233
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,370
catching it with you know throwing

234
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,860
pokeballs in the wild I think that's

235
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,780
kind of annoying it's not the same but

236
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,220
it's not so different that I won't enjoy

237
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,780
the game even though it's supposed to be

238
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,030
fairly easy it might be worth it just to

239
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,220
see a retelling of that original story

240
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,840
though in the Kanto region and I think

241
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,130
it might be worth picking up currently

242
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,470
sitting at an 81 on Metacritic with the

243
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,240
30 critics weighing in so that's pretty

244
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,860
good I wanted to follow up on a story I

245
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,479
covered last week by the way I talked

246
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,940
about Activision having a small dip

247
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,650
after the announcement of Diablo

248
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,150
immortal and I said that it was slowly

249
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,590
rise back up over the next couple of

250
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:39,979
weeks

251
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,560
turns out I was wrong it turns out they

252
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,600
took a much deeper dip than that on

253
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,550
Friday November 9th when they announced

254
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,830
Diablo immortal they took a huge dip and

255
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,970
they have continued to drop

256
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,729
ever since specifically since they

257
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:53,990
announced their quarterly projections

258
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,940
and quarterly earnings showing that

259
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,289
revenue is down quite a bit

260
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,090
basically that earnings report said that

261
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,770
numbers are down across the board for

262
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,360
people playing their games and on top of

263
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,830
that the people that are playing are

264
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,380
spending less money so games as a

265
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,510
service is not exactly working for them

266
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,490
so it's very bizarre to me that they

267
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,229
continue to push mobile which is almost

268
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,450
always games as a service games like

269
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,520
hearthstone have less players than ever

270
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,889
game like destiny 2 is maintaining to

271
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,900
struggle their player base in a epic

272
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,460
game like Call of Duty which still has

273
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,650
plenty of players those players seem to

274
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,080
be spending less on micro transactions

275
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,700
due to the predatory nature of those

276
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,560
micro transactions but if you remember

277
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,300
EA also reported something similar

278
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,860
saying that their players are spending

279
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,900
less and less on micro transactions all

280
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,370
the time and even though there's still

281
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,839
hundreds of millions of dollars to be

282
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,880
made there maybe this is the beginning

283
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,800
of the turning point maybe players like

284
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,420
you and I are spending less and less

285
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,920
money on these games that we've already

286
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,200
bought and maybe just maybe this entire

287
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,780
predatory age will have come to an end

288
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,160
hopefully if we keep our fingers crossed

289
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,350
and we hope hard enough and we keep our

290
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,980
wallets on our paws

291
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,899
it's maybe we'll just be able to buy

292
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,420
complete games again one day

293
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,610
probably not and then finally fallout 76

294
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,139
launches this week you've probably

295
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,820
already played it by now if you are

296
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,230
going to play it but here's what I will

297
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,300
say if you're still on the fence about

298
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,639
this game keep in mind that the launch

299
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,829
day week of these types of games is

300
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,690
always difficult all of these

301
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,519
multiplayer games their servers are

302
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,320
getting hammered it is very difficult to

303
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,610
log in to those games I don't recommend

304
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,079
taking a day off work or anything like

305
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,940
that I would definitely wait until

306
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,740
things even out a little bit because

307
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,089
even though this game has gotten a lot

308
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,470
of backlash from users and a lot of

309
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,000
backlash from youtubers it still seems

310
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,949
like it's sold very very well and

311
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,269
there's still plenty of people eager to

312
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,220
play and there are currently no reviews

313
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,050
to point to because with a multiplayer

314
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,910
online game like this you kind of have

315
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,889
to wait until after they launch you

316
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,320
can't review an MMO the day they go live

317
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,820
because you've not actually played the

318
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,500
game the way it is meant to be played so

319
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,699
keep in mind if you're one of those

320
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:47,899
people that are waiting for reviews you

321
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,389
need to continue to wait now I can give

322
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,250
you some anecdotal evidence of my

323
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,810
experience playing it on launch last

324
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,040
night I had a lot of trouble staying

325
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
connected to the servers but I did get

326
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,519
to play a couple of hours and my beta

327
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,220
character did roll into the game it

328
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,139
still felt pretty bereft of content but

329
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,240
when I met another player I had a lot of

330
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,579
fun playing with other people again if

331
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:08,930
you want to go into this as a social

332
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,459
game I think you'll have a lot of fun if

333
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,319
you want to play it solo I don't know

334
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,029
how much fun you'll have the crafting is

335
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,800
there it's fallout 4 it's basically a

336
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,920
giant fallout 4 mod that's probably

337
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,050
worth the $60 if you're crazy about

338
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,940
fallout 4 just keep in mind there's not

339
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,829
much for storyline it's just you

340
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:26,449
interacting with a lot of bots and a lot

341
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,190
of terminals and then finally the fun

342
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,079
part interacting with other players

343
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,380
which can be annoying or great depending

344
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,699
on the player you meet if you didn't

345
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,199
decide to preorder that game and you do

346
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,610
decide you want to pick it up or at

347
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,380
least consider picking it up I would

348
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,760
just keep playing whatever game you're

349
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,380
playing right now and watch some people

350
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,819
play it on stream watch some people play

351
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:45,860
it on YouTube and make sure it's a game

352
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,449
that you want to get into there's no

353
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,040
real spoilers for you here because it's

354
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,110
not a full game without much of a story

355
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,149
it's just kind of a cool sandbox and if

356
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,529
you enjoy that kind of thing you might

357
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,569
enjoy this know that the PC version ran

358
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,010
a heck of a lot better last night that

359
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,380
it did in beta with the day one patch so

360
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,519
you'll definitely want to wait till a

361
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,260
few more patches get in and the game is

362
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,970
gonna run even smoother after that all

363
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,529
right that's gonna do it again for this

364
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:07,850
