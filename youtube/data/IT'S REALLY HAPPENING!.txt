1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,780

9
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,610
morning

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,829
today it's just a bonkers day because i've had this crazy idea for a movie

11
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,229
that requires like a lot of traveling a lot of logistics some risk to my

12
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,750
personal well-being in the last couple like weeks i had like a branded content

13
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,009
like a company is willing to give me money to make a youtube video anyway I'm

14
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,030
doing it I've got the budget only trouble is I have to shoot it like

15
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,619
tomorrow this weekend and i've got nothing planned when I say this is

16
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,300
logistical complicated i mean this involves like travel airplanes thousands

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,200
of miles in between here and the location probably a helicopter maybe a

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,220
jet ski some icebergs a few nah I need somebody to go with me ask you might

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,179
come with me

20
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:42,009
and it's all happening like tomorrow so i figured that out also a special guest

21
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,170
in the office today

22
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,170

talk about a battle

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,960
the top of it

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,260
pretty deliberate next this place to move up here like at least three times a

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,880
week but that will come here so often the most people safe are they say pho

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,880
pho thought tom was like

32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,989
it's the right one time well more

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,250
I talked to a scrub your back

34
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,630
yeah are you down to leave tomorrow

35
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,430
shoot icebergs on Saturday fly back sunday morning

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,810
it's possible yeah I would I mean I would rather leave as late as possible -

37
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,780
I don't know I have this guy who seems awesome who's got the helicopter the

38
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,130
icebergs

39
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,360
maybe a jet ski and all the other things that we need and he's in

40
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,560
that's all I got I'm moving my phone that has all the important

41
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,880
yeah

42
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,130
ok

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,500
yeah

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
yeah

45
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,880
you bring that thing for him yeah

46
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,770
ok so here's what i got it says looks good weather walk if that's the case you

47
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,380
can use any jet ski because the heli can sling 2,500 pounds i think that means

48
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,370
they're going to use a bigger helicopter which can carry a bigger jet ski to take

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,140
the icebergs this time I've never met is what is setting all this stuff up for us

50
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,280
he's awesome

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,230
this is exactly how you should never never plan a movie we can have you cliff

52
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,030
jump off of icebergs

53
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:16,709
oh yes the only thing is the waters 34 degrees so will literally die for it for

54
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,290
more than 60 seconds 60 seconds

55
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:26,310
that's what he said yeah but he's got dry suits hey it's casey you're on the

56
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,280
phone with with my co-conspirator Oscar and I and we're just trying to figure

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,050

65
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,490

parachuting to the lake

72
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,419
probably out of the question but there's nowhere to get theirs there's no way to

73
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,600
get the grizzly bear in the helicopter

74
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,880

79
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,610
why is Oscar come is literally the only friend i could think of that would

80
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,759
