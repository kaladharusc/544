4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,389
PIO box that is still closed down until

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,190
further notice these are just the

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,180
packages that I have not yet opened

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,050

room wasn't red and black enough already

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,309

11
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,079
fulfill my role as being the gayest

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,360
vampire hunter this is actually like

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,329

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,860
cancer blade it's it's got like cushion

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,800
in there and everything I'm going to cut

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,539
you oh yeah I could open the rest of

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,440
packages with this man smart thinking

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,030
maybe I'll make a rule if it comes from

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,520
Amazon I open it if it comes from a fan

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,750
and it's a shit like the one downs box I

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,910
never open it it immediately gets thrown

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,430
in the trash says notice me senpai on

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,260
the front of it this is gonna be awful

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,390
well since I'm a gay vampire magician

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,790
we're gonna play stab a box game there's

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,159
a kitten that was barely hanging on to

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,640
life

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,799
barely here's a little guy here's a bit

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,490
of a Reptar looking guy when he sent

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,250
this from back in the day I imagine you

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,250
probably sent it with the thought in

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,860
your mind that oh he's totally gonna eat

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,310
this

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,130
however I've evolved since those videos

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,020
it's just fucking meat

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,720
I will there it is you know no harm no

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,470
foul I might sink my finger into it this

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,960
is kind of cool if this is legit live

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,020
harvester ants open immediately you see

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,759
the problem with this right is they're

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,130
fucking dead but let's find out how dead

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,360
oh yeah really dead the dichotomies a

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,340
little bit weird too to be sending a

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,619
lollipop with ants suspended on the

45
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,079
inside and also an ant works

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,659
Space Age habitat for ants this one is

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,759
I'd imagine pretty good for ants this is

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,619
actually just dead ants that you sent me

49
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,080

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,360

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,490
where you hear sand and shit rattling

57
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,680
around on the inside to the faggot who

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,450

73
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,480
pretty played out so here's a gift card

74

77
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,430
thought was sent by another one of these

78
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,020
companies that just sends you dumb

79
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,970

check for $2,700 this isn't my check no

81

anything with big red lips that's black

106
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,900

165
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,970
folks out there but it's a lizard a

166
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,760
lizard with penis arms that articulate

167
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,030
and a little Hitler riding on the top

168
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,160
just for all the edgy kids out there

169
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,140
yeah it's pretty good it has some

170
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,330
features requires a little bit of effort

171
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,530
but the nice thing about this is a boom

172
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,150
of food is you can just pop the tail

173
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,310
right out and then it could be a baby

174
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,300

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,200
make this whole video better by

184
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,300
