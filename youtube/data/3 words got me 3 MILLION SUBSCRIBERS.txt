1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
I got you guys some snacks

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
all right you three go let's and three dollars prices

3
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,730
yeah

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,320
yeah

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:02,400
none of the stuff off with thank you

6
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:23,560
yeah

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,730
yeah

8
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,990
yeah

9
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:37,060
three million out of this world

10
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,409
three million subscribers

11
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,390
when I crossed the 1 million threshold and then when across the two million

12
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,170
threshold

13
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,460
I tried to make videos that share some insider some the things that I've

14
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,619
learned on my process to getting there and I it feels a little different this

15
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:04,600
time i will say without reservation the first million is the hardest the first

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,759
million took me five years

17
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,620
the second million took me like five months something then this last million

18
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,269
took even less time

19
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,650
you know it's like it's like a snowball when it's really small it only picks up

20
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,700
a little bit of snow but as the snow ball gets bigger it picks up more and

21
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,700
more snow and the channel just grew so fast

22
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,410
this is not cocaine this is fake snow is going to use it to illustrate these

23
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:37,510
snowball analogy but i'm not sure what happens let's see what o.o

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
and dreamy of the why

25
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,800
hope that analogy makes sense I only have one piece of advice to offer on

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,370
this round on this 3 million and that one piece of advice was given to me by a

27
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,319
guy named Roman Atwood

28
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,590
it's the best piece of YouTube advice I've ever been given

29
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,510
it was three words just keep uploaded

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,570
John Barr go around what's that

31
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,500
hi jack I know so Oscar

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,660
you've seen him in the videos before Oscar and I Oscar Oscar moved here from

33
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,130
Argentina was looking for a job he applied for a job to work for my brother

34
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,580
and he hired him on his third day in New York City and he and I have been working

35
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,100
together ever since he associate produced by HBO series and now he's like

36
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,870
a big time movie producer but my short advice for Oscars that he's too good of

37
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,410
a filmmaker to be a movie producer and that he should just be making videos

38
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,060
more specifically just putting them on the internet hearing it from you then

39
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,600
that's about as encouraging as I can as it can be but I just think you're like

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,000
you have a unique skill set that would just do so well on youtube

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,270
we just go yeah that's it

42
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,310
so you remember how to ride that thing

43
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,430
take it easy

44
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,430
that's pretty good for a newcomer do you make it

45
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,410
detective again through there

46
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,690
this we're going to the greatest military in years

47
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,690
what's a milliner

48
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,070
yeah

49
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,820
Oscar is one hundred percent the only friend I have we get a custom handmade

50
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,800
from the customers and make her wear the hat and I've done a lot of ads here

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,650
actually I don't wear them at off their amazing who that is a good-looking hat

52
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,260

54
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,720
you can't do it every day then you're kind of a douche bag unless you're like

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,720
really cool it looks great on you have

56
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,330
