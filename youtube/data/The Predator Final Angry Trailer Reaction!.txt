1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,100
okay you guys just let us know about the

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,029
final V predator trailer from Fox and

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,670
I'm excited about this one Joe the last

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,519
trailers have been kind of mediocre but

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,679
the saving grace is it's written by

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,410
Shane Black and he was actually in the

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,340
first predator

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,400
well considering the other films I think

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,810
you only have to go up from here right

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:31,289
yeah oh AVP right I can hate the wind in

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,600
a VP because the comic books are amazing

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,610
but Shane black not only was a writer in

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,350
the first one who actually acted it and

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,290
he was one of the commandos in there and

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,090
so he's also writing this one so I'm

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,860
hoping that this is gonna be good so

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,170
let's check it out together and three

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:56,210
two one go he's done something crazy

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,510
right

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,609
okay I'm gonna talk over it a little bit

21
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,230
so we don't get copyright I guess this

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,609
here is our main character who's gonna

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,060
lead the team yes doing a lot more urban

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,350
something happens to do with a criminal

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,530
bus

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,080
as a predator ship from when the kid was

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,520
controlling it and one of the other

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,570
dream is facing what oh yeah that looks

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,110
straight out of the original predator

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,729
but if you got a lot of this kind of

31
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,530
comedy stuff whoa there were a lot of

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,780
soldiers that's just saying they killed

33
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,420
my man that's that's gonna be like two

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,860
of them yeah this is the big-ass

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,330
predator that we saw from the last alien

36
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,130
isn't it I didn't know the Punishers in

37
00:01:48,130 --> 00:02:00,369
it I fuckin loved him dude oh wait was

38
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,140
that guy have a pulse rifle

39
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:28,360
oh no that's probably a g36 Thomas Jane

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,209
what the fuck predator dogs it's pretty

41
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:31,720
dogs

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,549
fredita fredita I think they're

43
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,079
hellhounds Joel just because I know Oh

44
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:41,400
Jodi's going after the military

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,890
holy moly shit I don't like the fucking

46
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,590
slow I fucking hate the song I don't

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,690
think that matched the trailer at all

48
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,760
but I gotta say that was cut together

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,450
with like a fuck ton of action going on

50
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,859
a core which is awesome jeez okay that

51
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,260
trailer was really wanting to put butts

52
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,299
in the seats yeah like they were get

53
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,030
maybe giving away too much there those

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,220
two predators uh-huh all the printed

55
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,829
dogs yeah hellhounds they're hellhounds

56
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,590
but that's just so much I know what are

57
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,090
you worrying that the film might be a

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,730
little too busy I think so and then we

59
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,200
it appears like the Predators are

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,390
attacking a military fucking base yeah

61
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,100
and then you have like the one predator

62
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,720
versus another brother how does that

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,450
factor in there oh my god guys there's a

64
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,220
lot to go over on this one

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,410
Joe seems skeptical but that trailer

66
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,370
kind of made me a little bit excited

67
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,880
going on so yeah yeah yeah it does seems

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,220
a little bit out there in terms of what

69
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,560
tone it wants to take and I can't tell

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,209
if it's just cuz the trailer got a rap

71
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,980
music blaring and you've got like the

72
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,830
jokes non-stop it just looks like it's

73
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,450
gonna be a fun time but I hope when we

74
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,640
actually get her but yeah Shane black

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,090
takes is serious because he I think he

76
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,590
knows how important predator is to

77
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,120
people and this kind of almost looks

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,580
like just like a like a crappy popcorn

79
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,920
flick in certain elements something it's

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,510
gonna be just one of those my gay I'm

81
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,000
entertained this is good I just want it

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,799
to be better than like Robocop you

83
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,390
remember that fucker cuz this one this

84
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,660
this guy here reminds me of the

85
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,790
replacement Robocop guy and then how

86
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,770
that movie just really didn't work out

87
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,140
but look um I have some faith in Shane

88
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,020
black because you know he's a good rider

89
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,770
he's got a certain style in his movies

90
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,750
when he's the director like is here I'm

91
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,810
not really seeing it here but you know I

92
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,820
am excited by all these elements okay so

93
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,590
obviously here is our team now these

94
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,470
guys will never ever be as charismatic

95
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,460
as Dutch or matrix nor when I was saying

96
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,110
matrix is from commando Arnold and you

97
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,080
know the whole with Ulen yeah so these

98
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,210
guys are never gonna have the charisma

99
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,580
of Jesse Ventura and the rest of the

100
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,300
team do I do you like this team Joe do

101
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,660
you think you'll care when when shit

102
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,919
starts to hit the fan right now no I'm

103
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,990
gonna be honest I mean I normally know

104
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,630
him from from these are all comedian

105
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,030
comedians they all have the little jokes

106
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,430
going on my know he's trying to branch

107
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,169
out and do different things and they are

108
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,820
Marines I was wondering if

109
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,830
yeah cuz they just left the Veterans

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,320
Hospitals that's right so these are all

111
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,620
Marines on yes I actually never noticed

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,970
that Thomas Jane was in this movie I'm

113
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,510
probably like a man leave alone I love

114
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,180
dating all right so we got Game of

115
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,460
Thrones going on in here we got some

116
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,620
charismatic people these guys like

117
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,370
sailing military hearing right yeah all

118
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,020
right so we know that the team is not

119
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,910
gonna be up to standards but what about

120
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,220
the predator one of the coolest things

121
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,650
in the predator the original predator

122
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,140
film and even predator 2 is how they

123
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,690
kind of subtly expanded on the predator

124
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,640
lore especially in predator 2 without

125
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,560
really like spelling things out for the

126
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,020
audience how dumbed-down is this film

127
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,730
going to be it kind of looks a little

128
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,730
dumb in comparison to predator and even

129
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,800
and now predator 2 got a little silly

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,070
but still there's gonna be a lot of

131
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,620
jokes it's it's like a it's it's a movie

132
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,800
for a different time honestly and we're

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,090
gonna have to see everybody's having a

134
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:54,680
good time smiling man character there

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,810
Billy all right so getting into the

136
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,820
analysis here I'm excited about this

137
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,140
because it looks like we have an

138
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,910
entirety I thought it was a pulse rifle

139
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,740
just because of that little handle but

140
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,340
no that's G's 36 anyways is that the

141
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,200
printer right there no that's just to do

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,600
with dreads right he's too skinny to be

143
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,370
the predator so I think they go

144
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,200
investigate what's going on and they're

145
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,220
getting attacked here Oh something's

146
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,140
going on right outside of the bus you

147
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,910
think these are connected yeah there's

148
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,860
like a convoy and then so that's the

149
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,990
security team protecting the convoy and

150
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,000
they're like what but they're noticing

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,570
the same thing right there's no flash of

152
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,860
the explosion here so we don't know

153
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,690
what's happening it might be that these

154
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,150
two are confronting them each other and

155
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,590
they're all watching yeah that's gonna

156
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,860
be a different story so yeah so I am

157
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,650
most excited about this one because you

158
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,230
know what was it Adrian Brody's

159
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,980
predators was alright it wasn't like

160
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,220
garbage or like a really bad film and it

161
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,870
also expanded on the predator lure that

162
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,430
there's different factions of fredda

163
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,320
ters and stuff so but I don't remember

164
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,150
one faction being so much more

165
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,970
physically imposing than the rest what I

166
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,710
was theorized that you know he's a

167
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,840
bounty hunter and he arrested this guy

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,850
and he's on his way back and then he

169
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,370
breaks out and then yeah this one the

170
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,230
first one mm-hmm this one on the left

171
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,000
has to work with the humans

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,880
that would be cool because that

173
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,470
resembles the comic book storyline that

174
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,340
I wanted for AVP where the Marines and

175
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,950
one of the predators you know confront

176
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,780
each other and he gets hurt and the

177
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,160
Marines are transporting this hurt

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,650
predator is actually just fucking people

179
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,840
up though yeah the Predators think those

180
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,010
Marines are attacking and they're not

181
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,169
eventually they work together against

182
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,450
the aliens so maybe we'll be working

183
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,950
together against this guy because

184
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,770
obviously does it show if heat the

185
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,760
bigger one is the one with the

186
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
hellhounds or is it the smaller one good

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,380
question let's check so we're gonna get

188
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,600
some predator vision he's got a shoulder

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,970
cannon this other one looks doesn't it

190
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,650
look like he's got a shoulder cannon

191
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,840
looks like that's why I'm saying he's

192
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,820
worse or something you can kind of see

193
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,450
it Thomas Jane this one I think is our

194
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,320
original predator see I'm not a big fan

195
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,230
of that song because for me with the

196
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,120
predator it's a sci-fi film it's part

197
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,460
horns part action but I guess they're

198
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:29,140
going all popcorn throwaway film here oh

199
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,940
yeah they're totally gonna get fucked up

200
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,360
in the and we got a new C they use the

201
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,040
net in the second one now they're using

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,240
a spear or a what we call this a harpoon

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,360
rope spear thing

204
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,330
Olivia buns in it let's see how long she

205
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,010
does

206
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,070
just destroys everybody in that truck

207
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,960
see that's the stuff that that that that

208
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,540
scares me here is like her let's name it

209
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,790
the predator that's cool right you know

210
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:16,800
and that's how the Predators got it yeah

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,260
we've got a seriously crazy cast of

212
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,730
characters how it's all gonna fall

213
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,910
together I do not know but I'm excited

214
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:34,680
for it yeah the big boys big boy is the

215
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,890
hunter is a hunter don't know if the

216
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,110
small one is a part of some kind of

217
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,870
enforcement or police force or something

218
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,240
I don't know

219
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,830
you're right Joe it was the big one that

220
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,170
brought the dogs this looks fucking

221
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:49,860

222
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,030
is he coming in here like how is this

223
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,640
guy getting thrown ok we're seeing all

224
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,620
this on a security cam footage this is a

225
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,390
predator attacking explain to me that

226
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:14,700
blood split what do you get no blood no

227
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,370
what he's saying is he was hit so hard

228
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,570
that blood sprayed from his body so hard

229
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,980
that it ripped through his clothes and

230
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:35,490
his body armor what is this this movie

231
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,010
is gonna be crazy is she shooting we got

232
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,970
fucking jet fighters attacking the the

233
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,620
predator ship alright this needs to be

234
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,830
seen you guys need to go out and watch

235
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,920
this movie so we can see now what do you

236
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,350
think of the CGI man some of this kind

237
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,570
of looks a little what do you call it

238
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,860
washed out I don't know whenever he was

239
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,950
like slice

240
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,700
well this bigger predator is 100% CGI

241
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,850
that's the problem I'm a big fan of the

242
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,740
real yeah right here right here this

243
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,079
part it looks kind of like he's just

244
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,889
moving too fat and it doesn't look real

245
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,350
it just looks so weird yeah it's brutal

246
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,670
yeah it's crazy but one on one fight why

247
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:43,139
did Jesus yeah whatever

248
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,120
the predator I'm right for the big guy

249
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,779
is everyone all you guys to go out and

250
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,279
see the predator cuz I'm hearing it's

251
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,320
not tracking - well like it might be a

252
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,209
bust or something like that is only

253
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,860
maybe thirty million or I can see how

254
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,410
people see that right but but maybe I

255
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,910
think maybe it's the way it's being

256
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,370
marketed or I don't know please go out

257
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,110
and see the predator whether it's bad or

258
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,269
good if it's bad let's make fun of it

259
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,820
and tear it apart if it's good we know

260
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,410
it's not gonna be as good as predator oh

261
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,019
no you can't ever know but I'm

262
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:16,480
interested is it gonna be better than

263
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,230
predator - I like predator - a lot with

264
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,420
Danny Glover's I'd say that's more oh

265
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,470
yeah yeah I like it

266
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,480
so we'll see is it gonna be better than

267
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,779
