1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,760
another big thing and I was very nervous

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,799
to talk about this but I am gonna talk

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,870
about it I had a wait I had a meeting

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,330
with a weight loss surgeon and we have

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,410
officially started his program to get me

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,470
ready for bariatric surgery with that

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,960
will come a lot of tests and a lot of

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,449
stuff he said it would be potential

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,670
possible that I could qualify for

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,560
surgery in those littles 30 months the

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,340
more I talk about people with who had

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,960
bariatric surgery they talk about six

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,210
weeks a hell to get you a lifetime of

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,210
improvement and they say that six weeks

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,250
chronic depression creeps in and that

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,649
and the the misery Creek creeps in and

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,899
the the physical you know the weight of

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,910
everything and the the pain and

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,110
everything just kind of weighs on you

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,940
and I thought am I gonna be able to work

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,910
here in that six weeks and am I gonna

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,340
have to cut back on work to find more

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,379
time to exercise I'm gonna have to cut

24
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,270
back from this because of chronically

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,800
depressed dealing with it and what is

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,820
that gonna mean for the channel what's

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,660
that gonna mean for the YouTube

28
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,160
algorithm what's that gonna mean for my

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,359
viewers what's that gonna mean for the

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,430
twitch stream of Watchers what it was

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,000
sickening routine for me oh and it's

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,010
gonna hurt my bottom line you know I

33
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,780
worry about is it gonna hurt the

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,040
algorithm for you who won't be able to

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,090
find my videos anymore

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,020
what's it gonna do what's that I know

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,540
you will be there for me if I cut back

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,040
so that I have to exercise more and move

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,900
more and get this weight off of me and I

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,210
know that I know that and I know that

41
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,280
but I'm scared

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,439
tomorrow surgery date doesn't matter

43
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,850
whether drastic changes and yes is a

44
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,759
drastic change to rip my insides apart

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,560
and have them function change the way my

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,450
body functions forever yeah that's a

47
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,920
drastic change but I want to do anything

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,490
I'm willing to do anything to finally be

49
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,009
able to enjoy the world we've created

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,299
for me and I want you to be able to

51
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,829
enjoy it with me so we're gonna go do

52
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,810
what needs to get done and now here we

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,649
are one year later post surgery a lot

54
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,780
has changed in that year and we'll talk

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,369
about it we'll talk about the ups will

56
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,220
talk about the downs but do I consider

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,170
it a success right now absolutely I

58
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,060
think was the smartest decision I ever

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,360
made

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,490
said it's not all perfect let me show

61
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,880
you so this is what I'm dealing with now

62
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,050
and it's pretty different I mean you can

63
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,330
see everything is just sagged everything

64
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,130
has fallen you still see the bruises

65
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,170
from the broken arm I have a tremendous

66
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,990
amount of loose skin here and here that

67
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,990
maybe you ventually will get removed I

68
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,510
honestly don't know and there's a

69
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,740
tremendous amount of loose skin here

70
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,380
this is this is not safe for YouTube

71
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,880
this is not safe for life I don't even

72
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,740
like looking at it but but it's a pretty

73
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,320
pretty tremendous difference so far that

74
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,860
180 pounds makes so 360 pounds is still

75
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,930
a very very fat person I am very very

76
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,450
large but 180 pounds lost is an entire

77
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,130
person if you're actually measuring from

78
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,190
the fattest I ever was I was actually

79
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,080
597 pounds from so from there to 360 but

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,860
since surgery 540 pounds to 360 I've

81
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,840
still got a lot of weight to go though I

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,730
reached the target weight from the

83
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,440
surgery in that first year and a half

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,750
that first 18 months I need to lose an

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,810
additional hundred pounds so I'm pretty

86
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,820
far off target so far but let's focus on

87
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,040
the good first the 180 pound lost

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,799
difference has changed my life

89
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,070
dramatically

90
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,200
certainly I look different though I'll

91
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,060
never be pretty I'll never be a good

92
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,560
looking guy and I understand that

93
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,620
especially once this shirt comes off

94
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,810
however it has improved my ability to

95
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,209
sleep at night my ability to work my

96
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,489
ability to enjoy my life the ability to

97
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,250
just do what I want to do and experience

98
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,930
the world in a way that I want to

99
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,489
experience it it's I'm a completely

100
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,400
completely different person in fact this

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,110
is healthier than I've ever been since I

102
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,030
was in high school I feel like a kid

103
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,530
again it's it's great I'm still dealing

104
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,700
with the lower back pain and the knee

105
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,989
pain but it's less than it's ever been

106
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm still very limited by it but less

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,830
limited than I've ever been

108
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,320
probably even since I was 16 but what it

109
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,480
really comes down to it is prior to the

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,310
surgery I was dying and if you saw my

111
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,959
previous videos you know that I

112
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,730
explained that my blood pressure was

113
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,019
completely out of control I was having

114
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,780
heart issues I was diabetic all of that

115
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,910
stuff is reversed I am healthier than

116
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,590
I've ever been for all intents and

117
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,180
purposes it's entirely possible that

118
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,669
I'll live another 10 15 20 years when

119
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,560
the reality of it is probably prior to

120
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,330
the surgery I was looking at maybe three

121
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,740
or five years max

122
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,169
though quantity of life improved quality

123
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,620
of life improved kind of have you also

124
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,699
been following me over the last year

125
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,600
you'll know that I went through a

126
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,060
divorce I've been screwing up on twitch

127
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,319
I've been screwing up here on YouTube

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,460
I've been doing all kinds of stupid

129
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,949
stuff and and it really just comes down

130
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,720
to the fact that I have not been the

131
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,870
best me that I could be and I I feel

132
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,190
like a lot of that has to do with the

133
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,289
fact that the chronic depression is back

134
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,940
the anxiety is through the roof I've

135
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,440
been going through some really tough and

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,229
stupid stuff but mostly it's just that

137
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,270
I've not been able to use the only self

138
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,789
medication that I was ever able to use

139
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,889
to help with that stuff and that was

140
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,800
food and try as I might I just could not

141
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,930
poison myself with those delicious foods

142
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,639
the way that I always used to going

143
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,320
through withdrawal from a food addiction

144
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,539
is stuff going through a divorce at the

145
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,180
same time is equally tough going through

146
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,430
all of the other life changes that come

147
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,370
with a divorce is absurdly difficult I

148
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,560
thought for sure by now I would not have

149
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,880
a youtube channel anymore

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,530
I thought my audience would hate me I

151
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,389
thought nobody would tune in to watch I

152
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,099
thought I would just be a sad-sack

153
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,949
person and some shithole apartment here

154
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,110
in my town playing video games I

155
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,550
couldn't afford to play with nothing to

156
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,259
do I thought for sure I was screwed it

157
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,050
up I came really close so far and who

158
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,340
knows I might screw it all up by the

159
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,990
time it's over with but so far so good

160
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,550
I'm still keeping my head above water

161
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,770
I'm shocked by that every day but if I'm

162
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,330
being entirely honest with you and I

163
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,889
want to be entirely honest with you

164
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,680
I absolutely screwed up my recovery

165
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,770
process by trying wrong foods by eating

166
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,960
wrong foods by doing the wrong thing by

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,630
not exercising enough I let the

168
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,520
depression win at some points I let the

169
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,070
addiction win at some points not most of

170
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,320
the time and on average I did pretty

171
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,630
good but certainly some of the times I

172
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,550
just screwed right up the good news is

173
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,130
when I did screw up the surgery did what

174
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,719
it was supposed to do and acted like a

175
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,419
forced rehab when I tried soda again I

176
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,919
found out that I could drink only a tiny

177
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,750
tiny little bit and it ended up making

178
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,969
me feel very bloated and very sick when

179
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,919
I try to eat ice cream again I ended up

180
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,169
getting severe stomach cramps and

181
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,630
intestinal cramps and diarrhea it just

182
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,430
made me miserable and when I did find

183
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,469
naughty foods and bad foods that I could

184
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,150
eat the good news is I could only eat a

185
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,219
small fraction of it I would get that

186
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:40,050
Big Mac and only

187
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,400
be able to eat half of into this day I

188
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,780
can really only need half of a Big Mac

189
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,240
and throw the rest of it away and and

190
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,129
that's a big incentive to not even

191
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,349
bother eating those types of foods it

192
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:50,789
doesn't mean that sometimes I don't give

193
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,800
him right about January of last year I

194
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,770
had about 385 pounds and I plateaued

195
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,629
there and I stayed there and I

196
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,970
discovered it was no longer easy to lose

197
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,740
weight so I had to start making actual

198
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,110
dietary choices and actual dietary

199
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,800
decisions

200
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,349
I needed up my exercise I needed to do

201
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:08,699
more and even though I found it very

202
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,620
difficult to do with the depression I

203
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,690
found it very difficult to do with the

204
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,400
frustration and the stress that I was

205
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,750
under and everything else I was dealing

206
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,969
with I found it doable and I started

207
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,889
losing weight again at about 5 pounds a

208
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,479
month and it looks like that's going to

209
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,039
be my weight loss rate with my current

210
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,889
exercise my current food regimen moving

211
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,900
forward so I should still hit my goal

212
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,819
probably within the next year of 270

213
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,560
pounds when I get down under 300 pounds

214
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,120
they're gonna remove a lot of this

215
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,740
excess skin which is gonna add more

216
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,030
weight loss and make it easier to

217
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,370
exercise and easier to do things and I'm

218
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,360
really looking forward to that that's

219
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
the next chapter so in about a year or

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,690
tune in and we'll show you the weight

221
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,889
loss removal will show you the skin

222
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,900
removal will show you how I've killed it

223
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,599
the good news is was I successful yes

224
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,240
beyond my hopes and wildest dreams if

225
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,440
you look back at some of those videos I

226
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,520
said I hope to lose a hundred pounds

227
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,569
from the surgery

228
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,819
I lost 180 it's almost 200 pounds it'll

229
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,889
be 200 pounds soon probably by the

230
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,199
beginning of fall I still got another 6

231
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,729
months to a year of this surgery being

232
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,130
very very effective for me and during

233
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,479
that period of time I plan to lose as

234
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,159
much weight as possible was I successful

235
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,659
as you might have wanted me to be

236
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,270
probably not am i successful as I wanted

237
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,639
to be probably not but considering the

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,500
circumstances I thought I was good as

239
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,669
destroyed all I thought would be putting

240
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,830
weight back on by now I thought I was

241
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,690
going to ruin everything

242
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,759
fortunately the surgery did what it was

243
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
supposed to do and kept me from doing

244
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,960
that as self-destructive as I could be

245
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,139
as self-destructive as I am I managed

246
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,300
not to self-destruct thumbs up for that

247
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,510
the good news is this is a year two of a

248
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,029
two-year procedure so let's start round

249
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,000
two and let's come out swinging
