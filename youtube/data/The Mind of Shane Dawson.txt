1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,429
[Music]

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,179
okay so I intended for this to be a

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,870
simple video about Shane Dawson but it

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,890
turned out to be wilder and crazier then

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,660
I could have ever imagined I don't even

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,770
know where to begin

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,340
[Music]

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,590
Hey Oh what are you doing here you you

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,000
told me to walk up on you and I dun

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,980
specified time so it felt like the shoot

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,780
was very spontaneous oh yeah

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,030
where we shouldn't attack

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,400
[Music]

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,160
you know or shootin yeah but you told me

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,390
to act like I didn't know what we were

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,980
shooting so that the shoot would seem

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,420
really spontaneous oh yeah yeah that's

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,010
right

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,430
[Music]

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,620
so we had originally planned on making

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,630
this video about something totally

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,130
different we were gonna make a video

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,080
about freshwater dolphins but oh my oh

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,040
my god

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,479
this is crazy I just got a text oh wait

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,180
never mind it's just my mom so so we've

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,950
all seen the videos that Shane Dawson

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,979
has made where he documents other

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,130
people's lives but don't you think it's

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,890
weird that no one has ever documented

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,770
his

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:50,830
[Music]

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,170
before we get too deep into this I do

34
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,730
have to mention we could not get the

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,850
rights to Shane Dawson's footage so

36
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,770
instead we'll be using dramatic

37
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,050
reenactments using a professional actor

38
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,970
to recreate footage from Shane's videos

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,090
so what is it that makes Shane Dawson

40
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,770
tick is it possible that with all that

41
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,400
he's done he could be a psychopath

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
because that changes everything

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
could he be bipolar I just want to give

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,280
you a chance to like tell her side of

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
the story

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,760
could he have IBS

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:39,100
and if so what does that mean it's the

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,330
heart

49
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,730
now I should say that I have no

50
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,920
professional experience to be throwing

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,650
these theories around but as long as I

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,660
pose it like a question I could keep

53
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,940
insinuating that he has any one of these

54
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,640
traits and handpicking examples to fit

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,680
my narrative now what if he did have IBS

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,070
irritable bowel syndrome well I've done

57
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,560
five minutes of research and here's a

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,090
clip of an expert talking about IBS IBS

59
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,260
makes you poop a lot oh my god it just

60
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,580
hit me oh my god what think about all

61
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,100
the jump cuts in his videos he really

62
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,810
goes longer than five seconds before

63
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,440
making another cut if he had IBS and had

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,239
to poop a lot maybe between every take

65
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,690
he's pooping oh my god I'm getting goose

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,370
bumps make sure the music is really

67
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,790
scary here

68
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:55,939
spooky so I feel like I don't know Shane

69
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,970
Dawson well enough and that's why I'm

70
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,489
going to talk with Courtney Miller she

71
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,950

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,240
spare time

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,680

78
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,030
more pressing issue is it possible that

79
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:34,430
Shane Dawson has IBS well my sister had

80
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,970
IBS and it really sucked like she was

81
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,220

85
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,020

86
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,430

hand it's shaking

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,450
we have to go straight to the source

90
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,580
we're gonna have to talk to Shane Dawson

91
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:27,450
my god she's man

92
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:37,010
we did it

93
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,230
so in order to set up a meeting with

94
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,960

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,200
his phone number so here we go Oh oh my

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,500

98
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,960
the same nothing I can't find it

99
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,610
anywhere it's almost like it doesn't

100
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,980
exist conspiracy

101
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,920
or it's just really hard to find no no

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,880

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
god this is so scary

104
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,760
make sure the music is really scary here

105
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,780
okay why does our camera make that noise

106
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,420
whenever you zoom in and out well this

107
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,750
noise yes yes god it sounds like you're

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,730
dragging a brick across concrete stop

109
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:32,980
doing that can you buy a better camera

110
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,690
we were getting desperate to find any

111
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,940
information we could on the whereabouts

112
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,340
of Shane Dawson excuse me do you know

113
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,830
where I could find Shane Dawson sorry do

114
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,840
you know where Shane Dawson lives excuse

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,750
me do you know Shane Dawson he makes

116
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,730
videos about Jake paul and Tana con he's

117
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,719
a youtuber what oh my

118
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,719
and that's when it hit me he never

119
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,939
actually showed up

120
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,039
Titanic on I didn't end up going to

121
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,610
tannic on his phone number didn't exist

122
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,979
I can't find it anywhere and no one knew

123
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,269
him outside of the internet what oh yeah

124
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,059
that leads us to one conclusion the only

125
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,869
logical conclusion about Shane Dawson

126
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:25,949
Shane Dawson doesn't just have IDs Shane

127
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:51,790
Dawson doesn't exist

128
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,350
so there you have it guys be sure to

129

thank you for joining us on this journey

134
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,569
inside the mind of Shane Dawson IBS is

135
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,639
no joke doctors recommend wearing

136
