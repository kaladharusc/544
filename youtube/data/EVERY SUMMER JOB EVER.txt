1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,800
All right, summer break means doing nothing but sitting back, relaxing,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,240
and my job at the Taco Bungalow starts tonight.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,940
I hate my life.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,620
(knocking)

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,860
Pizza delivery!

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,640
Hey man.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,220
Ugh. Finally!

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,160
Uh, that'll be $43.50.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,860
Ugh, where's my sauce?

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,000
Uh, I... wasn't given any sauce.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
I ordered sauce!

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,340
Uh...

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,300
Listen, man, if I didn't get any sauce, I can't give you any sauce. Are you sure you ordered it?

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,500
Ian Hecox: Why don't you have my sauce?!

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
I'm just the delivery guy, bro!

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,020
NO SAUCE,

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,440
YOU'RE LOSSSSSSS!!!

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,300
*SLAM*

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,460
Honestly, the nicest customer I've had all day.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,740
This is supposed to be my summer break, but I'm working!

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,640
Hi Lizzie! Thank you for coming on such short notice!

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,780
Your mother says you're a great babysitter.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,020
Yeah! Totally! Uh, where's the baby?

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,200
What the heck, mom, I don't need a babysitter!

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Wait, Taylor? From Algebra class?

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,120
Mom, you hired my classmate?!

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,840
Okay, well, once you prove you're responsible enough, then you can be home alone. Okay, bye!!

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,300
I'M SEVENTEEN YEARS! OLD I DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER!

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,780
My god.

31
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,060
(sigh)

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,700
Anyways, um, I pooped in my pants so...

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,520
Ugh, got a summer job tutoring kids in math.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,020
Be grateful!

35
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,240
Man, I can't find a summer job anywhere!

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,540
Have you found anything?

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,160
Actually, I got hired as a lifeguard at a retirement home.

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,420
I didn't know retirement homes had pools...

39
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,240
Oh, they don't.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,120
*SPLAT*

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,620
WOMAN DOWN! WE'VE GOT A WOMAN DOWN!

42
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,200
*TWEET*

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
HUFF, HUFF

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,260
NO! NO!

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,920
*Exhale*

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,620
UGH! LIVE, DAMMIT, LIVE!

47
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,220
Ugh, huuuh hahah

48
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,720
Huah

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,280
*Loud Breathing*

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,940
Broccoli cheddar day strikes again.

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,340
*BANG*

52
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,280
NOOOOOOOO!!!

53
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,940
How you doing on mac and cheese, Margaret? You need more?

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,620
Yeah.

55
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm a lifeguard at the local pool. Maybe you should drown some time.

56
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,100
Ooh! SAWEET! I love this job! I get to watch a ton of movies for free!

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,440
Alright first up is... that Dwayne &quot;the Rock&quot; Johnson movie where he's punching an earthquake!

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,940
*SLICE*

59
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,380
Perfect!

60
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,819
*Sentimental Music*

61
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:38,220
I've watched 5,000 Dwayne the Rock Johnson movies.

62
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,260
Somebody kill me.

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,240
My summer job is stripping!

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,420
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

65
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,160
Hey Dad?

66
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,040
Nancy and I want to open a lemonade stay in this summer.

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,260
Well, it's going to take a lot of hard work!

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,700
You'll have to build the stand yourself and... squeeze lemons all day!

69
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,420
Well okie dokie!

70
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,200
Hey dad,  Natalie and I want to open a lemonade stand!

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Well, it'll take a lot of hard work. First,

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,880
you'll have to apply for a business permit, then form an LLC, then hire a CPA...

73
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,160
[Utter confusion and nonsense]

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,560
Also, you'll need to squeeze lemons all day.

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,860
Yeah...

76
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,860
Nevermind.

77
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,640
Only 28.32 hours away from my Nikes!

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,860
Focus your strength, and you'll be finished in no time!

79
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,380
I'm learning karate, right? That's why you're not paying me?

80
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,580
Yeah...

81
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,800
(Totally)

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
Racist little bastard.

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,800
What?

84
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,760
What?

85
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,240
I've been a camp counselor at Camp Silly Huckus for 16 years!

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,940
*knock*

87
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,580
Hello!

88
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,420
Good afternoon, sir. We're selling candy bars for children in need!

89
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,920
Well, isn't that a noble cause.

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
*Pulls out sum moneh :D*

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,140
Here you go!

92
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,640
Oh, nice! We can almost get an Xbox now!

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
Hold on, I thought you said this was for kids in need!

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,440
Yeah, we're kids in need...

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,560
...of an Xbox

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,060
Here you go.

97
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,560
*TOSS*

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
*CATCH*

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,400
Don't have to have a summer job because my parents give me allowance!

100
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Guess what?!

101
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:27,320
While you all were being lazy bags of sh*t all summer, I worked my ass off ten hours a day and earned just enough money to buy this brand-new iPhone! BOOM!!

102
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
Wow.

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,640
Good for you dude!

104
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,700
Yeah, and since I didn't buy insurance for it, I was able to get this smoothie instead. So suck on tha-

105
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,800
ACHOO!

106

Every summer wasted ever.

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,680
I have a line!

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,180
[Laughter] Olivia Sui: Well you went along with it. I'm so confused.

114
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,760
Well, at least I still have my smoothie so-

I used to be in the movies!

118
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,020
Stop touching me, Agatha.

119
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,580

Well, it's gonna be a lot of hard work, slugger. I don't know why I said that.

128
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,180
Slugger!
