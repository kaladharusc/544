1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,060
oh hey Ana have you seen Heather around

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,100
yeah actually I just got finished taking

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,580
care of her you took care of her yeah I

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,440
mean she didn't give me much of a choice

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,719
did you know she's barely seen any of

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,039
the Simpsons so you got rid of her

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,750
Walter we can handle an episode without

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,510
Heather I mean you've seen The Simpsons

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,720
right yes

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:36,450
oh good The Simpsons is an animated show

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,790
that has been on the air for 30 seasons

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,010
it follows the American family The

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,260
Simpsons and the other residents of

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,450
Springfield starting in its second

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,190
season there have been annual Halloween

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,840
specials comprised of three short

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,550
stories they're a way for the writers to

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,899
play around with their characters

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,370
without having to answer to the show's

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,680
continuity these specials are known as

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,300
the tree houses of horror

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,760
these are the top five best treehouse of

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,589
horror episodes number 5 treehouse of

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,950
horror 13 fright to creep and scare

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,010
harms after Lisa successfully convinces

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,390
the citizens of Springfield to

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,460
relinquish their firearms some undead

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,290
villains take advantage of the recently

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,659
defenseless town the zombie Cowboys

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,759
rained terror upon the poor residents

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,560
and someone has to travel back in time

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,560
to fix their mistakes this is not the

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,689
first or even best zombie episode of The

34
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,549
Simpsons and leaves you with mixed

35
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,500
messages but the other stories in the

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,329
special were memorable enough to curve

37
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,330
its grade

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,140
island of dr. Hibbert the island of dr.

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,510
Moreau may seem like a heavy subject for

40
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,360
a family cartoon and it is this was a

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,550
properly disturbing retelling while the

42
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,110
Simpson family vacations in a mysterious

43
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,020
island some creepy animal hybrids start

44
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,240
popping up dr. Hibbert will not be

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,580
stopped and continues his unforgivable

46
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,460
experiments on the Simpson family this

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,380
segment sure stayed memorable thanks to

48
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,330
its disturbing visuals and although it's

49
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,730
dark for a regular episode it feels

50
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,470
right at home in a Halloween special

51
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,230
send in the clones in this parody of

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,540
multiplicity Homer buys a magic hammock

53
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,310
that duplicates himself for a while

54
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,590
having multiple homers is a benefit to

55
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,230
his loved ones and himself by taking his

56
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,960
less desirable duties eventually he

57
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,060
creates too many versions of himself to

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,160
control them and decides to abandon the

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,620
duplicates in a field with the hammock

60
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,230
of course the clones use this hammock to

61
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,940
replicate themselves to an absurd amount

62
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,550
they then devour entire farms with the

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,970
food and factories worth of beer a fun

64
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,130
hypothetical tale on why the world can

65
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,510
only handle one Omer at a time number

66
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,790

67
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,510
15 for beheadings and a funeral in this

68
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,250
Sherlockian episode The Simpsons

69
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,350
utilizes dark humour to tackle another

70
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,720
whodunit seeing The Simpsons characters

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,640
in other time periods is a clever way to

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,770
play with classic tropes it's hard for

73
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,510
any episode to live up to who shot mr.

74
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,850
burns but this story still has a couple

75
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,430
twists to keep you on your toes

76
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,700
Ned's own after an accident Ned Flanders

77
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,560
gains the ability to predict people's

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
deaths this distressing new power comes

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,269
at a cost he sees himself killing Homer

80
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,340
Simpson when Flanders tries to prevent

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,049
himself from committing this act he

82
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,299
realizes he must kill Homer to stop the

83
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,280
end of the world this episode features

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,530
this dying bit that still makes me

85
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,310
giggle to this day

86
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,270
[Music]

87
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:44,770
oh you stupid son of a-- belly of the

88
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,230
boss at a science convention maggie

89
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,090
climbs into a pill just before it

90
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,250
shrinks and is consumed by mr burns

91
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,230
after being shrunken themselves the

92
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,180
remaining simpson's go into his body to

93
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,400
retrieve the baby once inside the family

94
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,050
must locate the stomach before the

95
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,300
stomach acids dissolve her with maggie

96
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,070
on board they don't have enough power to

97
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,470
bring everyone back so one person must

98
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,420
stay behind this is when homer chooses

99
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,850
to stay behind and expands inside of mr.

100
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,610
burns starring me for life thankfully I

101
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,530
was immediately cured when they danced

102
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,390
to the most fitting song I've got you

103
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,340
under my skin a rollercoaster of an

104
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,600
episode with an unforgettable conclusion

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,990
number three treehouse of horror 7 the

106
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,570
genesis tub during a science experiment

107
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,260
with soda

108
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,050
Lisa accidentally creates life her tiny

109
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,480
tooth town evolves quickly but is

110
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,190
partially destroyed by Bart's

111
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,680
carelessness the civilization shrinks

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,390
Lisa to worship her as their God and

113
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,560
recruit her help

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,470
for revenge this tale is the weaker part

115
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,170
of this episode but I really enjoyed the

116
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,140
different animated angles citizen King

117
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,300
when Homer is abducted aliens Kang and

118
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,310
kodos demand to be taken to the leader

119
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,770
of Earth because Homer is American and

120
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,620
an American election is imminent they

121
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,780
have to get creative with taking over

122
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,810
the humans naturally they take over Bob

123
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,870
Dole and Bill Clinton's forms so that no

124
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,930
matter the outcome an alien will rule

125
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,270
their new forms are incredibly

126
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,520
suspicious but no one believes homers

127
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,030
wild claims until it is too late this

128
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,740
has some great political commentary

129
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,370
including this satirical gem we must

130
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,970
move forward not backward upward not

131
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,350
forward and always twirling twirling

132
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,990
twirling towards freedom

133
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,810
[Applause]

134
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,870
the thing and I when a mysterious noise

135
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,030
comes from the Attic the Simpson

136
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,800
children investigate letting loose

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,169
whatever was chained up there that

138
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,389
whatever was actually a hidden sibling

139
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,759
that looks like Bart they discover Hugo

140
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,400
was once Bart's conjoined twin but was

141
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,650
believed to be pure evil so they were

142
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,139
separated Hugo has been hell-bent on

143
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,240
returning to Bart side but when dr.

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,490
Hibbert realizes Bart is the real evil

145
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,680
twin the boys switch lives to have it

146
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,139
the way it always should have been this

147
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,669
is the best example of how these

148
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,319
Halloween specials can mess with

149
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,550
continuity in the best way

150
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,800
number two the treehouse of horror for

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,319
the devil and Homer

152
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,990
I have desperation and hunger Homer

153
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,569
sells his soul for a donut he out what's

154
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,280
the devil by not finishing his donut but

155
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,199
for obvious reasons that is short-lived

156
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,539
when he does consume the final bite he

157
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,699
is held in hell until the trial for his

158
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,710
soul the best part of this episode is

159
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,270
Homer being tortured by feeding him

160
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,430
donuts eternally if you know Homer

161
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,770
that's not even close to a bad thing the

162
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,240
most memorable details of this segment

163
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,430
are the cannibalistic donut Homer and

164
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,020
devil Flanders himself terror at five

165
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,360
and a half feet in this Twilight Zone

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,310
parody Bart discovers a monster on the

167
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,440
side of the bus unfortunately no one

168
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,750
else sees it or believes him after Bart

169
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,979
is able to fight the creature away

170
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,659
everyone realizes he was actually

171
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,639
telling the truth for once when he is

172
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,740
carted away in an ambulance however the

173
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,080
gremlin is far from taking care of this

174
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,180
segment is so true to the characters it

175
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,740
feels like it could have absolutely been

176
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,659
a regular episode if it weren't for that

177
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:20,770
whole ending thing Bart Simpson's

178
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,800
Dracula the Simpson family is invited to

179
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,020
mr. burns for a midni dinner which in no

180
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,719
way is suspicious Lisa stop being so

181
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,699
suspicious did everyone watch their

182
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,610
necks like mr. burns ass

183
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,930
Lisa and Bart go snooping around the

184
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,820
castle and discover a basement full of

185
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,010
coffins they find ample evidence that

186
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,200
mr. burns is a vampire but no one does

187
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,970
anything until bart is turned into a

188
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,980
vampire to stop the vampirism from

189
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,610
spreading

190
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,710
they must kill the head vampire Homer's

191
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,290
boss mr. burns this final story is full

192
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,210
of hilarious one-liners and works

193
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,330
perfect as the cap on a standout special

194
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,130
with plenty of quality stories to choose

195
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,200
from we had to get picky to keep this

196
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,230
list to only 5 while some stories shined

197
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,800
together

198
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,570
others were muddled by their companions

199
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:19,360
and barely missed our countdown

200
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,969
[Music]

201
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,120
and the number one best treehouse of

202
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,060
horror episode is treehouse of horror 5

203
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,760
the shinning the Simpson family takes

204
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,829
over a lodge for the winter when mr.

205
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:39,779
burns takes away all the beer and cable

206
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,029
Homer quickly descends into a homicidal

207
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,310
rage hilariously the warm glow of

208
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,290
television cures everything

209
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,540
this classic parody still holds up and

210
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,760
it's a great Cliff Notes version of the

211
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,190
original movie The Shining Shh you want

212
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,500
to get sued time and punishment in one

213
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,449
day Homer fixes the family toaster a

214
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:03,029
little too well turning it into a time

215
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,370
machine he knows not to alter anything

216
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,199
in the past or else it will have dire

217
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,510
consequences in the future of course

218
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,209
Homer can't help himself he irreparably

219
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,339
changes the future to a world where Ned

220
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,920
Flanders is master of the world and

221
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,440
anyone who questions his leadership must

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,699
be lobotomised

223
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:22,980
so Homer must continuously travel back

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,500
in time to undo his original mistake

225
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,690
it's delightful to watch all the

226
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,640
different timelines Homer creates and

227
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,060
his inevitable miscalculations nightmare

228
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,610
cafeteria at the Springfield Elementary

229
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,040
School food is scarce and misbehaving

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,440
children are plentiful Principal Skinner

231
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,930
realizes that each problem is the other

232
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,170
solution a student start to disappear

233
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,880
Lisa and Bart go looking for answers

234
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,600
only to find the worst the faculty have

235
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,690
been caging and eating the students this

236
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,449
episode is one of the darkest and has

237
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:03,000
three solid parts that all hold their

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,420
weight

239
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,390
hence the coveted top spot it even wraps

240
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,649
up with a musical number

241
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,390

242
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,569
