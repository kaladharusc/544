26
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,500
with eggs I think it start off innocent

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,569
enough with a little Kinder Surprise egg

28
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,429
and then it became oh let's open this

29
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,439
slightly bigger Kinder Surprise egg oh

30
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,810

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,329
egg today we have a giant joy surprise

34
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:27,780
day as you can tell they take some

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,549
liberties on defining what exactly an

36
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,980
egg is an egg could be a capsule it

37
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,310
could be a sphere it could be a barrel

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,590
even a pair if it's any of those shapes

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,970
it checks out because they really don't

40
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,799
have any edges on them right if you give

41
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,780
a kid a box you know what's gonna happen

42
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,239
they're gonna die that's why it's got to

43
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,959
be an egg shape what do you do if you

44
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,450
don't have a giant surprise egg well

45
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,700
that's an easy one you put playdough on

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,160
an exercise ball and that's basically

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,989
the same shit mega huge spongebob well

48
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,099
how are you gonna get all the shit

49
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,230
that's in the exercise ball well you're

50
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,209
not because nothing's in the exercise

51
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,060
ball you put the neat little toys in the

52
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,819
in the eyes of Spongebob in the beak of

53
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,769
the Angry Bird and then you just dig

54
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,180
those out because that's that's a

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,190
fucking good video yeah

56
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,280
hey I do feel bad for a lot of kids

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,320
because in many cases they just follow

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,270
the orders of the parents they have some

59
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,980
weird loose script that they go with and

60
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,230
the mom says say that you're excited and

61
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,180
then pull out the toy you can tell in

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,350
these series of clips that I'm about to

63
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,120

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:45,980
excited to I want to fucking kill myself

65
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,510

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,970
