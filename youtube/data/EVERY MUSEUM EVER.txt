1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,200
Keith: What the hell is this?
Courtney: I'm just gonna put my hand on my chin so I look sophisticated.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,540
Ian (THINKING): This looks like crap, but I care too much about my image to say that.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,360
Olivia (THINKING):  I have to s**t

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,900
Noah (THINKING): I Can't believe they actually like my art piece. I found it in a dumpster behind a kindergarten.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,980
Every Museum Ever

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,940
Olivia: Baby, you know this is my ideal date. It's just like that movie, 500 days of summer.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,480
Keith: Oh babe, let's take a picture with this blob thing.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,960
Olivia: Let's leave now. 
Keith: Babe, we're so cultured.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,880
Olvia: Oh my god like yogurt.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,700
Every

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,820
(snore)

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,800
Ever

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,500
Olivia: Okay, I think I'm ready to leave.
Ian: Yeah

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,580
Ian: Um... Where's the exit? 
Olivia: Oh right there!

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:03,000
Ian: Oh, ah, No, I think that's vintage revival art. 
Olivia: Oh, okay. I think you're right. Let's grab a map.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,940
Ian: Wait no this is a map installation, I think.
Olivia: oh okay, all right, let's ask that security guard.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,580
Ian: No, no this is performance art.

18
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:22,420
Security Guard: No, I'm the security guard. I get this all the time. The exit is that way.

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:29,560
*Claps*
Ian: Wow he's really good.
Olivia: Are we supposed to tip him?
Security: Yes!

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,640
Surrealism!

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,540
Pointillism!

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,620
Capitalism!

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,400
Cubism! Those are arts.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,320
Guide: Moving on to one of my favorite pieces,

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,380
This is Edvard Munch's &quot;The Scream&quot;. Now, Munch often depicted deeply traumatic

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,260
events in his own life, on to the painting. You see this

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,540
sexless twisted fetal face creature, with his eyes and mouth wide open in terror.

28
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,500
Captures a moment in which Munch said the air turned to blood.

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,620
What do you guys think about that?

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,860
*Camera snap*

31
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,800
Dammiiiiiiiit

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,060
That looks like a pee-pee. Yeah...

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,020
Courtney: Oh, Let's check out the special exhibit. 
Olivia: Yeah!!

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,180
Employee: Um, excuse me ladies. Only one person into the special exhibit at a time.
Olivia: I'll go first.

35
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,520
Employee: I'm sorry, but you have to buy a special ticket for this exhibit.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,940
Courtney: Okay, we'll take two.
Employee: You can only buy them online.

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,240
Olivia: Oh i'll buy them on my pho-  
Employee: six months in advance

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,220
Courtney: What's even in there? Is it worth it? 
Employee: Oh, the art. Isn't worth it, but the feeling of exclusivity is.

39
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,280
Olivia: See you in six months! 
Employee: Wait hold on... and it is sold out.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,020
Both: Damn iiiiiiiit

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,860
I drew a line on a large canvas.

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,840
ohh! i'll buy it for 50 million dollars!

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,420
Audio Guide: &quot;The kiss&quot; was painted by Austrian Symbolist painter, Gustave Klimt. Between 1907 and 1908.

44
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,100
The couple's embrace, often makes me think of my ex-wife Leslie,

45
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,040
because this was her favourite piece of artwork.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,220
And I begged her to let me embrace her, but she insisted that my touches made her sick!

47
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:20,400
Now, we'll continue on to 77 more pieces that remind me of my ex-wife.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
Courtney: I think we're on the wrong tour.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,220
*Sobbing*

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,680
Noah: Why would Leslie treat him like that.

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,380
Courtney: I-- I can't hear you.

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,220
I dare you to touch it

53
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,808
Kieth:See anything?

54
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,320
Ian: No, it's weird, right?

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,080
Uhh... Excuse me. What kind of art, do you have in this museum?

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,100
Receptionist: Oh! We don't actually have any arts at this museum

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,660
It's a bunch of colorful backdrop for your Instagram photos.

58
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,160
Keith: Oh, Well, I guess I could use a little extra color on my Instagram. How much is it?

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,640
Receptionist: $300 Dollars.
Ian: For two tickets?!

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Receptionist: Oh no, that's for one ticket. Hmm... two tickets would be...

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,020
$900 Dollars.

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,680
Both: Damn iiiiiiiiiittt.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Every museum ever
