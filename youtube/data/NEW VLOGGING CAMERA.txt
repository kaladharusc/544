00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,649
my normal commute to the office but the streets are closed hours of a million

10
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:02,850

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,870
I'm talking about here though but before I do there's one thing i want to quickly

18
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,850

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,370

22
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:56,670
this is a product review as you regular viewers know my go to blogging camera is

23
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,960
a canon SLR camera on the end of this baby thing with a microphone in the top

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,950
the canon 70d has been my go-to for a very long time

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,720
it's stable it works it's fairly lightweight I've been very happy with

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,040
this camera then a few months ago can announces its successor the atd terrible

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,580
name

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,330
aaadd three times as a DD a DD a DD and I was the first person on planet earth

29
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,519
to get an early version of the a.d.d sent to me by two friends at BHT restore

30
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,160
and kam camera store both great stores

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,959
check them out now this thing was supposed to be better than the old one

32
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,940
in every way and i can tell you after working with it for like a month now

33
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,540
beating the hell out of it using it day in and day out

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,130
it is not

35
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,400
the focus works better and it takes a better picture but this thing's have

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,230
very serious reliability issues like major like this past week of it

37
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,710
do you see that i have recorded it go but now its back on

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,790
it just did it i have recorded flickers on it flickers office workers aren't

39
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,330
flippers off happens to me like at least once or twice a day

40
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,640
never happen with this thing on top of that I've had made her audio issues with

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,110
the cannon a TD across two different microphones the same microphones I used

42
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,870
with the old one and never had

43
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:26,730
so today I announce i am retiring my new canon a TD and I'm taking out of

44
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:34,530
retirement my old canon 70d everything old is new again and through whatever

45
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,280

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,730
pro tip here you take a piece of scotch tape and you carefully and you carefully

48
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,480
make a little pull tab here for the screen then when you've got the boosted

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,170
word controller in one hand and the camera on the other hand but you need to

50
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,050
flip the screen around you just pull it around with your teeth

51
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,050
it makes things a lot easier
