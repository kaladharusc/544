1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,859
it is exactly 11 hours after the first

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,300
shots were taken by that mass murderer

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,960
by the terrorists in Las Vegas Nevada

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,250
now when I woke up this morning and I

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,780
learned of this attack I went through

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,000
this kind of range of emotions that's

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,570
not that's not really unfamiliar but it

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,670
starts with being really angry like I

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,260
wanted like I want to do something like

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,019
I want to catch this mother and then

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,090
that anger slowly turns to grief where I

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,030
just feel terrible for the victims and

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,570
the victim's family and then it usually

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,110
settles down by like right now in the

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,309
emotion that I feel now is one of

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,739
helplessness help us because I'm just

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,450
one person and I don't know what I could

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,090
do and when considering what resources I

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,700
have that could help people I think the

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,829
greatest resource is this YouTube

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,160
channel and and you this audience and an

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,570
audience that I called out in the past

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,960
and that has been incredibly generous

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,730
anytime I've ever asked anything I'm

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,700
starting a GoFundMe a fundraiser and I

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,439
want to raise as much money as possible

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,830
and I want to give that money to the

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,780
families of the victims the victims

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,900
themselves the survivors the people

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,259
directly affected in a physical way from

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,430
this just horrific attack and I say with

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,220
with full respect and appreciation for

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,560
the fact that money will will not bring

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,490
back the lives that have been lost money

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,759
won't won't heal somebody's wounds

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
money won't solve the anguish in the

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
sadness and and everything that's being

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,350
felt by the people and the families of

39
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,229
those victims money can't fix any of

40
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,509
that but maybe maybe a little bit of

41
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,009
money can help someone with medical

42
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,840
bills maybe a child who lost their

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,610
parent maybe they could buy some new

44
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,479
toys and be distracted for an hour maybe

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,829
money can buy a family a a meal they can

46
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,079
go out to dinner and they can talk about

47
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,770
things I don't know but this was the

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,360
only form of action that I could think

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,340
of

50
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,920
and I know that in times of grief it's

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,390
not a time when you want to be thinking

52
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,400
about earning or thinking about finances

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
or thinking about any of that stuff so

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,230
money could be helpful there too

55
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,020
now logistically there's a lot of

56
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,480
unanswered questions here I will tell

57
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,790
you that I will personally make sure

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,580
that none of this money is given to a

59
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,890
charity or a nonprofit that will take

60
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,099
the fee from it or anything like that I

61
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,050
will work with individuals I'll work

62
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,610
with people I'll work with organizations

63
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,680
that will help me figure out how to get

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,410
this money the money that we pulled

65
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,269
together directly into the hands of

66
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,989
people no middlemen taking a cut nothing

67
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:54,620
like that

68
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,540
this video you're watching right now is

69
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,580
monetized I put an ad at the beginning

70
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,620
in and out at the end so all of the

71
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,090
Adsense revenue from this video will

72
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,150
also be donated and all the pragmatic

73
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,819
stuff all that will be updated on the

74
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,130
GoFundMe page I think the important

75
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,370
thing is to harness how I'm feeling now

76
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,019
and how I imagine others are feeling

77
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,030
right now which is this desire to do

78
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,940
something and if giving five dollars if

79
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,000
giving ten dollars means that somebody

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,430
on the other end who is dealing with

81
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,040
this can do something positive with that

82
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,569
then that's an action and that's

83
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,209
something I want to end this by saying

84
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,620
that it shocks me that any one person is

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,709
capable of being that evil and the shock

86
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,540
that I feel must be nothing compared to

87
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,810
the shock that the people actually

88
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,880
personally affected by that evil must be

89
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,079
feeling so this campaign should be a way

90
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,060
of showing those people that there

91
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,579
there's a lot of good out there there's

92
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,470
a lot of good people out there and our

93
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,100
desire our capacity to help maybe can

94
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,889
mitigate some of what's being felt by by

95
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,130
by this this evil-doers capacity to to

96
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:19,720
to commit evil

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:40,000
you
