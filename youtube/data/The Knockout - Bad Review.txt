1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,800
hey guys it's me Destin welcome back to

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,540
smarter every day today we're gonna

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,670
learn how a kangaroo goes it going just

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,980
goes into a kangaroo's pouch hey

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,959
everybody welcome back today we're gonna

6
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,089
do a brand new series this one's called

7
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,610
bad review by the way this is not a paid

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,020
promotion I just wanna make that clear

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,660
because by my setup here it kind of

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,520
makes it look to other people like I'm a

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,710
very professional guy who gets paid lots

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,870
of money to promote things but in fact

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,320
that's not the case just because it's a

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,970
bad habit I'll do the money shot but

15
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,739
this is a review we're doing a review

16
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,530
today my momma my money review it's the

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,839
same fucking wig that Misaki sent me oh

18
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,850
hell yeah it's a cool wig dude very

19
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,999
realistic as my real head of it okay so

20
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,190
apparently the way this product works is

21
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,769
oh okay cool dude I told the knockout

22
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:50,780
boys in the email that I don't drink and

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,670
I don't smoke so they're like ah yeah

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,260
don't worry about a man you just unbox

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,839
it man it'll be cool I'm like ah dude

26
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:59,719
but yeah it's a knockout man you don't

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,449
want to see me do the knockout challenge

28
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,009
all right guys I think this is a pretty

29
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:08,990
good product that's gonna do it for this

30
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,799
episode of bad review all right let's

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,810
get this party started boys one of the

32
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,240
obvious main advantages of the knockout

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,399
is that it's it's a bottle opener to

34
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:22,610
probably that face when literally

35
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,560
anything can be used as a bottle opener

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,149
if you use it correctly hey bro you want

37
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,570
a beer

38
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:39,409
oh fuck yeah man you go bro to do the

39
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,310
shit on my beer

40
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,140
are you talking about man is Corona a

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,500
shit beer whatever man

42
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,720
suit yourself

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
I don't think I'm ready to do any of

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,710
this quite yet I need to get a little

45
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,930
bit of inspiration and what better place

46
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,390
to get inspiration than the knockout

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,610
promo video it worked by letting air

48
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,900
flow into the bottle through the

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,670
stainless steel tube so the beer flows

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,590
out smoothly oh man look at that air

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,540
flow seems like air flow is a really

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,620
important thing when you're drinking

53
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,110
beer and doing Bond stuff it works by

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,760
letting air flow into the bottle through

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,410
the stainless steel tube so the beer

56
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,460
flows out smoothly just to seal the

57
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,230
knock out onto any bottle and you can

58
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,300
chug smoothly without spilling a drop oh

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,130
yeah I hate when it doesn't go down

60
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,410
smooth and it's all like choppy and like

61
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,000
going down your throat weird ways of

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,770
life my beer drinking experience is

63
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:39,420
totally ruined Obama if only there was a

64
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,070
big nipple on the end of it that I could

65
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,320
suck on like a t on the end of the

66
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
stainless steel tube there's a 1 year to

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,660
Bowl

68
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,030
packing your herbs fill a bottle halfway

69
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,680
and you've got yourself a portable water

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,690
bomb pothead or not you gotta love

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,700
packing herb packing herb in your bowl

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,250
smoosh the herb into the pack tube until

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,080
you get a nice herb pack it's gonna

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,570
revolutionize your party do a knock out

75
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,090
it's the fucking demon spawn of a beer

76
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,319
bong and a gravity bar

77
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:16,829
I think they're supposed to be a little

78
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,840
filter front but that shit didn't work I

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,060
got a little piece of herb hitting my

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,890
throat you gotta remember to pack your

81
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,689
herb herb alright guys we're gonna

82
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,250
change gears a little bit here and we're

83
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,260
gonna go with a bit of a gravity bomb I

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,030
don't know if this is how this works but

85
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,829
I'm calling a gravity bomb because

86
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,810
gravity is gonna happen let's start

87
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,730
cooking the weed now I see smoke filling

88
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,730
the chamber if your milk boy like me you

89
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,260
can use it on your milk one of the great

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,750
things about the knockout is you can use

91
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,790
it with just about any product that

92
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,269
comes in in a bottle

93
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,480
or what do you faggot do how you would a

94
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,659
gravity bomb bomb you just light it and

95
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,159
you toke that was severely ineffective

96
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,810
all right guys there not only did one

97
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,489
knockout so what we're gonna finish off

98
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,530
with one final one I got a lot of liquid

99
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,169
in my tummy right now go do one one last

100
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,090
one you don't want to have to remember

101
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,159
to pack your herb before you get started

102
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,340
so you do really good knock out that

103
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,699
face when my name a cunt

104
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,360
it's disgusting fucking foul yo this

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,550
tastes like tastes a lot like oregano if

106
