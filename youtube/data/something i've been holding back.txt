these heat guns are really good for

drying clothes and reheating food and

36
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,590

strip paint which of their intended

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,750

of trying to dry your hair with one of

40
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:56,590
these because they will melt your hair

excuse me I met you in Nashville a

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,340
couple weeks ago it's the kid that was

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,080
in the video from Tennessee that I was

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,580
skateboarding with just a to the other

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,170
side of town now I met a kid named

46
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,850
Austin what's up Austin Austin

47
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,260
it was awesome to meet you in Nashville

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,140
thank you for the snow globe and I liked

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,360
the Confederate flag was appropriated

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,430
with stars in there ah real talk

51
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,260
I don't know if you can tell but like

52
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,300
I've been a little distracted lately

53
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,820
extremely distracted lately I try as

54
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,790
hard as I tend to hide that like from

55
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,800
the vlog I don't try to hide it because

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
there's stuff I don't want you to know I

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,100
try to hide it because because I'm not

58
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,570
at a place of it because there are

59
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,670
things that are happening right now but

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,830
they're not quite ready to share with

61
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,840
the universe with you and that makes me

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,630
feel bad so much of this so much of this

63
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,880
vlog is predicated on honesty and like

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,739
me being open and transparent with

65
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,000
what's going on in my life in my career

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,980
with you the audience and I'm definitely

67
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,500
withholding information right now I'll

68
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,760
be in a place where I can share very

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,220
very soon but there's a lot going on and

70
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,920
it's like a big sort of turn like a

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,310
pivot or like an inflection point in my

72
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,800
personal life and my career in my family

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,110
life it's wonderful and it's positive

74
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,359
but it's weighing your on me and it's

75
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,340
like all I'm thinking about and the fact

76
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,890
that I can't like sort of vent to my

77
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,320
therapist / YouTube audience when we

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,330
sort of promotes that frustration so

79
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,710
yeah I don't mean to sort of bring

80
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,920
things down here I just wanted to

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,020
share with share with you a little bit

82
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,130
of like what's going on with me right

83
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,420
now

84
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,910
that's all that's all like regular vlogs

85
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,160
everything's staying the same nothing's

86
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
changing everything's changing nothing's

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,180

minivan or some sort of weird vehicle

92
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,030
I brought my boosted board with me and

93
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,730

other options Herman when I said who's

135
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,310
worse at planning me or Candice I am

136
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,680
we're at the wrong Airport and there's

137

only one flight out of New York City

138

that planning you or me but it's

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,860
definitely me yeah

143
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,910
so we're kind of screwed we can't do

144
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,520
anything good to go home now we're gonna

145
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,720
go to the other Airport now we're back

146
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,280
in the car missed our flight we missed

147
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,450
the other flight when it's on you're a

148
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,260
different flight from a different

149
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,940
Airport you know you guys always give me

150
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,980
a hard time say I always pretend that

151
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,570
I'm rushing and I pretend I'm gonna miss

152
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,280
the flight

153
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,720
sometimes we actually doing that you

154
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,350
dumb computer answering stupid mother

155
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,250
Jeanne agent you have coming up for

156
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:01,740
three people two adults one mmm just to

157
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,780
reiterate exactly what's going on here

158
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,939
we went to the wrong

159
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,849
we flew to the wrong Airport our flight

160
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:22,739
was a bit it's not funny it's entirely

161
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,149
my fault but we went to the wrong

162
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,629
Airport so there are no flights out of

163
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,759
this Airport so now we're going to the

164
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,009
other Airport where we see there are a

165
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,389
couple of flights but we don't have any

166
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,639
tickets because it's like too soon so

167
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,139
we're just gonna go to the airport show

168
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,970
up there and just get out whatever a

169
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,769
flight that I have that'll get us there

170
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,590
or we'll go somewhere different

171
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,170
the choices are this figure out how to

172
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,690
go tonight to go in the morning or we

173
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,740
don't go at all what do you think

174
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,750
Bernsen come here I thought a night

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,700
thing for the one for one second that

176
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,560
she could fall asleep on our side say do

177
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,050
it we're gonna get there at 11:30 which

178
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,930
is 12:30 our time you just thrown in the

179
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,210
towel you know I'm just folding the

180
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,589
towel so we can open it up again

181
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,150

182
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,750
wanna go tomorrow all right it's a long

183
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,220
weekend in New York City if we don't go

184
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,890
I could still make it to my dinner with

185
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,640
my friends you and your ulterior motives

186

I'm coming Francine this was nothing

188
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,200
more than I was thinking a helicopter

189
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
ride the airport and then taking a ride

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,400
home which is fun

191
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,080
one time I was responsible for getting

192
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,360
five people on an international flight

193
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,029
to Italy and I was driving and we all

194
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:49,190
missed the play

195
00:10:49,190 --> 00:11:14,340

198
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,080

199
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,280
those looking funnel just like a family

200
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,080
trip to the airport you don't think

201

her friend Marcy having dinner

205
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,100
everything's cool you know the only

206
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,810
thing about tonight that was a failure

207
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,639
is that we didn't make our flight it was

208
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,680
a great night we have to ride in a

209
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,329
helicopter spending time together as a

210
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,850

211
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,490
