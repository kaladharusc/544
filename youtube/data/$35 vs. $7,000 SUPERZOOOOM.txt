1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,780
what's up making movies well yeah what

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,719
y'all doing make it move

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,389
I got a void that needs filling and some

4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,309
time to kill why don't you move me a key

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,349
go by and I'll cover the bit cuz you

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,050
know I spent money I don't have and if I

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,669
was throw me all the French's I don't

8
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:24,830
grab but the water on the way down

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,890
I don't contribute day 1 when you would

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,710
say myself ok

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:40,630
early morning bagel run

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,150
I've got some kind of kind of bad news

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,580
about 368 I mean sighs it's not that big

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,860
of a deal but it just kind of sucks see

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,810
construction was supposed to start today

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,210
with like contractors and construction

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,610
workers and plans and architects and all

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,890
that stuff but I just found out last

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,080
night that um there's like an issue with

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,420
our insurance so we had to delay by like

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,580
maybe a week maybe up to ten days I

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,320
guess it's not that big of a deal it

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,140
just kind of sucks but here at 368 we do

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,310
things by the books we don't take

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,960
chances we follow the rules now I have

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,090
always said that the gear doesn't matter

27
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,890
when it comes to telling stories making

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,170
videos YouTube and everything in between

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,880
the story you tell is always more

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,479
important than what you used to tell it

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,930
steven soderbergh

32
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,760
big like Hollywood movie director he's

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,650
the guy who directed Ocean's eleven and

34
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,479
like 20 other huge movies he shot his

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,130
latest feature film like a proper

36
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,109
thriller movie theater horror movie

37
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:46,710
he shot a lot of cell phone and he's

38
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,329
famously said that the future of

39
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,990
filmmaking is on cell phones and that's

40
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,369
the vision I really subscribe to so I

41
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,209
think it's something that that's

42
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,459
accessible to all of us and it's also a

43
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,619
very good segue to a new segment that's

44
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,990
going to come to you every Tuesday here

45
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,880
on three six eight called tech review

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,610
Tuesday Dan roll your new sweet intro

47
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,549
Casey asked me to make some sort of a

48
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,590
kick-ass intro phrase tech Tuesday

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,030
segment but I completely forgot I'm not

50
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,440
really worried there because he's not

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,450
gonna see this until this video goes

52
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,329
alive next week's tech Tuesday intro

53
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,459
sequence will be sick I promise

54
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,200
hope you guys like that intro Dan's been

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,209
working on it all week long all right

56
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,549
now on Facebook I've been seeing this

57
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,470
video pop up like had a really annoying

58
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,629
video you notice for this hyper zoom

59
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:49,080
lens that you can put on your cell phone

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:59,069
[Music]

61
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,170
and watching that just like there's no

62
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,019
teen way that thing works so I went

63
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:14,129
ahead and ordered one record of a better

64
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:14,730
world

65
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:25,409
together with you a lot of stuff in this

66
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,510
box I got this whole kit off of Amazon

67
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,700
for thirty-five dollars and 49 cents

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,829
maybe that's why I'm so skeptical of it

69
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:43,870
okay back to the unboxing

70
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,970
[Music]

71
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,610
at 35 bucks I just don't trust that if

72
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,159
you have to do what they say it's gonna

73
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,340
be able to do but I maintain open mind

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,250
[Music]

75
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,810
made it up before I'm giving me the

76
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,670
dishes water and the cup don't get too

77
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,959
much for this bins and there's two

78
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,670
people around me acquaintances to the

79
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,620
game and I'm enjoying someone chuck is

80
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,480
over to a good man I'm enjoying

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,310
someone's kids out which way to grin

82
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,470
I mean it's a chilling April day Sam

83
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,010
it's a little dramatic draw goggles face

84
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,569
faster

85
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,849
I need someplace like cinematic I think

86
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:41,349
in the far into this pier so this goes

87
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,139
on to here presumably like centered

88
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,529
perfectly okay and now this just kind of

89
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,649
screws on that on there oh and then one

90
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,209
of those is an adapter maybe make it

91
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,789
wider dude I can't believe you actually

92
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,709
fell for like one of those Facebook ads

93
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,209
like you see them all the time you're

94
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,589
like that's just garbage it's like it's

95
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:04,149
the new as-seen-on-tv thing but yeah you

96
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:07,209
actually bought it and dude if you

97
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,399
actually get this centered properly I

98
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,009
let's test it all right so this you be a

99
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,110
side-by-side comparison of the $35

100
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,939
Facebook infomercial lens on a cell

101
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,899
phone in a $1000 super zoom lens on a TV

102
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,600
$700 Canon camera body

[Music]

106
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,090
well color me impressed it's not a total

107
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,160
piece of for 35 bucks

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,550
as like sort of a gag but it it actually

109
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,870
works that's the thing that you put it

110
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,270
on and you can get what is a 20x zoom on

111
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,940
here 18 X zoom shot diversity is wildly

112
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,410
underrated when it comes to making

113
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,390
YouTube videos and having a long lens is

114
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,040
important and if all you have is a cell

115
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,420
phone this could prove helpful so I very

116
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,270
gently very reluctantly recommend this

117
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,550
total piece of thirty-five dollar lens

118
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,280
because it sort of almost works

119
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,330
[Music]

120
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,920
now we have a fun family activity

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,290
planned for the afternoon I got a food

122
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,210
that needs fell into some time to kill

123
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,920
why don't you move me a key go by and

124
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
I'll cover the bit cuz you know I'm

125
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,370
gonna spend the money I don't have

126
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,290
and if almost throw me all that branches

127
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,540
I don't grab put the water in the bottom

128
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,030
boil go ahead at the bottom and I'll

129
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,520
float to the top bar right crystal

130
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,140
commercial Liberty Science Center it's

131
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,150
like a Children's Museum the trick to

132
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,040
this place is you come about two hours

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
before closing that way no one else is

134
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,930
here Brandon what do I need to show my

135
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,540

136
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,840
daughter

137
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,660
three three yeah she definitely needs to

138
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,360
keep playing with the Train okay I would

139
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,890
take her downstairs to the third floor

140
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,280
go to eat erbium that's our miniature

141
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,830
zoom and if she's over 42 inches you

142
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,240
could definitely go on your penny come

143
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,330
over here all right thank you you're

144

who gave me two it could be you it could

146
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,250
be someone else you could put it on

147
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,590
yours or put it on the shelf I could go

148
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,630
it alone or I could use some help I

149
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,520
could bring you home or I could bring

150
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,770
myself and if

151
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,569
me to go I'll probably listen to you

152
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,520
find myself all by myself again with

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:18,479

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,990
edits are the best thing we've ever done

the best thing

168
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,870
work we've ever done

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,910

170
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,130
