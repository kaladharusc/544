a version of Bullet Bill that doesn't

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,489
have arms I don't think that's a

62
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,130
separate thing super cool it's flying by

63
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,959

66
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,670

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,739
last episode or the one before that he

68
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,350

69
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,060
little cat that comes out and paws the

70
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,070
coin pulls it back in but this time he

71
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,560

72
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,850

76
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,500
Mario's Kart you're really outdoing

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,040
yourself mister mm-my Mogu shan warden i

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,410
think maybe to the average unboxer you

79
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,270
might think that oh what a hassle to

80
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,640
have to deal with battery-operated shit

81
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,340
but let me tell you what it's a lot more

82
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,200
entertaining if you can play with shit

83
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
this battery operated rather than

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,520
playing with a fucking kazoo or sports

85
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,639
on a fucking 9-volt battery why in the

86
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,489
world would you make this three triple

87
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,460
A's in this 9-volt that doesn't make any

88
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,350
fucking sense have them all the same

89
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,290
thing all triple A's are both nine volts

90
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,970
I really don't like this mixing and

91
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,000
matching shit you're lucky that I have

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,820
nine volts you fucking gay you are a

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,500
piece of shit wow that's that's

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,090
innovative do you really need this shit

95
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,169
as the antenna

96
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,880
I feel like technology has improved

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,090
enough or you don't need this massive

98
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,060
string hanging off of the unit does it

99
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,910

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,850
mushroom DNA is more closely related to

107
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,390
humans than plants mushroom tip of the

108
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,390

113
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,900
this is a bit disappointing right

114
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,539
because this is a two-player game but I

115
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,010
just thought of a way you can actually

116
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,789
make it a single-player game see you can

117
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,070
