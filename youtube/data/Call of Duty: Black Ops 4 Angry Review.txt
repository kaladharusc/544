1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,620
oh my god what am I gonna do I actually

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,680
like Call of Duty this year but it's

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,469
Call of Duty how can I even let that

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,730
come out of my mouth

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,350
well what would people say do it Joe

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,140
do it who cares about single-player

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,039
games anymore

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,439
or giving you blacked out and you love

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,019
back out don't you John it's true I do

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,810
love blackout I think it's the best most

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,330
polished battle royale mode it easily

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,520
Trump's the closest competitor pub Jean

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,850
no Joe don't forget that they dropped a

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,820
single player nearly 33% of the value of

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,219
the game it's now just completely gone

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,710
yeah wait a minute that's some fucked up

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,500
shit but this is certainly the best Call

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,180
of Duty you played it in a while right

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,789
Joe well yeah that's also true of hell I

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,680
don't think I've liked a Call of Duty

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,480
more than this it's like water over it

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,210
too but Joe listen don't forget they're

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,969
actually selling locked day zero disc

24
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,930
content the season pass it costs fucking

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,549
$50 nearly the price of a whole nother

26
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,380
game and what do you get you get a

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,900
zombie map and mode and additional

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,880
characters that's done available right

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,070
now on that distance you already paid

30
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,000
for that's fucked up give it no don't do

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,500
it don't do it

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,140
you can't possibly support Activision in

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,259
this trash Joe yeah don't do it shut up

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,720
shut up over there check her fucking

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,509
mouth shut up Joe don't listen to him no

36
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:44,770
please don't this Gillan

37
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,390
[Music]

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:57,150
[Music]

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,470
so this is the best Call of Duty game in

40
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,100
recent memory I love its gunplay I love

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,090
its gameplay but I just cannot support

42
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,940
it at $60 so I hundred percent agree

43
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,670
with that completely agree with you it's

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,030
a 60 log game or a forty dollar game

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,090
being marketed as a $60 game and they

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,070
just removed a lot more than they put

47
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,260
back into it right an Activision thinks

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,050
they can get credit for throwing in this

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,530
messily jumbled together of specialists

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,320
HQ in place of a story mode which

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,180
they've ripped out of the game and then

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,070
also of course the battle royale mode

53
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,860
and then everybody applauds them as if

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,540
this is something that's this huge

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,840
innovation and and and grayton oh

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,450
they're agile I've seen reviewers saying

57
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,970
shut the fuck up are you kidding me

58
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,760
they're literally copying battle royale

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,970
because it is a fad now let's also be

60
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,220
honest here on my opinion of the

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,160
blackout mode is it is the best battle

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,410
royale mode that I played it is highly

63
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,330
polished combined with the Call of Duty

64
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:18,270
gameplay it's extremely addicting no no

65
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,510
don't show me your back heel you know

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,709
fuck yes yes yes beer dated beer dated

67
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,500
short beard for the win it's my first

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,170
real battle royale I played a little bit

69
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,060
of pubsey and a tiny bit of for tonight

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,410
so I think for tonight something a

71
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,730
little different with this building

72
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,830
mechanics I think this competes more

73
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,580
directly with pub G and for my money

74
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,610
blackout is better than pub G C I play

75
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,830
pump G but at this price point I would

76
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,840
still continue playing pub G if the

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,310
price was lower than yeah I 100% like

78
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,840
black black out some way better the

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,940
graphics are better the vehicles it just

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,310
feels like you said polished right it

81
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,280
feels polished the the the graphics you

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,470
know graphics in Call of Duty this

83
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,359
engine has been going on forever they

84
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,480
really have not been

85
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,000
upgrading this engine but it does look

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,510
good in terms of the color palette a lot

87
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,549
of military shooters nowadays are going

88
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,519
monotone very muted colors I like the

89
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,380
fact that it's bright it's easy on my

90
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,080
eyes to look at and I really do enjoy

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,660
the blackout mode but really that

92
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,449
doesn't supplement the value in the game

93
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,729
I don't think this is a $60 game I think

94
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,250
this is a $30 game yeah once this thing

95
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,620
hits $30 go out and buy this thing

96
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,440
because this is my favorite quality I

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,169
have not had this much fun in a Call of

98
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,810
Duty since I don't know how long modern

99
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,650
warfare 2 maybe yeah it's um and it's

100
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,600
it's there's just so many battle Royales

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,090
that like they didn't really do much to

102
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,430
innovate the genre or do anything crazy

103
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,080
they don't have their version of like

104
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,100
special modes

105
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,740
you're not seeing like 50 v 50 warfare

106
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,320
or like you know like kill the 10 super

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,360
operator blows me away is that this is

108
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,270
blackout 3.5 and everybody giving it

109
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,880
credit like it's for it's not for it

110
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,580
really isn't you know and and the thing

111
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,090
is is that the reason why it gets a lot

112
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,610
of credit and even I'm giving it credit

113
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,000
it's it it's so much fun the gunplay the

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,120
way the guns sound the hit confirmation

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,060
you it all feels right now what is it

116
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,700
about this Call of Duty that we like so

117
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,010
much better than previous Call of Duty's

118
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,830
advanced warfare infinim warfare ghosts

119
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,960
there's just a hit feedback and honestly

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,060
they they increase the time to kill and

121
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,680
I think that actually being able to

122
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,389
shoot somebody more than once or twice

123
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,760
gives you that good feedback it lets you

124
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,139
know you're doing something there's so

125
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,550
many different ways to kill people in

126
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,139
this game and it's like in previous

127
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,940
games especially with the older netcode

128
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,470
and stuff you just shoot someone with

129
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,520
their dead like they're just day you

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,660
don't get that feedback you're just

131
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,639
booked their dad book the dead and this

132
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
you get to like exchange hits stimpack

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,479
fight you know fights last like a couple

134
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,860
of seconds yeah compared to a

135
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,479
millisecond in the brain right and

136
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,160
that's what I hated I hated the most

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,530
about this twitch gameplay so Call of

138
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,660
Duty faithful or split on this because

139
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,699
you've got the people that they want to

140
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,530
be able to kill you and in half a second

141
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,450
if I see you first you're fucking dead I

142
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,010
don't like that I actually like a

143
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,229
tactical approach and that's what this

144
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,310
Call of Duty offers

145
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,900
time to kill is a little bit higher

146
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,030
though for you call the duty faithful

147
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,680
you could still kill people in one hit

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,810
legitimate there are plenty of shotguns

149
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,310
there are plenty of sniper rifles that

150
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,140
allow you to do that and if you still

151
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,640
are complaining then go play hardcore

152
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,680
mode but Joe have you played hard for

153
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,930
you but you die in half a second it's

154
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,470
fun it is it is fun and that's the thing

155
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,570
with the multiplayer there are some

156
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,250
additional modes here that I had a lot

157
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,560
of fun in the traditional multiplayer so

158
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,570
let's break Call of Duty down into it

159
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,610
it's three components you've got

160
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,380
specialists HQ you've got multiplayer

161
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,870
zombies and you've got blackout so

162
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,880
there's four components to the game

163
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,190
so right away specialists HQ is a

164
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,580
fucking mess it's this is essentially

165
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,160
what's left over from the dead campaign

166
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,980
there are really well produced high

167
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,830
quality cutscenes but they don't they

168
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,070
don't have any semblance to each other

169
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,230
they're just basically you play rainbow

170
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,630
succeeds these are their videos you have

171
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,630
individual videos one mission each that

172
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,910
you play with bots and the blocks are

173
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,370
just stupid let's admit that this isn't

174
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,320
very fun to play through and then slowly

175
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,570
earn the right to unlock the story

176
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,870
behind battle our battlefield black ops

177
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,810
4 and honestly there is no fucking story

178
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,300
I mean there's this lady and wine and

179
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,980
she's like getting all these mercenaries

180
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,010
together but this is not a supplement

181
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,630
for the single-player of if I were

182
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,610
rating this game on purely this

183
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,840
single-player experience

184
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,970
I'll show you there is stories no that's

185
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,370
like a dude no two out of ten it's

186
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,790
terrible what you're really after

187
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,310
obviously are the three components the

188
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,870
multiplayer the blackout in the zombies

189
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,410
so let's start with black are not Black

190
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,700
Album multiplayer

191
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,090
I love the new mechanics added here I

192
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,560
already talked about time to kill has

193
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,940
been raised but what do you think about

194
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,010
the manual health like it you both like

195
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,680
it yeah it just makes you feel more in

196
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,990
control of your character more than any

197
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,080
other Call of Duty you you its it it

198
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,390
also gives a little bit of skill ceiling

199
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,070
there because you have to remember okay

200
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,520
some players are gonna be

201
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,709
on the ball about reeling themselves and

202
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,240
getting into battle other players are

203
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,800
gonna kind of forget so you kind of

204
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,959
separate further between your noobs yeah

205
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,070
and that's what happened to me because I

206
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,020
was so used to not having to do that I

207
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,670
think I'll just hide and regen I was

208
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,459
like he like oh shit I have to you know

209
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,430
he observes you see the other ones and

210
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,950
then you've got these abilities these

211
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,470
operator abilities and all the

212
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,149
progression and unlock and multiplayer

213
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,190
now I would call the progression and

214
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,160
unlocks average this isn't this isn't a

215
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,529
wealth of weapons this isn't a wealth of

216
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,630
unlocks like I was hoping for in most

217
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,510
Call of Duty's there's a little bit less

218
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,850
than 30 guns I believe however this is

219
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,130
made up for by the fact that you have

220
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,779
these different operators with different

221
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,760
abilities which kind of in themselves

222
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,310
serve as new weapons did you like the

223
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,800
skills and abilities I liked them I

224
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,990
think they're a good advantage it's

225
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,690
definitely something that adds you know

226
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,339
variety to what was a rinse and repeat

227
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,320
franchise for the longest time where you

228
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,120
go to multiplayer knowing exactly what

229
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,660
it's gonna be

230
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,270
every Call of Duty this was nice to at

231
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,950
least have like an extra layer it may

232
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,200
not be like a revolutionary layer but it

233
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,329
was like an extra layer of depth that

234
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,279
the game didn't have before and they're

235
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,950
clearly ripping off of Rainbow six siege

236
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,529
again here with this operator idea now

237
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,950
some are much better than us that's the

238
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,770
problem there is that you've got useful

239
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,520
ones like you know what would you say

240
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,100
recon recon is extremely effective err

241
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,230
useful I'm always picking recon the

242
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,720
shield guy is very good laying down the

243
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,779
Rambler yeah and but then there's less

244
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,870
useful ones that really like the golden

245
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,670
gun I guess they were trying to do this

246
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,149
destiny type thing and and other ones

247
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,880
that aren't quite as effective um a lot

248
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,740
of balancing issues with it and the same

249
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,360
can be said about their guns in there

250
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,370
they have these new like operator mod

251
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,589
slots for guns which give them like

252
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,240
special abilities what is that exactly

253
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,029
so you could take any gun most gun and

254
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,060
level up that gun to its highest and

255
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,610
then it's called an operator it's like

256
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,980
the last unlocked perk or progression on

257
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,810
the weapon for example you were using

258
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,220
the Hades which is one of the worst

259
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,590
weapons in the game

260
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,700
I was like Delft for self but then right

261
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
at the end you get a you get a crossbar

262
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,650
for it which is its final up turns into

263
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,440
like an alien smart gun type of thing

264
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
where you get you zoom in and your

265
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,320
bullets look to be bigger and you get to

266
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,150
like perfect accuracy and stuff and

267
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,430
that's cool but like a lot of the guns

268
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,040
don't have those only like it's a about

269
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,370
60% of them have operator mods and

270
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,540
faster than any other Call of Duty I

271
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,430
noticed that people found out what was

272
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,620
the strongest one and just latched on to

273
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,050
it and I'm hoping that they do balancing

274
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,510
with this game where they go oh 90% of

275
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,130
our players are using this weapon let's

276
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,600
tone it down so everything else gets

277
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,880
used and if they do that definitely give

278
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,350
them thumbs up on that but yeah that was

279
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,970
the one thing that I noticed about that

280
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,800
is like people latched on to the

281
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,130
Spitfire for example and it's the most

282
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,740
busted thing and it's just not gotten

283
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,510
touched yet and I'm hoping that they do

284
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,850
because I'm sure they will but so if you

285
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,470
want to get that leg up do your

286
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,990
Spitfires or do your akimbo double

287
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,390
fucking SMG those are fun that's only

288
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,800
when you prestige when you get to the

289
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,220
high level 54 so but in terms of mode

290
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,410
and content within the multiplayer there

291
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,180
are eight different modes

292
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,940
these include what I'd say is the most

293
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,740
fun you're gonna have the most fun in

294
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,310
control heist hardpoint and domination

295
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,340
those four of the eight modes are gonna

296
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,750
be where you're gonna have the most fun

297
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,820
the other four they're pretty standard

298
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,650
stuff either that or they're just little

299
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,200
less fun the other four modes for you're

300
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
gonna be free for all right obviously

301
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,670
team deathmatch again standard Kill

302
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,520
Confirmed and search-and-destroy and

303
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,740
yeah what did you think of the different

304
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,990
modes control and heist in particular my

305
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,910
two favorite controls fun heist is

306
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,710
unique because it reminds me of Counter

307
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,510
Strike and all is it unique if it

308
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,520
reminds no but it's unique to the game

309
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,230
for the first time because everyone's

310
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,450
waiting here you get the abilities you

311
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,310
trade with people like you'll take shots

312
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,660
you'll hide you'll take shots you'll

313
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,670
hide and like that's a whole different

314
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,590
thing to call a duty that I'm not used

315
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,150
to and I was like this is a good change

316
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,340
this is a fun thing I don't feel like

317
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm dying instantly and I enjoyed it

318
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,900
just as much as I did control and like

319
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,160
you said I played those two

320
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,149
exclusively like they were really fun

321
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,069
control nice you're unlocking new

322
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:12,069
weapons in heist as you gain money and

323
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:13,720
you're adding attachments to the

324
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,069
different guns or exploring your options

325
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,980
and it feels earned again it feels skill

326
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,660
base you got to work with your team

327
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,860
members because you don't want to go out

328
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,720
there and this is basically it's just so

329
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,480
funny to me that that we like all the

330
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,730
aspects of this Call of Duty is all the

331
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,529
stuff we like are the most uncalled of

332
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,990
duty things in Call of Duty this star

333
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,660
this game strength taken from other

334
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,750
games the best mode is the blackout mode

335
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,759
though there is a problem with blackout

336
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,110
the progression we've been talking a

337
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,160
little bit about progression and

338
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,410
multiplayer which is good average but

339
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,079
there's the progression in battle royale

340
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,600
is awful like it's non-existent yep

341
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,189
you're sitting there you're doing match

342
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:53,410
after match I placed top 10 almost all

343
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,189
the time top fives we do 1 2 3 place

344
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,430
finishes and we're nowhere near

345
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,600
unlocking any of the carry they're not

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,269
even close to the first level 20 level

347
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,699
20 which I I think somebody did the map

348
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:12,910
for this is like for 400 4444 oh yes

349
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,670
time ok if that isn't the exact number

350
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,579
but it takes you let me see I have the

351
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:20,560
actual numbers here and I want to show

352
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,370
you them ok

353
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,410
leveling and blackout and that's nothing

354
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,920
really you're getting 400 like 44,000 XP

355
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,959
is what you would need and you get like

356
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
a hundred XP you know you get 50 xp for

357
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,449
being in the top five ten xp for every

358
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,480
kill that you make 10 xB and you got to

359
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,600
get 44,000 and even if you play some

360
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,819
number for number one rank you get a

361
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,550
hundred XP yep so how many matches is

362
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,279
that that's like 440 first place

363
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,230
finishes which I don't think you're

364
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,689
gonna get okay every fucking time it's

365
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,970
gonna take you forever but really what

366
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,850
it is is these operators these skins

367
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,540
that you unlock our mission based yep

368
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,990
then they just didn't work right because

369
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,579
they're kind of really hard to see

370
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,949
really hard to activate once you get one

371
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,100
I think ruined for example has you loot

372
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,500
three dead bodies that were wearing

373
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,509
armored you get these destroyed armor

374
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:16,870
plate

375
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,400
it just seems like this these

376
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,070
progression unlocks for for the blackout

377
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,710
mode you know is very slow as compared

378
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,930
to dealer I think that would you like it

379
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,089
if they did global unlocks where whether

380
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,190
you were playing the specialist HQ mode

381
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,750
that is a mess or whether you are

382
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,850
playing blackout it was giving you

383
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,220
experience in order to unlock stuff in

384
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,930
multiplayer be fine by me now I said

385
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,430
this I mentioned this earlier it was

386
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,589
like we were talking about it we we felt

387
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,450
like it was an added on thing like

388
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,910
blackout feels tacked on in the sense

389
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,100
that the progression isn't there then

390
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
you go look at like multiplayer and

391
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,000
there are literal hundreds of things to

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,650
unlock like skins and camos and so they

393
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,450
need to put it over it felt like

394
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,070
blackout was like an afterthought and

395
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,450
they just didn't know what to do with

396
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,790
the it wasn't after yeah it was a really

397
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,250
and this almost proves it yeah and it's

398
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,170
just that everybody looks at the fucking

399
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,510
same in blackout it's hilarious the

400
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,980
little area you go to where people are

401
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,260
punching each other you get to see these

402
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,240
jagoffs that have paid for the season

403
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,010
pass because there's this old dude and

404
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,750
everybody goes around running and

405
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,670
punching these jagoffs it spend another

406
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,730
$50 the price of a game which I got to

407
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,370
talk about this this is locked off

408
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,220
content but hold on this sit but first I

409
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,209
want to say that in blackout there's no

410
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,500
microtransactions I'm like I was so

411
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,420
surprised right now that you can't like

412
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,810
pay and get get skins or get that I was

413
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,330
like wow I am impressed by the restraint

414
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,540
but the cynical mean whispers in my ear

415
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,279
saying Joe the only reason why that is

416
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,320
and that everybody looks the fucking

417
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,779
same is that they're waiting to unleash

418
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,089
the microtransaction system that allows

419
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,740
you to get the scans and look like this

420
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,380
and do is that in order you know all

421
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,870
we're giving you what you requested the

422
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,790
problem with that is in blackout mode

423
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,220
this mode is not free this is attached

424
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,559
to call of duty black ops 4 meaning when

425
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,120
the next Call of Duty comes out this

426
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,280
mode is over with it's not like an

427
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,829
ongoing you know Battle Royale like

428
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,319
other ones at least at least that's my

429
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,179
assumption and then you've got this

430
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,510
season pass that locks content day one

431
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,439
day zero

432
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,990
we noticed that yep so we're looking

433
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,580
through the menus here because I'm like

434
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,769
can I was this old guy how do I get in

435
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,360
it says locked behind

436
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,460
seasonpass and I was like okay well what

437
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,169
do you get with the season pass and then

438
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,149
we look and we find that you get there

439
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:41,620
you know how there are three zombie

440
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,970
modes in the game there's actually four

441
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,010
there's four zombie modes maps in the

442
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,929
game available right now you've already

443
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,630
paid for it on the fucking disk but you

444
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,950
cannot access it unless you pay them an

445
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,289
additional $50 almost the whole price of

446
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,690
a second game you can get access to the

447
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,010
fourth map that's already on your

448
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,000
fucking disk

449
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,669
fuck you Activision I can't believe you

450
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,169
guys are still doing the season pass

451
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:05,830
bullshit

452
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,110
also which splits a player base even

453
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,600
further I mean thankfully EA which is

454
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,210
crazy to thank ya but they're not doing

455
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,399
that with battlefield 5 that's one thing

456
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,320
in their favor but that is some junked

457
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,360
up shit that is anti-consumer that's

458
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,370
anti gamer and that shows how much

459
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,750
disrespect they have for the Call of

460
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,120
Duty day bringing it back to multiplayer

461
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,250
I think matchmaking still feels like a

462
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,299
mess right it's been said we will get

463
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,429
matched against prestige levels when me

464
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,559
and Joe like when we were early playing

465
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,210
the game early we're like level fives

466
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,799
and we were going up against fucking

467
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,539
people that have prestiged already yep

468
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,730
like a full team of prestige versus us

469
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,309
which Dell was maybe level 40 of me and

470
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,019
Joe levels like two and three we're like

471
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,750
what oh wow so we were waxing and I wax

472
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,519
ins like prestige two or three now and

473
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,769
he will consistently get cute against

474
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:55,630
people at level one that have not played

475
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,210
a single game yeah I don't know how they

476
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,220
it doesn't mean I don't know I guess

477
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,870
they've never really touched matchmaking

478
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,850
abilities or something which makes no

479
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,220
sense it's been a complaint it's an

480
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,769
ongoing thing yeah killstreaks are still

481
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,240
here like in other Call of Duty's

482
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,070
they're fun as hell to activate but they

483
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,350
also as in previous Call of Duty's they

484
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,269
do have a tendency to snowball really

485
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:31,350
really hard yeah

486
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,390
if you basically get a team that gets an

487
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,890
edge up and someone gets a hellstorm

488
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,980
they hellstorm into fast strike into

489
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,500
another UAV into an L storm and it's

490
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,680
crazy they just they don't wipe you

491
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,880
boom-boom you even look at the left side

492
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,200
of the screen with all the different

493
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,060
specialists that are firing off or all

494
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,400
the different kill strings it's like we

495
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,170
can't come back like even if we had the

496
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,290
skill to come back we could not go so

497
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,030
it's almost as if killstreaks are kind

498
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,160
of a left over thing from the previous

499
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,230
style Call of Duty's and because Call of

500
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,970
Duty has made all these other changes to

501
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,860
gameplay that maybe killstreaks should

502
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,570
have been tweaked in a way that doesn't

503
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,160
allow for the snowball I don't mean

504
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,780
completely get rid of them because I am

505
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,480
drunk no streaks as well you know cuz

506
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,250
actually what's so much fun about this

507
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,740
one this is the best Call of Duty that

508
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,570
I'm really good at like I am

509
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,340
consistently at the top of the charts

510
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,110
Dell's usually the one at the top of the

511
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,790
charts but sometimes I'll even be del

512
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,650
out and I'm at the top of the charts and

513
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,230
I just feel like the certain amount of

514
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,840
skill level and tactical choice smart

515
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,330
play will make you a better player in

516
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,640
this even if you aren't that twitch

517
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,250
gamer that literally the first person to

518
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,590
see somebody kills that person if you're

519
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,970
not that kind of player you're probably

520
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,620
gonna have a little bit more fun with

521
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,300
this Call of Duty because if you're play

522
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,310
smart you're gonna succeed and that's

523
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,410
what I really like about this one yeah

524
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,150
it's I guess it's just a lot of it is

525
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,710
you know most of the matches like

526
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,050
control for examples very life based and

527
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,210
so you have like 25 lives and once those

528
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,710
are gone you basically lose the match

529
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,630
and the kill streaks just eliminate five

530
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,150
lives which is huge in a limited life

531
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,320
pool so if you get someone that's like

532
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,420
five kills then another five kills off

533
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,890
two in a row the game's over oh yeah

534
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,720
that match is done go to the next one

535
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,010
it's time to talk about zombies what you

536
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,350
play zombies all the time and as you

537
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,060
could tell by Joe's reaction we're just

538
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,530
we're tired of zombie oh yeah

539
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,330
like I don't know what it is about this

540
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,160
mode that people fall in love with and

541
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,780
it's their favorite thing but we've

542
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,280
tested that we tested all three mode

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,300
they're definitely something that's

544
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,130
better than others blood of tears are

545
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,070
the tears one is perhaps a yeah Titanic

546
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,510
one is really good

547
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,430
the stories are present so there's a

548
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,500
little bit of story drop in there but

549
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,780
it's given to you as you play and then

550
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,030
when you complete it so I appreciated

551
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,920
that but that again don't try to tell me

552
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,270
that's a supplement for the single

553
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,950
player it's not this is a zombie mode

554
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,600
there's been Somme bees mode for the

555
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,730
past six iterations of Call of Duty and

556
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,580
the gameplay is relatively the same okay

557
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,350
you're just going up against hordes and

558
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,360
hordes of zombies there's it's very

559
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,800
tension-filled because they never

560
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,540
fucking stop you don't have a moment to

561
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,670
breathe and it's just really annoying

562
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,620
for so it was annoyed the whole time

563
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,750
playing because I know that the end

564
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,850
result isn't really you know it's just

565
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,010
not it's not for everybody I know that

566
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,600
people are downloading the videos all

567
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,490
you love zombies so much but it's it

568
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,590
okay that zombie mode isn't really that

569
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,200
fun for everybody you know else you know

570
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,180
I don't know it's just I went through

571
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,030
the modes the the gladiatorial one I

572
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,070
thought that you'd be definitely using

573
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,320
melee weapons and creating something new

574
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,870
because they market it as modes it's not

575
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,720
modes its Maps you got three maps four

576
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,220
maps if you count the one that's locked

577
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,530
behind the Seas and Fries 25% of the

578
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,770
content 25% Allah guides bullshit but I

579
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,320
really enjoyed the Titanic one the one

580
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,350
in Alcatraz is really good too and I

581
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,180
could see the fun don't get me wrong we

582
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,130
see the fun because we saw we hit three

583
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,180
other buttons and we're like we're

584
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,620
racing around trying to find this fourth

585
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,910
fucking button and you hit on the

586
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,010
fucking Titanic we couldn't find it

587
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,630
we're like what up fuck is this thing we

588
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,580
died were so mad with so it's always

589
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,050
like there's one under the ship or the

590
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,600
fucking shit you know are you crazy you

591
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,300
gotta go swimming once you do it once

592
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,390
you know where they are so yeah it that

593
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,280
little burst of fun there at the end

594
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,750
like I just don't feel like going

595
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,490
through all that other stuff to get

596
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,530
there but that is some people's things

597
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,390
some people just love bored mode and

598
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,340
what if they not their own yes each

599
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,600
they're on there and this year they've

600
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,180
sort of added these elixirs and boosters

601
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,010
and shit that they're starting to do I

602
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,740
mean there's a lot of uniqueness as far

603
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,630
as like the elixirs and the abilities

604
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,630
and classes like there's a lot there for

605
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,850
people in the different gods like okay

606
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,130
so if you are a fan of zombies and

607
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,630
you're probably really satisfied with

608
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,180
what they've done here especially when

609
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,670
you're getting

610
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,520
three times as much content and a little

611
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,200
spin on it but just know that it's not

612
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,440
everybody's cup of tea because frankly

613
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,930
it is a glorified horde mode okay with a

614
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,910
little bit of story thrown in and if

615
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,890
you're not enjoying killing zombies over

616
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,260
and over and over for hours through

617
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,450
across four modes that have essentially

618
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,610
the same game mode then it's just not

619
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,320
gonna be for everybody and unfortunately

620
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,390
it's not for us but I can still respect

621
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,360
it as an above-average experience if I'm

622
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,610
gonna do a horde mode it's gonna be the

623
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,010
call of duty zombies horde mode okay

624
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,890
than any other game so there's that the

625
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,870
one thing I do want to talk about is is

626
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,880
honestly probably the most disappointing

627
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,340
thing about this entire game is that you

628
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,720
look at what they did with blackout

629
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,090
where they took this huge map they they

630
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,040
clearly made the engine able to support

631
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,140
80 players they got the vehicle come

632
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,880
hundred players yeah more than that now

633
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,860
so it's like you go okay what could they

634
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,150
have done with this and I was really

635
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,010
hoping that with all their attempts at

636
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,330
innovating with like bringing in other

637
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,760
game mechanics and stuff if they had

638
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,650
gone and actually given us like a

639
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,440
warfare type of mode where you have like

640
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,090
two teams fighting each other with

641
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,460
vehicles pointless on quest type of

642
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,410
thing oh yeah if they had came in with

643
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,150
that this game would be fantastic

644
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,010
because Brian you would have that

645
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,930
battlefield type of play button with the

646
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,250
call of duty gun play and that would

647
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,320
have been perfect yeah and it's just to

648
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,640
me the most disappointing thing is that

649
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,290
they did not go and innovate in that

650
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,660
work it's more work okay that's right

651
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,540
they are afraid to innovate okay and

652
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,400
they've basically taken the modes from

653
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,960
all the other games and added it to

654
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,240
theirs black out being the most popular

655
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,730
and boy if this game was just like black

656
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,040
out and you know it was devoid of all

657
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,170
the other things like 9 out of 10 like I

658
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,510
am so in love with black I might be that

659
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,070
I have limited experience a battle

660
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,450
royale so this is where I'm getting all

661
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,670
my battle rail rush it seems like it

662
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,930
would have seemed like all right what

663
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,850
but I'm still enjoying it weeks later

664
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,400
and and what I'm hoping is that they in

665
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,290
that even though this isn't an ongoing

666
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,480
thing where the next Call of Duty comes

667
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,030
out probably a new blackout mode

668
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,280
I hope they evolve this one add to the

669
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,720
maps cuz there are parts of the maps

670
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,880
that are a little barren like the bottom

671
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,890
right needs a little bit more stuff near

672
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,980
all that de Factory and stuff like that

673
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,020
and and evolve to it and add to it but

674
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,680
may

675
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,440
that's not even gonna be the case and if

676
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,200
that's the case then you know it's not

677
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,560
evolving it's not you know do even

678
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,770
adding stuff to it that's right not

679
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,630
revolutionize against its polishing into

680
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,070
a tea but everything you see there is

681
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,690
what you get I hope that's not the case

682
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,320
and I hope they add to it but yeah that

683
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,540
but black out easily is my favorite more

684
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,580
part of black ops four quads so much fun

685
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,920
even playing with only three people like

686
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,990
we do we do that all the time and we go

687
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,880
up against quads and it's more of a

688
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,710
challenge but we love it and it feels so

689
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,480
good duo's perfect

690
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,050
however solos oh my god it's nowhere

691
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,940
near as fun as all the rest

692
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,100
the problem is Call of Duty has this

693
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,540
thing and it might just be the player

694
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,360
base in Call of Duty there is

695
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,430
ridiculously dirty camping you'll smoke

696
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,560
just open a door and you're fucking dead

697
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
because somebody has been sitting in

698
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,430
there for five fucking minutes pointing

699
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,980
their shotgun at that door at the where

700
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,180
your head is gonna be and you're

701
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,070
immediately dead there's nothing you

702
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,450
could have fucking done about it I hate

703
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,520
camping in the fucking celeb is that a

704
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,800
problem in other pub demos ya know every

705
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,450
every Battle Royale has tons of camping

706
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,640
okay it's just the way it is and what's

707
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,820
ridiculous is you don't see it a lot in

708
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,350
quads which is the opposite of every

709
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,660
other sort of battle royale is you play

710
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,850
pub G again squats and people will find

711
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,040
a spot and sit there for the entire

712
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,290
match with all four people and just wait

713
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,420
for you and it's in this I think maybe

714
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,740
it's just doing the best you can to

715
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,720
survive yeah I think it's just the Call

716
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,280
of Duty mentality of hey let's just

717
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,020
sitting you know or let's go out and

718
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,550
fight people fight fight fight it's just

719
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,960
the way the game is designed and maybe

720
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,880
it's that mindset but yeah there's a lot

721
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,070
of camping in other games there is an

722
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,900
issue with lag and ping in the game and

723
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,580
I don't know if this is just a lot the

724
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,340
launch week but really it's coming more

725
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,960
from the international side and it's a

726
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,460
big issue that I need to bring up a lot

727
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,080
of international South America and a lot

728
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,700
of places are saying that they're having

729
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,110
to use servers that aren't in their

730
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,760
countries and it's it's leading to

731
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,220
really bad gameplay so you see people

732
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,320
complaining a lot about hit detection or

733
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,510
are getting shot up and lack and you're

734
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,680
like what are you talking about I'm

735
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,300
everything's fine here it's probably

736
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,820
because it's more the International and

737
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,410
I don't know what it is that Activision

738
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,360
is doing they make

739
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,460
dirty amounts of money though they can

740
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,620
make this game really nice launched

741
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,080
globally for everybody with servers but

742
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,970
apparently they're still using the crap

743
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,040
shit yeah there was a bunch of reddit

744
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,750
threads about like Korean players that

745
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,400
were able to connect to local servers

746
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,440
for the beta and then when the game came

747
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,030
out they were being connected to

748
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,920
Japanese servers and they're like why am

749
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,240
I at a hundred fifty two hundred ping

750
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,760
and as I was just lagging the other day

751
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,370
and the the difference between sixty

752
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,140
ping in this game and like a hundred and

753
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,480
twenty is you will lose every time at

754
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,680
one hundred and twenty thing and they're

755
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,570
dropping servers are dropping supporting

756
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,950
yet there are players out there people

757
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,540
out there they're defending Activision

758
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,550
oh they need to charge $60 ready to do

759
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,500
this microsensor and they're dropping

760
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,730
servers and they're lowering the

761
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,290
experience with all these people come on

762
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,180
seriously you could see right through

763
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,130
this shit at least you smart people out

764
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,480
there that are seeing through that stuff

765
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,370
especially with the season passing the

766
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,680
pros it may not be microtransactions now

767
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,630
but I get the feeling that they're

768
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,310
coming it's coming

769
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,020
do you preorder a pre-purchase you

770
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,090
bought blackout points like wow yeah

771
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,730
what is this seem like black ops points

772
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,310
I think it's for the loot boxes so

773
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,260
because I was like oh this raining and

774
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,820
we're about to give it it could be

775
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,760
tentative to change so realize that and

776
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,730
keep that in mind but I guess so we've

777
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,050
pretty much covered it we got the

778
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,600
specialist HQ we've got multiplayer

779
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
which we really enjoyed blackout mode

780
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,530
which we also really enjoyed we do think

781
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,790
that there needs to be a little bit of

782
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,220
additional progression and there's

783
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,900
something to be said for you know body

784
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,300
armor there it feels bad the fact that

785
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,370
the more engagements you get into the

786
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,470
less effective you're going to be I wish

787
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,540
it that may be looting other people when

788
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,850
you win those fights with body armor you

789
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,440
can take pieces of their body armor

790
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,690
salvage their bodies and rebuild yours

791
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,250
or something like that that would fix

792
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,320
everything in my opinion there are I

793
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,000
really like those abilities those little

794
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,550
green boxes that you fire off I thought

795
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,320
that adds something to the game of

796
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,000
course there's clearly some that are way

797
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,070
more powerful than the others like the

798
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,990
dead silence where like you're just

799
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,430
walking also and somebody comes up on

800
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,550
you fuckers paranoia is a good one over

801
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,110
someone's aiming at you that's that's

802
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,100
crazy

803
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,950
so good so they need to add more of

804
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,170
those that are a little more

805
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,060
different drop the lesser effective ones

806
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,160
I do like the looting one where you can

807
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,680
see Luther's like brawler I really want

808
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,170
to actually wish that they would

809
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,910
increase the damage that you do from

810
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,950
fist fighting I want to make that viable

811
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,300
if you want to keep brawler in there

812
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,310
increase the damage you do and it takes

813
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,630
like ten punches I mean maybe a brawler

814
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,700
like no crippled your movement speed and

815
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,740
you could only use your fists for the

816
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,810
entire duration like do something fun

817
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,370
with that and you know they wouldn't

818
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,220
that be that bad and I just find it and

819
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,720
then we have the zombies mode and we

820
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,370
told you it's it's good but it's just

821
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,410
not really for us it's it's a it's

822
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,530
definitely a taste kind of thing but

823
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,940
basically Activision is saying

824
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,590
single-player doesn't matter anymore and

825
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,450
you guys don't like single-player

826
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,460
experiences that's not true listen to

827
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,710
all the fanboys they're like oh no we

828
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,720
never played it's less than 5% of people

829
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,800
that complete that oh that's all

830
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,990
bullshit stats hey they want to throw

831
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,820
those kinds of low a stats at you then

832
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,830
tell them how many people actually play

833
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,140
multiplayer beyond 2 or 3 hours that

834
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,360
completion stat is really fuckin low -

835
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,910
that stuff doesn't matter and they're

836
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,430
taking away our game and charging you

837
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,410
the same amount if not more fifty

838
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,900
dollars for a season bastard that's

839
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,660
fuckin nuts and charging you that to

840
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,460
split your player base even more to

841
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,160
reduce your experience and charging you

842
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,220
for on dis locked fucking content I'm

843
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,280
tired of it anyways so it just makes me

844
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,110
a little mad that that outlets aren't

845
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,090
being a little harder on the game just

846
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,280
because it is the best Call of Duty it

847
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,950
feels so damn good I can tell you it

848
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,360
feels good and I can tell you what I'm

849
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,220
playing it I'm happy I'm playing it yeah

850
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,160
but is it worth $60 no now I look this

851
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,210
up and an IGN breaks it down like a 7.8

852
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,460
mean I hate this shit you just choose

853
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,400
something stop being wishy-washy and you

854
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,680
one thing that in those four ratings Joe

855
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,150
that they forgot you know what one thing

856
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,610
they forgot of course but campaign

857
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,090
campaign should be a fourth fucking bar

858
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,450
there that has zero out of ten but yet

859
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,150
somehow these reviewers are forgetting

860
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,800
the file that might look bad that an

861
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,870
entire thing has been dropped and you're

862
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,410
getting less value and there

863
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,330
giving them praise and alkyl aids for it

864
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,300
no more content now it may not be zero

865
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,100
out of ten to be perfectly fair because

866
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,230
the specialist HQ is there with plenty

867
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,690
of cutscenes but they're just a jumbled

868
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,370
mess and they're unfun to play and they

869
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,830
put together this black ops four story

870
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,560
that's stupid right so maybe like one

871
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,320
out of ten two out of ten at max but you

872
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,730
put all these scores together you

873
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,560
average them out let's go ahead and give

874
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,920
Call of Duty 4 yeah call of duty black

875
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,410
ops for a final rating we'll start with

876
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,670
Joe I'm gonna give black ops six point

877
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,120
seven five s five Niner okay nine earth

878
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,160
god are you sure about that Niner part

879
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,480
at the fourth digit

880
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,300
I'll give it six because there is a lot

881
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,830
of fun to be had for the price point I

882
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,950
can't see it being $60 multiplayer is

883
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,320
like fun with us but they still have not

884
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,800
fixed matchmaking that makes it terrible

885
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,190
get your experience right yeah it's not

886
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,780
funny when you're in those great games

887
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,790
it is intense you love it there's no

888
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,380
snowballing because everybody's but kind

889
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,390
of uneven equal footing but when you're

890
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,700
getting put up against prestigious while

891
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,890
you're still level ten and below like

892
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,990
the kill streaks feel unfair you start

893
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,310
to hate kill streaks even though kill

894
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,140
streaks are badass you know so it can

895
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,170
really fuck with your experience yeah I

896
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,960
um be it's fun but with your friends if

897
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,490
you try to play that stuff for your solo

898
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,190
exactly worse yeah exactly but like you

899
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,110
can make any game fun with your friends

900
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,570
so I'm gonna get tired of that so it's

901
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,090
not really worth it black out obviously

902
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,380
that's why I go to that's we're gonna

903
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,090
spend majority my time we love black

904
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,580
yeah I play pop G but now this is more

905
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,040
like the enhanced version and you can

906
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,980
play with the vehicles a helicopter this

907
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,640
is way better this is worth for the game

908
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,810
what about you dough oh you know

909
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,640
initially I came in and I was like you

910
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,050
know it's a seven but when I start

911
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,429
thinking about the price and I had like

912
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,040
forgotten about the $50 season pass and

913
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,770
how pissed off I got when I was like why

914
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,770
is 25% of my zombie mode locked day one

915
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,490
like just because of the the greed

916
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,750
involved in that like I got a knock it

917
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,530
down to a sick

918
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,179
to be in line with it yeah you came in

919
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,400
here seven that means like if it wasn't

920
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,100
that greedy I could easily give it a 7

921
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,830
but that greed is just so nuts and it's

922
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,720
like the game is fun

923
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,030
there's fun parts of it but it's not a

924
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,340
greater amazing game in there it's

925
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,020
starting to run out of legs right now to

926
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,210
two weeks in yep you're starting to run

927
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:09,750
out of legs

928
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,610
yeah and I'm also encountering the the

929
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,380
same sort of matchmaking problems well

930
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,990
you prestige right no I'm sitting at 55

931
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,390
on purpose oh I just want to unlock

932
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,090
everything would be done and so like but

933
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,470
I'm running into that same problem where

934
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,880
if I key with someone like waxing

935
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,370
because he only uses the Spitfire I get

936
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,950
into games that are all Spitfires and so

937
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,480
if I want to use another gun or anything

938
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,130
like that I'm just like I can't fucking

939
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,140
do it yeah I just yeah well you can but

940
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,760
you're at a disadvantage and you have to

941
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,560
like you know push yourself through it

942
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,240
just a kind of a trolli thing I killed

943
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,850
you what the Hades while you're here's

944
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,650
another thing too it's really gonna be

945
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,600
tested next week because read dad's

946
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,420
gonna come out and I think they're

947
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,980
different enough though Joe because it's

948
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,750
a military first-person shooter you know

949
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,490
if it was going up against battlefield

950
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,230
that would have been a real test to see

951
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,520
what would happen yeah

952
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,190
6 out of 10 and they could have

953
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,810
innovated and if they had just added

954
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,030
like a battlefield mode they can clearly

955
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,300
do it this Call of Duty did have the

956
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,640
potential of a 10 out of 10 I am not

957
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,830
joking and I I would never say that if

958
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,720
the story was amazing really satisfying

959
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,120
ending and they evolved on top of

960
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,460
copying all these other ones and doing

961
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,110
it better now I wouldn't say they've

962
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,430
done it better than Rainbow six siege

963
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,020
they've copied that and they've kind of

964
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,760
done it and it's about average but the

965
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,130
the Battle Royale is done really well

966
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,620
and and all with all that could have

967
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,140
easily been nine nine nine territory but

968
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,870
because it's at seven and depending on

969
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,970
on how much that stuff bothers you the

970
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,300
in-game seasonpass that are locking off

971
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,850
content you can easily go six but I'm

972
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,770
gonna end out out of seven because I

973
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,570
want to I don't wish he watched you

974
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,520
don't go six point eight six point four

975
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,120
no I think it does enough by changing

976
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,980
its gameplay knowing that the call to

977
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,510
duty faith we're gonna cry and bitch

978
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,130
this whole time and be like oh this is

979
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,500
the worst Call of Duty ever because

980
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,450
you're adding to that and creating a

981
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,160
more tactical squad experience that you

982
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,100
together more this thought the spawns

983
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,350
felt better there was far less rambles

984
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,730
running out and you feel like you you

985
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,960
know pig chickens with their heads cut

986
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,290
off

987
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,120
you know I use that description all the

988
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,130
time for call of duty this felt a lot

989
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,050
less than that of course when you go

990
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,670
into certain modes it's still there but

991
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,550
but the modes that we play highs control

992
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,150
domination hardpoint blackout it's great

993
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,960
7 out of 10 the best Call of Duty I've

994
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,530
played since modern warfare 2 and I

995
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,630

00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,490
but yeah well hope you guys enjoyed this

997

998
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,660
