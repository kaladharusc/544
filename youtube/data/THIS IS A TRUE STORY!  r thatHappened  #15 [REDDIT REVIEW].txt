1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,920
Sunburned tomato here.
(That's a nice face)

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,160
How's it going? Everyone?

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,360
That's right. I go outside for five minutes.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,340
Badinga. (it's Bazinga pewds..)

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,640
And I'm back in, everybody.

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,780
Where I belong.

7
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,480
You know, wherever I talk to people online

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,860
that maybe don't know who I am.

9
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm always hit with the-

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,820
Pfft (high-mid pitch voice) That happened.
Yeah, that totally happened.

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,620
Sure right you met that person.

12
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,860
Yeah, I did guys,

13
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,980
It's me,

14
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,080
It's me guys, it's PewDiePie. (Soft voice)

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,200
Why don't you believe me?
???

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,280
When it turns out the reason why people treat me with such indignity,

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,800
such disrespect,

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,900
It's because there's a reddit it's based on disputing these sort of claims.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,620
Okay?

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,660
I am PewDiePie.

21
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,500
I promise.

22
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,620
Stop.

23
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,020
So let's review some of the top ones on That Totally Happened.

24
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,180
You and me, together.

25
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,060
(EXPLOSION)
Smash like.

26
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,580
I went to Walmart

27
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,020
to buy a tube of cookie dough and a box of tampon and as a

28
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,350
17 year old boy was ringing up my stuff

29
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,780
He just looked at me and said it's going to be okay reply and just after that

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,719
He said by the way, I'm 17 years old

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,560
I wanted you to know that so you can describe me in your fake text post on tumblr

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,850
Bazinga, that's right. How could you possibly know that she was - he was 17. Hmm. I feel like tumblers do this

33
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,979
Especially I kind of get it now it took me one post and I mean it's easy

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,810
We're just supposed to take everything at face value

35
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,840
No, no, not me. I'm an intellectual eyebrows. Read it occasionally

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,150
I was in the bank with my five-year-old sister when we hear everyone get down

37
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,869
we all got down except my sister who say

38
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,009
Stealing is wrong

39
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,540
I can already tell this is gonna be great

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,220
The robbers bolted out and everyone stood and clapped the bank manager gave us

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:55,030
1000 pounds for saving the day as well laughing crying emoji laughing crying emoji laughing crying emoji

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,450
Could this be a whoosh you know, this is obviously fake on purpose right? You got faker Deckard?

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,030
I love these these verified Twitter tweets

44
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:09,099
Everyone dies one day everyone even bulls but not books

45
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:17,420
Not words. What don't die my son three who is a lot smarter than I am

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,910
It must be so great to have a fictional three-year-old. You don't have to even change the diapers.

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:30,650
Awesome. It's like, oh I have this somewhat decent tweet. What if I credit it to my three-year-old then it would be amazing.

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,780
This is actually our quit your bullsh*t.

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,000
But you know, you know.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,670
You know is true if you started it off with &quot;literally&quot;. They literally banned camo pants from my old school because,

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,649
people kept making invisible jokes and one teacher had a mental breakdown and decided to quit because of them.

52
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,580
That's right. A teacher,

53
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,640
decided to quit school because people just kept making camouflage jokes.

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,580
I understand, that's- that's what drives a teacher over the edge.

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,200
My English teacher wrote part of a poem I wrote on the board today,

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,340
which honestly surprised me. She had the student guess who wrote it and most of the answers were the President or

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,280
Shakespeare. When my teacher revealed that it was I who wrote it,

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,420
I received an applause and then the President himself came out and congratulates me,

59
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,459
and Shakespeare rose from the dead and say &quot;Well done to thee&quot;. I have never lied in my entire life.

60
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,180
This would never happen to me. You'll never see PewDiePie on this board.

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:38,140
Teacher: I want everyone to write down the people that inspire you the most. Teacher walks over and looks at my paper.

62
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,510
Who are these gentlemen with colored hair? They're youtubers. They're not really inspirational people dear.

63
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,959
They just sit around at home and talk to camera all day meet teacher you just stand around

64
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,000
And talk to kids that aren't even paying attention to you all day

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,220
Continued writing youtubers names

66
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,750
Here's another PewDiePie one I pull down my pants and press them against the monitor

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,910
then my mom walked in and I was like

68
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,269
Mom don't look at me Peter pie told me to really what you should have said is mom look at me

69
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:23,639
That totally happened while shopping at in Target. I heard a girl say boys are so dumb

70
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:31,830
to which I replied say it louder to the girls in the back to which she screamed boys are so dumb - which other

71
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,370
customers replied with a slow clap best

72
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,529
target experience

73
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:42,539
Yet boys are so dumb. Can this video hit?

74
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:48,629
5,000 likes boys are so dumb if she said women are so dumb boy

75
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:54,960
Don't even make me comment about the hypocrisy lib tardes you wouldn't even care. Would you pathetic? Oh

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,509
My god, I asked this girl in my class for a piece of gum

77
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,180
every day for the whole semester

78
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,120
today was our last day and I asked her for a gum and she gave me the whole pack as a

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,289
Parting gift if it ain't the smoothness thing I have ever seen

80
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,120
So she wrote her number on each piece of the gum number one

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,650
How will you know the order of them number two that didn't happen? You're a virgin?

82
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,169
Similar thing happened to me the other night

83
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:33,029
My cab driver had my life by $0.50 and Eminem on and asked me if I wanted to change it to

84
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:42,149
Country I responded by wrapping the rest of the song word for word. Then the taxi clad

85
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:48,389
Even if that happened, it's just cringy. Alright don't care if it happened. How about that? How about

86
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,759
Sided subreddit for you

87
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:58,020
If I lose this bet I'll eat my hat physics teacher who proceeded to lose the bet take his hat

88
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,759
Dissolve it in acid

89
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,949
neutralize it with a base making it water pour the mixture into his coffee and down it in one cup that most

90
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:12,240
Certainly happened as one teacher does of course. Oh

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,950
Not a problem for me to eat his hat. I'll just dissolve it in acid and neutralize it with the face making it

92
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:27,460
Hmm why do people bother why do people bother okay so like I'm sleepy as hell

93
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,300
Lmao I thought I put on my work shoes walked out of the house like damn

94
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,860
My feet cold as hell of course, of course

95
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:46,720
Who doesn't lace their shoe on the outside and not notice it on both feet, of course, of course that happens

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,140
my high school had such a large population of emos that when my

97
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,210
MCR broke up. They announced it via the PA and

98
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,460
offered extra

99
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,800
Counseling that day, how about our if it's true, you're all a bunch of pussy boys. How about that?

100
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,970
Is that a good subreddit?

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,330
I was at Dunkin Donuts and asked for three donuts and a water cup the entire staff

102
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,850
Thought I said three donuts in a water cup. Here's a result can't make this

103
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,090
Yes, you can stop lying. I'm sick of your lies. That didn't happen

104
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,700
Did it say it say it you dumped those doughnuts? You put those doughnuts in that water? No one else stop it

105
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,720
get some help my gender studies professor told me to go to Subway and snap a picture of

106
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,230
A male worker making me a sandwich as extra cred hashtag

107
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,030
patriarchy

108
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:59,290
It's funny because gender studies degree only legitimately qualifies you for a job at Subway

109
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,360
There's no shame in making the sandwich tonight at the gym a man

110
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,380
Looks like a thing Thor go ask me out when I told him I was a lesbo he goes

111
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,400
Oh, chill, you know my sister and I work out a lot together

112
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
She'll be here tomorrow same time

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,480
Like did door just wingman me god of lesbos. We have found the picture of Thor

114
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,770
This is what he looked like this did actually in fact happen. What an incredible story

115
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,419
This is why I hate stories, and I hate telling them because

116
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't believe myself even telling a story and I most suddenly don't believe other people.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,589
Yes.

118
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,740
Hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving

119
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,540
Me actually, I don't find it fun to celebrate genocide and colonization. So I spent this

120
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,350
Thanksgiving blogging and

121
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,500
Protesting, but thanks. How was yours? The class just claps...

122
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,340
They're all just clapping...

123
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,240
FINALLY. *clapping*

124
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,620
FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT.

125
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,780
FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT. THANK YOU.

126
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,140
Actually, I was a teacher. It was incredible and then she did a backflip.

127
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,460
I left a six-figure job at NASA to have

128
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,620
no responsibilities working as a cook at

129
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,480
McDonald's. Not kidding happiest I've ever been. Oh, and is your name Kevin Spacey?

130
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,260
And do you live in the American Beauty universe? Is that what happened?

131
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,709
You did steak stories from movies and apply them to your own thing?

132
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:37,510
Is that it? Pathetic. Not even McDonald's want you, okay? Over at WcDonald's though, we're hiring guys.

133
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,899
Check out new merch. Link in the description.

134
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:47,800
I purchased a plane ticket online and went to the effing Airport and got on an effing plane and now I'm in Sweden

135
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,860
Drunk me is an effing mental case, help. This is actually true. That was me.

136
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,490
I was traveling home to see my parents and I got confused.

137
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,060
This actually totally happened. I feel like the reason why these posts appear so frequently online is because

138
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,589
Face-to-face, you know I can tell when people are lying. I'm pretty good at it.

139
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:12,250
I think most people can tell when someone's lying. We don't really want to confront people face-to-face.

140
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,500
You won't really necessarily- it's easier to just go &quot;Wow, what a cool story&quot; instead of going...

141
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,699
I don't believe that happened.

142
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:24,329
Unless it's someone I know very closely like, if my neighbor is just small talking with me, telling me some story

143
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:27,279
I'm not just gonna call them out be like &quot;Yeah, no&quot;.

144
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,870
&quot;You're full of sh*t.&quot;

145
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,670
And I think that's why so often on Facebook people just post whatever, because they're so used to getting away with these lies.

146
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,199
So, it's an interesting phenomena. What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments.
