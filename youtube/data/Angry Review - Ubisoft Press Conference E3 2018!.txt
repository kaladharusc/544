00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,960
ready well if you're ready for the

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,090
biggest gaming because you're going

50
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,790
gaming then let's start the show let's

51
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,450
do it

52
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,509
and I know it's kind of nerve-wracking

53
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,700
to be you know in that kind of stuff but

54
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,619
you gotta go with people who have done

55
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,080
it before I guess or are just better

56
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,289
practice because some of the pre Ubisoft

57
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,209
show was little does that little little

58
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,510
cringy um and nobody saw what I like is

59
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,130
they embrace the cringe

60
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,819
there was no Taylor in this time and I

61
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,790
liked her but this one was mainly just

62
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,590
let's let the developers talk about

63
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,209
their games let's let the developers do

64
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,030
their own cringe stuff and I appreciated

65
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,810
it so so after just dance was one of my

66
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,510
top games I'll tell you where it is on

67
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,049
the list it's number three on my number

68
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,780
15 games of that I'm most excited about

69
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,209
after e3 I'm gonna have to put this up

70
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,769
on Twitter or something oh I think the

71
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,570
screen is a little crooked so I have to

72
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,049
adjust that but anyway so it's number

73
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,820
three that's how high this thing has

74
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,549
gotten and what did you guys think of it

75
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:00,670
Beyond Good and Evil - I didn't see

76
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,049
enough I mean I get the concept and I

77
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,910
yeah okay there was not enough you're

78
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,660
right you're actually right perspective

79
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,540
I'm sorry Oh from what they showed you

80
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,390
can't really see but I actually saw some

81
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,590
footage I really hope this is gameplay

82
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,930
and everything that promise yep Joe's

83
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,250
the one that showed you that footage

84
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,170
that I've been telling you about it's

85
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,090
it's a gameplay video and you can look

86
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,130
it up in fact I'll drop the link in the

87
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,700
description you look up its 2017 II III

88
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,459
behind closed doors demo kind of stuff

89
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,900
except for there's not a big crowd

90
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,819
watching it represses just to do with

91
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,140
the controller and he's playing it for

92
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,530
you

93
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,420
and I don't know how they got that and

94
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,100
why they put it up and then they showed

95
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,300
so fucking little of that impress

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,610
stuff in this one of the actual gameplay

97
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,890
was more like a directed trailer again

98
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,670
and it was you know showing off yeah

99
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,160
they do this huge ship that that

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,350
swallows up your ship you get boarded

101
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,470
it's revealed to be Jade from the first

102
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:12,380
game what it's a prequel I so cool the

103
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,390
game is sold by now that the people who

104
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,340
you're appealing to now with Beyond Good

105
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,580
and Evil 2 is a much wider a segment of

106
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,930
audience than people who played the

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,430
first and know the story of the first

108
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,110
and know who Jade is and gives a shit

109
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,680
about that

110
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,260
so the for the rest of us were like okay

111
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,060
are we supposed to know who that is and

112
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,610
you're gonna explain smash to black okay

113
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,890
nevermind so and then they come up on

114
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,420
stage and these developers are awesome

115
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,620
they're excited about the game and they

116
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,210
should be excited about the game cuz I'm

117
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,070
just as excited because I've seen what

118
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,620
they've seen but nobody out there has

119
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,100
seen what they've prezi dude show it off

120
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,230
right they don't show like anything off

121
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,820
and then they also did it like a

122
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,170
developer any of you later and they're

123
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,330
like oh the beta will be like late 2019

124
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,860
and I'm like I don't care right now late

125
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,540
2019 it's really far well I understand

126
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,030
why it's 2020 if you guys see this it's

127
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,460
fucking essentially star citizen you

128
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,160
know in in scope with a story and with

129
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,560
the creative current characters but they

130
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,180
did this hitRECord thing where like

131
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,010
you'll be able to creators can submit

132
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,990
stuff into the game and and and and

133
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,320
Joseph Gordon you know yes Joe fellow

134
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,419
Joe was up there explaining a passion

135
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,680
and he was about this and I think it's

136
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,200
the coolest idea but they fucked up and

137
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,910
they said and you know cuz everybody's

138
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,990
like so you want us to do this for free

139
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,230
and actually right and and he did it and

140
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,850
later on on Twitter he apologized and

141
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,680
said you guys are right like our script

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,810
got shortened and it's totally on me

143
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,540
that I didn't bring up that we love

144
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,370
fairly compensating people paying them

145
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,800
for their work so you will get paid for

146
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,300
anything that you submit that they

147
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,780
accept so it but that wasn't anywhere in

148
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,030
the press conference so artists and and

149
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,300
creators in the audience like

150
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,030

156
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,319
corrected it on Twitter and so know that

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
now that they are planning to pay people

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,960
the game is a cooperative game which I

159
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,419
didn't realize that so I would have been

160
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,430
happy just the way it is but this shit

161
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,319

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,280
so 2020 probably it's late and then then

166
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,379
right as they ended that they said they

167
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,819
had the hot mics on that's what you

168
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,349
confuse it for the other conference they

169
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,460
were like and that was a cute moment why

170
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,289
you there's a few issues with their mics

171
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:57,009
airing this cop it was cute the first

172
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,599
time you could tell she was nervous

173
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,930
she's like okay we know yeah yeah I

174
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,560
liked it a lot but imma be 100% honest

175
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,469
with you we saw of you didn't nail it it

176
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,870
you didn't you you did nail it in the

177
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,400
senses you didn't fuck it up and you

178
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,469
were you gave us sort of an average sort

179
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,469
of reveal you didn't nailing it for me

180
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,050
would have been showing what we saw show

181
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,479
and and really convincing people of why

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,039
they should be excited on Beyond Good

183
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,900
and Evil 2 and right now I don't think

184
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,759
people are looking at beyond good and

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
evil - the same way they're looking at

186
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,240
cyberpunk and Red Dead oh they're just

187
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,639
not when they need to be that's how

188
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,259
serious I am someone hasn't seen what

189
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,639
you've seen like that wasn't in the

190
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,990
conference all I've got is what they've

191
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,449
shown me yeah and I just could you gonna

192
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,050
be blown away

193
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,520
after this video we're gonna fucking

194
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,509
show you well let me like yeah exactly

195
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,060
so that's why I say then it exactly nail

196
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,620
it and they need to do a better job next

197
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,960
year and I think since it's so far away

198
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,909
maybe they're saving it for next year

199
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,419
anyway moving on Rainbow six siege 35

200
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,460
million people still play this game it's

201
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,469
a badass game I liked it when it came

202
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,479
out it's somewhat improved since then

203
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,399
and then they showed off a documentary

204
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,830
on eSports many

205
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,360
when the crowd is roll their eyes but I

206
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,919
like these kinds of things because it

207
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,949
really expands gaming into multi you

208
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,960
know multi media and and and in kind of

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,440
mainstream our our our hobby and shows

210
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,180
that you could get serious at playing

211
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,979
these things and and just foster a

212
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,449
really cool community and that's what he

213
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,830
was basically saying hey we got a really

214
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,390
cool community we got more content

215
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,669
coming and then play it play the game so

216
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,169
if I had more time I'd be playing

217
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,789
Rainbow six siege because I think it's a

218
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,279
good game that after that a dude crashed

219
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,250
into a podium now he wrote in wrote in

220
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,410
on a MIDI hook evel knievel looking

221
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,300
baggies meeting silly did you know that

222
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,390

223
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,800
it the Netherlands or something like

224
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,070

225
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,589

226
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,640
also prime minister of Finland the

227
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
primary and he can make that claim and

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,680
all the Americans like prime minister of

229
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,200

231
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,670
fucking cool ass guy having fun and

232
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,290
that's the kind of shit I like to see

233
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,720
from developers because I'm so wild and

234
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,790
wacky and crazy and to know that there's

235
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,140
another guy there's wild and wacky and

236
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,360
crazy who's a fucking businessman who

237
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,700
knows how to put together a project who

238
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,800
knows how to develop a project and let

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
loose have a great time so I think

240
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,920
that's so so freaking cool and Trust so

241
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,959

242
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,770
looked good what do you think about

243
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,980
trials rise and go are you is your name

244
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,130
Dale wait is it is they gonna be better

245
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,990
than that game we play cuz the physics

246
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,310
on that was amazing

247
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,149
Oh motocross a Red Bull energy thing

248
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,190
right it's gonna be way better ninja

249
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,750
we're actually gonna be able to do a

250
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,910
flip and will actually be actually be

251
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,470
able to hold on to Mike look up our

252
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:14,610
video of that it's I'll put the link in

253
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,510
the description so what do you think I I

254
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,490
can understand it's cool I like the idea

255
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,320
of people making maps creating maps and

256
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,930
everything but

257
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,370
one of those things you know like you

258
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,940
said with like smash though and and they

259
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,620
what was cause they brought a youtuber

260
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,450
into the fold he only has like eight

261
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,250
thousand subs maybe eight ten thousand

262
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,500
subs up on the big stage and really

263
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,450
creating and helping them this game make

264
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,580
better cuz he was making a lot of

265
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,110
tutorials on how to teach people how to

266
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,850
play the game and for them to like

267
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,010
mention him and bring it and and do all

268
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,480
that stuff I think that's really cool

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,450
and it shows the kind of company Ubisoft

270
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,550
is and I talked so much shit about

271
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,000
Ubisoft games and I also praised Ubisoft

272
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,440
games when they're good and I praised

273
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,790
their conferences when they're good and

274
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,279
they they are cordial with me they keep

275
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,480
bringing me back they're not one of

276
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,190
those companies like Activision which

277
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,990
completely shuts you out the second you

278
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,089
say something bad about Call of Duty or

279
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:09,190
something like that they keep bringing

280
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,470
you back and it's fucking awesome I love

281
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,029
movies soft so I'll let you guys know

282
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,160
that up front I think but I also hate

283
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,130
Ubisoft I they've got this Jim sterling

284
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,080
did a video where you called UBA

285
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,820
fication where they've got the thing I

286
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,260
think we hate is that they've gone to

287
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,520
the point where it's like checks and

288
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,529
balances every year another Assassin's

289
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,600
Creed every year another game and it's

290
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,160
just you know we love what they do for

291
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,110
people but the games are just again and

292
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,820
again I think they're creating enough

293
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,490
new IPs mixing in with the old IP so I

294
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,250
would disagree a little bit with Jim on

295
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,740
that and then here we go with Jim is

296
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,370
right the division 2 right so we got the

297
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,790
division 2 and it was at the Microsoft

298
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,980
conference but in and there wasn't much

299
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,810
on it right here they did this big old

300
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,779
long kind of boring trailer but let's

301
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,279
talk about the game here because we

302
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,589
didn't talk about it there so what is

303
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,560
your opinion as a division player a lot

304
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,620
a lot a lot more than I have and who

305
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,600
really helped my review be a lot better

306
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,610
with the meta stuff and the nitty gritty

307
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,339
what do you know - the vision when it

308
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:13,870
came out was handled by a believe

309
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,640
massive entertainment it might be red

310
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,430
storm but case in point they took the

311
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,230
original team off that screwed it up and

312
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,670
put a new team on that it's made it a

313
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,140
lot better in the state that it is right

314
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,180
now on PC it's really good right now

315
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,130
it's enjoyable there's content it feels

316
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,480
good it's what it should have been when

317
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,670
it came out and so a division 2 I'm

318
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,870
hoping that because it's the same

319
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,660
company that has fixed the

320
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,520
the Division two will have no more

321
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,200
little issues the balancing will be

322
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,430
better and it'll be what we should have

323
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,560
gotten with the first division but in a

324
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,060
second game I didn't realize there was a

325
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,770
company change or any there was there

326
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,200
was a developer that is that that makes

327
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,270
me more interested because you're

328
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,530
getting new and fresh ideas in there you

329
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,150
know what Joe I don't think we're

330
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,230
getting big we're in the fucking jungle

331
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,880
it's actually it's not a jungle was a

332
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,240
fake little zoo thing in Washington so

333
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,790
so maybe we'll get babies I don't is it

334
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,920
gonna be the return of the walnut pompom

335
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,760
being I hope so but I'm excited for it

336
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,740
and if they improve the systems even if

337
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,240
they don't redo their entire game if

338
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,340
they improve how combat feels they

339
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,870
improve the bullet sponge which you saw

340
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,820
where armor is being blown yeah no no

341
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,710
that that is an improvement where armors

342
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,450
being blown off and it doesn't look like

343
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,190
your bullets are just being absorbed

344
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,770
bullet sponges is a legitimate game

345
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,690
mechanic we like to say that in a

346
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,190
negative way and people use it in a

347
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,080
negative connotation but every game has

348
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,270
that to a certain extent and you just

349
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,890
got to do it in the right way and I've

350
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,930
got my hands on it I've actually played

351
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,340
it hopefully I'm playing footage for you

352
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,980
right now me playing it and I felt the

353
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,770
guns were great the guns felt good so

354
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,450
I'm sort of tapping into what you are

355
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,880
noticing on some of the improvements and

356
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,100
and it was interesting the enemies were

357
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,650
using you know smart tactics it didn't

358
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,600
feel so narrow cuz a lot of the division

359
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,670
you were fighting American streets and

360
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,080
and that kind of limited the way the

361
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,060
combat could work here it's out in the

362
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,950
open there's constant flanking maneuvers

363
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,200
I'm having to use some coordination with

364
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,790
my team members to get the fuck around

365
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,560
these guys and don't let him out flanked

366
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,590
us and so it was a great gaming moment

367
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,240
we were fighting around the down to Air

368
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,740
Force One and we were looking for

369
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,840
fucking loot so it's still the loot it's

370
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,090
a loot fucking quest so find all the

371
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,790
coolest guns and yeah so that's the one

372
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,260
thing they've improved with the original

373
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,210
division is loot is really easy to come

374
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,520
by now and you can buy specific things

375
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,710
you want and it feels good to get gear

376
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,600
down that game and then they did an

377
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,910
emphasis on you know you get this

378
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,740
specialization when you hit the max

379
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,300
level and go into these different

380
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,220
specializations which is pretty cool

381
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,690
they gave me a little fucking patch

382
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,650
because I completed the game and

383
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,220
I think my specialization was fuckin

384
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,740
hell demolition crossbow

385
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,770
rage cross crossbow so you were Scout or

386
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,600
recon or what every time yeah yeah

387
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,570
there's something leave that oh no I was

388
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,270
wrong its survivalist you got survival

389
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,380
there survivalist

390
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,210
yeah yeah and you got a cool little

391
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,360
armband thing dude are you gonna join

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,110
the Tom Clancy's the division they have

393
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,640
did you notice they were doing that to

394
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,140
every toughest of the division they were

395
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,810
like Tom Clancy's the division

396
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,850
survivalist its who identify this so I'm

397
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,770
an expert survivalist even though I

398
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,780
didn't know what the fuck I was I just

399
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,710
hit the the freaking level so and it

400
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,810
like I said the gunplay felt good it was

401
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,880
it was interesting still both sponges

402
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,930
but basically release it I'm gonna be

403
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,210
honest though it does feel like a reskin

404
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,100
yeah you know it's not an evolution it's

405
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,350
not a jump forward it feels like destiny

406
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,300
to from destiny one where they didn't

407
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,850
fuck things up you know no sense thing

408
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,520
they went backwards I hope I hope

409
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,980
division fixes everything that people

410
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,420
because most people didn't go back to

411
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:12,020
that game yeah I don't fucking want to

412
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,730
do that I want to go forward you and me

413
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,890
always go forward yeah and so eight

414
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,020
player raids they talked about in

415
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,550
Division two that sounds cool more

416
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,620
endgame stuff they try to put a lot of

417
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,360
emphasis on that then they showed this

418
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
road map of DLC being free and they

419
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,120
already planning a lot of DLC and when

420
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,530
you see all the idea like off from you

421
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,480
assholes but they said it's all free so

422
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,790
you're like oh fuck you awesome guys you

423
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,100
don't know man yeah even though they

424
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,320
don't cut from the launch game to make

425
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,480
DLC like a lot of companies do it'll be

426
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,250
good we'll see last thing we want they

427
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,620
went to Donkey Kong expansion they had

428
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,120
more music Joe would you think about

429
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,250
this presentation on this okay live

430
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,690
music and then you see the gameplay in

431
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,400
the back that we're playing the music

432
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,880
from the Train as opposed to staring at

433
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,760
one thing

434
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,550
yeah yeah so they they were doing

435
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,760
promoting the Donkey Kong expansion for

436
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,290
for rabbits and I thought it was cool

437
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,270
man I love XCOM I love that kind of game

438
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,280
so we'll we'll check it out on stream

439
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:20,270
then we go to this and boom my top

440
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,179
pirates yeah this is a game this is the

441
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,490
way it should have been you could

442
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,169
customize your shit Oh see if they've

443
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,710
ships customized everything the battle

444
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,090
on it feels amazing it does look really

445
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,400
cool fucking shrapnel going off

446
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,980
everywhere your crew moving around

447
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,910
realistically singing songs cooperating

448
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,390
against much larger shit each other

449
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,820
betray each other taking each other's

450
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,520
loot customizing the thing so all my

451
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,960
worries about are we're gonna be able to

452
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,820
customize can we do our own flags that's

453
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,130
all gone yes you could do all that so

454
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,770
that's why our heart level has gone you

455
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,650
know EXFO mentally upwards it looks just

456
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,260
like your MMO where you have classes and

457
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,510
specializations yeah Irish tips right

458
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,490
just cool that's what we did was like

459
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,770
you're gonna steal every fucking coin

460
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,730
and you you're gonna steal every last

461
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,290
fucking coin and now it's like oh yeah

462
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,510
[Laughter]

463
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,250
it's a shared world in this thing called

464
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,710
the hunting grounds and it's honestly

465
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,090
which see if thieves should have been

466
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,130
now during the presentation I don't know

467
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,450
if this was just a stream we were

468
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,860
watching but it had a lot of audio

469
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,460
issues unfortunately took away that the

470
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,080
sound was muffled at least on the thing

471
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,059
that we were watching but what I got

472
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,910
from it is and I saw your captain

473
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,580
walking around on land now are you gonna

474
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,950
be walking around no I'm gonna dispel

475
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,240
that now you're not gonna be walking

476
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,100
around on land you're not gonna be like

477
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,480
pull up to a land get out

478
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,429
walk around no I think it's probably

479
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,549
just yes it's probably just when you're

480
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,470
walking around the pirate hub to

481
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,940
customize your ship and talk to

482
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,400
different NPCs and that kind of stuff

483
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,520
and just in that area from what we saw

484
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,590
in that trailer so don't expect that

485
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,720
this is a game that's on the sea okay

486
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
this is about seaman it's gonna be

487
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,500
plenty of semen all over the place

488
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,990
you're not gonna leave get ready for it

489
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,900
all over all right so it's and and what

490
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,080
I got from it to close this out is this

491
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,660
kind of to me looks like destiny with

492
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,000
all its loot and it's rarities and

493
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,280
legendary bits and rares that and we'll

494
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,200
see so hopefully they don't you know go

495
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,450
crazy with microtransactions or

496
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,150
something like don't say that sure it'll

497
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,179
be a massive betrayal waiting for I

498
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,160
don't and the developers were so excited

499
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,350
to meet meet us you know and meet you

500
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,390
and and they gave you a shirt and they

501
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,160
were like you bring Joe next time and

502
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,220
all that stuff so anyways if they got

503
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,040
boarding yes that was pretty cool yep

504
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,890
but it's just a cutscene it's like an

505
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,720
auto resolve so we do have to talk about

506
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,320
the negatives that we saw from there and

507
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,330
and finally this is how you do the let's

508
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,850
play you know the kind of style where

509
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,980
they're playing and there's a narrator

510
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,870
talking about what it is it's not just

511
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,169
like hey Johnny five seven eight so you

512
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:27,620
gotta you having fun yeah it was totally

513
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,720
drinking grog with my buddies earlier

514
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,890
let's go fucking pirate me you know they

515
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,020
don't do they wanna do it they did it in

516
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,179
the division man just fake having fun

517
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,360
alright so um and and the only other

518
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,740
thing I could say about skullenbones is

519
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,720
I don't really see the point in the

520
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,059
smaller ship why would I ever violate

521
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,370
the fucking smaller ship did you know is

522
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,840
he's the first one to get killed in the

523
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,090
film he probably has things like he can

524
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,500
stay behind the ship where there are no

525
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,090
guns and he just look at Devon is the

526
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,570
first one it dies he died on purpose

527
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,910
we'll see yeah alright so that's it for

528
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,559
them and then they go on to transference

529
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,070
Joe did you did you do you like Elijah

530
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,640
Wood yes

531
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:20,140
did would you think of his game want to

532
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,880
break feeling where its mix chirring

533
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:30,250
live action yeah I think then it's got

534
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,660
it's a normal game but I think there's

535
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,220
gonna be a vr version if there's a VR

536
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,420
versions could be the best way to play

537
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,490
because it seemed like the guys faces in

538
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,330
your face and then you're like exploring

539
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,070
this digital version of the world and

540
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,690
then there's a digital monster that's

541
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,299
maybe chasing you but the thing and then

542
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,860
there it's like why are you doing this

543
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,080
to me dad and he's a gun yeah I love you

544
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,500
son kind of thing transference and we'll

545
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,799
all be together soon do you think that

546
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,559
he's transferring his son into a digital

547
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,870
world where they can the family can be

548
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,570
all together or as a transferring his

549
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,000
sons essence into him and he's an evil

550
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,160
guy and he'll live on forever what do

551
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,540
you think it it wasn't there like a

552
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,520
movie where that dude transferred into a

553
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,260
digital world and became evil and tried

554
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:28,570
to get everyone else the world it's a

555
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,240
more personal story of family so I'm a

556
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,429
hosted in it but can little digital

557
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:37,840
blocks shadow guy be scary to you Joe

558
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:52,450
does that guy scare you anyway so they

559
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,210
would go to Starling Starling

560
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,549
again so I got my hands on the game I

561
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,429
played it it's fun for it's fun for what

562
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,620
it is it's a simplistic game it's a

563
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,740
little like kind of Star Fox feeling to

564
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,570
it which is funny because they right

565
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,270
there on the stage they brought Star Fox

566
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,280
in there and they

567
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,800
had Miyamoto he was so happy the fucking

568
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,430
guy when they present him the toy of his

569
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,890
so I know you were coming today so I

570
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,350
came with a gift you know it's the first

571
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,470
prototype of the vessel that you

572
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:41,280
research so do you like it Sofia so

573
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,460
thank you very much

574
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,150
so it is actually a vessel that has been

575
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,430
created by the team and they would be so

576
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,910
happy to see you backstage so let's go

577
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:01,830
and join them thank you I love this man

578
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,170
I will protect this man and it's

579
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,610
somebody trying to shoot a bullet I'm

580
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,330
like you gotta protect this motherfucker

581
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,390
because he's so fucking cool and but but

582
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,010
it wasn't about him they're just adding

583
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,930
starfox in there was about you know the

584
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,120
game they went into sort of a depth on

585
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,790
it like I said I've played it you have

586
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,590
these little fucking toys that you

587
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,630
attach on to the controller do they do

588
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,840
anything no but the game does detect

589
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,330
when you're adding a machine gun you

590
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,800
want to add a machine gun by the machine

591
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,750
gun but everything's on here you want to

592
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,110
put a different hole with it

593
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,270
Wow you know you don't need to know you

594
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,490
don't hope you don't need to buy the toy

595
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,120
you think that if I buy a forty dollar

596
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,800
game or whatever price it's gonna be I

597
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,480
hope it's reduced to 40 because you're

598
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,890
right in the sense that you're gonna buy

599
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,960
other things to enhance it but if you

600
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,170
were to spend 40 if they do 60 oh now

601
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,730
you're making a hey you're gonna pay for

602
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,500
that starfox license is that what you're

603
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,140

626
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,750
Fighter the miniatures game predatory no

627
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,670
because you're not selling it as a base

628
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,410
thing without it the whole game revolves

629
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,390
around that physical base game comes

630
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:23,290
with the fucking toy I like the del hate

631
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,840
sin and I like it because I want diverse

632
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,610
opinions here on the angry judge so we

633
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,309
don't want to just tell you how to feel

634
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:31,630
interjecting again i interjected for the

635
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,400
Nintendo video but oh you know we're

636
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,790
doing our job here I like to give you

637
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,500
guys the best most accurate information

638
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,410
I asked to be saw they said it's all

639
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,750
digital you don't need to purchase the

640
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,030
all the different toys when you do

641
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,320
purchase the toys you're just getting

642
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,090
additional interactions with the game

643
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,550
and it's it adds to the experience but

644
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,890
you can get that stuff in the game so

645
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,170
point proven that was wrong in this

646
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,660
instance you know about predatory

647
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,490
business prices has nothing to do with

648
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,470
that this is just you know you could get

649

650
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,820
toys basically like amiibo's you know

651
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,920
what I'm saying so yeah that's it that's

652
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,460
the information alright it's just my

653
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,260
inner child doesn't want me to play with

654
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,920
the toys

655
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,190
anyways so moving on for honor will be

656
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,929
continued to be supported you're gonna

657
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,660
get it for free until June 18th sorry

658
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,550
and put up this video sooner cuz that's

659
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,120
over with but for honor marching fire

660
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,970
expansion is going to bring who Chinese

661
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,880
the Chinese faction is coming in

662
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,400
who plan wu-tang clan who Tang Clan is

663
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,270
coming yeah yeah so I I will definitely

664
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,700
jump back into this I rarely go back to

665
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,870
games from DLC oh no oh no but everybody

666
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,539
has said the games pretty much dead

667
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,400
there's a reason they were giving it out

668
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,980
for free oh there's a whole reason and

669
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,450
everyone I've talked to that played it

670
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,370
said nope I'm not going back wait for

671
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,309
for honor - I need to relaunch this is

672
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,590
one that I do want to try a new faction

673
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,929
because I actually enjoyed for honor a

674
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:13,240
lot more than been a lot of different

675
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,260
people so whereas you know see if

676
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,360
thieves had barely any content in it and

677
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,730
it was a repetitive bullshit and and for

678
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,770
honor in the same way kind of lacked

679
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,450
content but at least it was more

680
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,580
enjoyable in a more full game in my

681
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,370
experience - the netcode problem well I

682
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,740
didn't run into any of that as much as

683
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,630
you guys ran into it I got a little bit

684
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,850
of it but not not not that but because

685
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,130
they're adding a new mode Castle seating

686
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,179
which probably should have whenever

687
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,650
another bear get it I mean there was

688
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,450
sort of a castle seized but it wasn't

689
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,580
like a lab rat point-to-point and stuff

690
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,919
and a new faction I'm gonna play it

691
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,760
again and i'ma force you to play with me

692
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,770
the thing is like there is no work not

693
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,900
enough of a player base any more hope

694
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,460
and I'm hoping that this will bring the

695
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,409
player base back and we'll see we'll see

696
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:04,659
so do it right the first time didn't

697
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,400
apply to see if thieves do it right the

698
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,200
first time applied to for honor but they

699
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,490
could have done much better and now

700
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,440
they're adding new content so I'm gonna

701
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,870
come back to it and only two more things

702
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,610
here so then they had the crew which is

703
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,530
coming out so very soon it comes out

704
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,870
like tomorrow or something for us that

705
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,110
time you see this video there's an open

706
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,630
beta right now and it comes out June

707
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,480
twenty twenty something twenty ninth

708
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,940
twenty second it's coming out real soon

709
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,770
so it's a racing game what do you what

710
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,970
do you guys think this so the first crew

711
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,860
what I really really really really liked

712
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,539
about it was the exploding you know

713
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:39,280
engines and you can see all the details

714
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,049
and honestly I haven't looked at all the

715
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,730
media again to see if that's still in

716
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,559
there or if they said now I will not go

717
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,470
into that detail but hey you got playing

718
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,200
you got this you got this giggles so

719
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,850
we'll play it will play possibly a

720
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,789
review but I'm surprised that the crew -

721
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,470
was a thing because I thought crew came

722
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,809
out and it didn't really do well and I

723
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,760
was one that was I was hoping that there

724
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,890
was a crew - but from what they've shown

725
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,440
off it wasn't kind of what I was hoping

726
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,659
for that a granular detail in the cars

727
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:13,980
and the pieces that you're up

728
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,900
customizing and all that stuff they've

729
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,580
really mainly been focusing on all the

730
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,080
world flips and you can do this and new

731
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,580
conception I meant you know stunt stuff

732
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,140
and you know and all this and then you

733
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,730
can convert from the plane and I've

734
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,530
played it and it actually is fun you

735
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,299
convert from the plane to the car I mean

736
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,559
the car slams down and then you go do

737
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,720
complaining it's been crazy it's crazy

738
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,679
so cool yeah I'll play it and then they

739
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
find they end the conference with

740
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,480
Assassin's Creed Odyssey here this I

741
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,330
already it some I reviewed so you didn't

742
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,409
get to play origins as much as I did and

743
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:54,299
went through it and stuff and Morgan's

744
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,309
on the outside was visually impressive

745
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:00,210
but it suffered from a lot of internal

746
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,010
problems and a lot of it in the world

747
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,980
was really fucking empty the quests and

748
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,990
stuff the people's faces were like oh my

749
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,760
you have to save my son and it was just

750
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,549
shallow and pedantic through my Savannah

751
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,740
set and here's the thing is so they say

752
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,120
they've been developing this for a long

753
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,330
time I saw so many reused fucking assets

754
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,400
in the trailer from the original from

755
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,860
origins yes the lot of the stuff was

756
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,929
retexture not the models the models were

757
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:26,850
brand new but a lot of the environment

758
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,350
stuff and a lot of the building pieces

759
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,990
and stuff we're definitely yeah I can

760
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,270
kind of see that but not to the extent

761
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,740
that you're making it out but here's

762
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,020
this is it's definitely easier for them

763
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,250
to go to Greece from the Egypt than it

764
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,929
is for them to go to all Japan like me

765
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:44,130
and Joe we're talking about or some

766
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,990
other time period but I don't think

767
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,179
that's that it's derivative I don't

768
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,210
think that it's lazy because now you

769
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,940
said I didn't play origins but

770
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,860
motherfucker you didn't play Odyssey and

771
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,780
I've played Odyssey and I got my hands

772
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,300
I'm telling you dude the combat is much

773
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,430
improved they had the Spartan flavor in

774
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,980
there and it is so much fun they have

775
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,630
this beach battle where you've got a

776
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,150
bunch of fucking you know Spartans

777
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,980
coming in and you're doing battle and

778
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,960
you're fighting lieutenants and stuff

779
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,600
and it was awesome it felt great and

780
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,750
they're moving away from what makes

781
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,090
assess its creative cells it's great and

782
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,950
people are complaining about it but I'm

783
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,690
rejoicing because it's the ninth

784
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,080
assassin freed back and guess what no

785
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,320
hold on let me finish let me finish okay

786
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
what was your favorite part of

787
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,560
Assassin's Creed Black Flag Joe what

788
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,140
made us excited about that the fucking

789
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,980
ships are bastard in the skullenbones

790
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,390
almost a whole game made of that well

791
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,480
guess what they're bringing back ships

792
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,700
into a Assassin's Creed Odyssey

793
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,970
you're on a trireme Joe and you can fire

794
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,570
crew it's not this it the focus is on

795
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,460
that because if there's Islands over

796
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,070
here in the Mediterranean and so you're

797
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,830
gonna that's incorporated a lot more yes

798
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,390
there are elements that are almost

799
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,640
exactly like origins like the fuckin

800
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,230
Eagle they don't make no sense but it's

801
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,420
a good way to scout the entire world the

802
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,340
tide took off on the Eagle and I was

803
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,750
like oh my god this is so amazing and

804
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,780
there was a fucking lion the lion came

805
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,400
biting me and fucking trees and I was it

806
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,670
my Spartans lured us again it was it was

807
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,730
awesome in the right direction it's more

808
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,770
RPG like than ever there's dialogue

809
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,410
choices now and I think branching paths

810
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,300
that'd be good this is fucking crazy

811
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,610
battle chance to impress me and I opened

812
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,680
up the inventory and the fucking armors

813
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,320
are so badass of this age like I'm not

814
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,080
that I think the Spartans are cooler

815
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,640
looking than Egyptians I'm into

816
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,920
Egyptians but I don't know why I never

817
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,220
jumped into origins because I can't

818
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,480
think it's because of the stuff that you

819
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,430
told me about it but I was impressed by

820
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,410
the graphics and I wasn't impressed by

821
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,850
some of the things that they were doing

822
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,040
in that game and now they've refined it

823
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,140
and it made it even better in Odyssey so

824
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,050
now is the time to jump in and it and

825
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,890
I'm so happy I was so mad initially that

826
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,930
Ubisoft for not doing Japan but now I'm

827
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,010
like wow

828
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,690
was wrong on this one that's okay

829
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,550
because we have a play so later we have

830
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,060
ghosts of Tsushima ghosts of Tsushima it

831
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,639
was gonna be better in all ways then

832
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,830
then the Saxons creature so now I don't

833
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,929
even wanna Sanskrit Japan I'm like I

834
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,720
want Spartans and that's what we get

835
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,580
here I'm only hoping that they learned

836
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,480
from their DRM thing too so when I was

837
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,950
playing the early version of the game I

838
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,950
was getting like 90 to 120 FPS I shit

839
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,630
you not there was a day one patch that

840
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,880
was like 12 megabytes dropped me down to

841
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,940
20 FPS used 99% I'm a processor everyone

842
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,550
on PC was having this issue I'm hoping

843
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,590
to god they fixed it in the next game

844
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,659
because it was like so the game ease is

845
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,909
like 30 percent 70 percent of them yeah

846
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,409
but we understand that there they have

847
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,120
some Ange engine changes they had some

848
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,560
improvements it was a different kind of

849
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,360
assassin's creed but that's their first

850
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,070
outing this is their second out it was

851
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,130
i'm terry was there it was the deal all

852
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:11,050
the during the five yeah you want del to

853
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,340
believe in until you can pick between

854
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,060
male or female we're gonna pick oh yeah

855
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,770
and guess what it's kind of cool it that

856
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,660
you know cuz this is ubi subbu's and

857
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,400
assassin's creed would say well females

858
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,710
are too hard to animate because your

859
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,890
boobies jiggle fate all that shit is

860
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,930
gone thank you know you could pick the

861
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,460
female character if you wanna she's

862
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,530
pretty awesome but you know the deeper

863
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,800
RPG mechanics the dialogue options the

864
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,870
move away from the Abstergo stuff or

865
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,180
what is it called i it's it's it's still

866
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,080
in there and i mattr

867
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,270
fuckin tired shit please shut the fuck

868
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,900
up with stop taking me out of the world

869
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,760
because though i've always wanted an

870
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,920
open world sort of spartan adventure

871
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,020
when 300 came out i was like i want to

872
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,220
play this game but i don't want to play

873
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,080
a movie licensed game cuz they're

874
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,500
garbage

875
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,680
this is that and i assassin's creed

876
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,130
odyssey jumped up in my list most

877
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,520
excited about list top 15 after e3 after

878
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,290
getting hands on it went to number eight

879
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,450
it's in top 10 that's how much I'm

880
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,700
looking forward to this I am in but just

881
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,220
as excited as I was for Assassin's Creed

882
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,710
Black Flag which I think sadly we know

883
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,150
were reviewed Wow that's our fun we

884
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,500
reviewed that one right before that

885
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,640
we're all dressed up in their silly

886
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,310
outfit with the thing but this one will

887
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,190
review because I even got the helmet the

888
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,830
enemy outnumber us three to one

889
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:42,160
a paltry number for today we die and we

890
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,510
will take victory and watch them the

891
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,660
freedom for our people from tyranny of

892
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,680
the Athenians sports our LaVon I'm ready

893
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,580
you have our costume ready already yeah

894
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,369
sweet I just need no costume ready I got

895
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,230
a buy all the other pieces yo she

896
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,780
alright anyways so that's what they

897
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,790
ended it on Assassin's Creed Odyssey and

898
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,060
I'm telling you it kind of gives outward

899
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,099
impression of what Dells feeling man

900
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,440
this just looks like fucking Origen's

901
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,930
you're just if you do an ass when you

902
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,760
get your hand on it it's like yeah man

903
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,830
this is fucking sweet man it's art I'm

904
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,970
telling you man you're gonna enjoy it

905
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,500
you're gonna enjoy it and you're gonna

906
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,500
make a believer like well this is much

907
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,180
better than origins and I like the time

908
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,400
period better and I think the deeper RPG

909
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,720
elements in the dialogue options added

910
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,880
to it okay and we're done so Ubisoft

911
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,330
press conference Joe what did you think

912
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,089
um you're probably gonna think I'm very

913
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:45,580
biased on this one because of a certain

914
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,830
game mm-hmm

915
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,560
mass going boom no they actually did

916
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,260
present a lot of games that I was pretty

917
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,010
happy to see especially a surprise one

918
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,320
Beyond Good and Evil 2 which came out of

919
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,750
nowhere for me yeah the presentation was

920
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,770
great besides that one thing but no

921
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,140
really technical issues I'm gonna give

922
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,410
this a seven yeah I'm out of seven as

923
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,109
well seven out of ten which ties

924
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:16,420
Bethesda and I know I said that but as

925
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,310
des wins the conference but I gotta be

926
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,050
honest his uh Ruby Saab did a great job

927
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,450
we had a positive vibe

928
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,349
I think that in terms of getting that

929
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:27,849
feeling of the developers really

930
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,930
enjoying their games and passion

931
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,270
and showing them off in a positive way I

932
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,030
actually think that boobie soft did a

933
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,130
little bit better job than Bethesda sure

934
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,819
Bethesda had the Wendy's company they

935
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,530
said you know the day one when you go to

936
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,910
a comforter when you work for a company

937
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,230
and they send you through training in

938
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,460
day one and they make you watch that

939
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,530
seminar they were like here at Wendy's

940
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,339
worth family fast you're part of the

941
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,190
Wendy's for my twenties your wins he

942
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,980
said right then anyway so but that came

943
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,980
through in a genuine way without a video

944
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,980
to sort of doubt it so it's a tie in my

945
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,500
opinion I think Bethesda and hoobae Saab

946
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,780
did both a great job I would've gave it

947
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,089
to Bethesda by far if they showed more

948
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:13,130
for starfield and they showed more for

949
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,740
Elder Scrolls six excited I know me too

950
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,660
that's why that's why when I was

951
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,950
tweeting it was like they want hands

952
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,630
down because I was in the height but now

953
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,800
when you're out of the hype you're like

954
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,180
oh shit that was just logos and yeah so

955
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,970
that's all right that actually looks

956
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,190
badass on them right there see knife

957
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,920
holy beard and I guess it's bare

958
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,900
tinnitus we'll see you guys on the next
