15
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,510

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,540

17
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,950

reach for these brain juices problem stall staying healthy

21
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,910
I've been opening a lot of boxes in here

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:02:00,410

27
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,750
I suppose I could wear this while I ride my new self balancing unicycle

28
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,040
i know i have it

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,379
i know i haven't done one of these in a while I'm just trying to keep it fresh

30
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:52,870
and I felt like went to the QA every single week and it lacked freshness

31
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:58,360
okay Wayne asks thoughts on tropical house music Wayne I don't know what

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
tropical house music is

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,269
wheres GG gg the poodle is with Candace's mother in Texas shall be back

34
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,980
here in New York in a couple of weeks

35
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,599
God you guys really don't miss anything do you was the decision to get braces as

36
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,220
an adult a tough one

37
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,090
yes for those who don't know I braces a couple years ago like they're super

38
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,530
tight

39
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,859
they're really gold -

40
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:38,379
it was a horrible I had them play two and a half years or something like that

41
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:42,069
the worst part is since getting them off my teeth are like getting crooked again

42
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,790
what's the best way to stop the youtube drama feud

43
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,620
I don't really know what the youtube drama feud is but I can kind of imagine

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,019
look people love drama whether you're on the side that's creating the drama

45
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,049
exploiting the drama like a TMZ

46
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,340
you're the people that pay two dollars to buy US weekly or like go to the

47
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,650
gossip sites people love drama

48
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,650
I don't think it's ever going to stop and there's nothing you were acted

49
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,870
possibly do to get it to stop is the rat problem in New York City as bad as some

50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,930
say yeah its new york city there are rats everywhere

51
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,479
take a look at this brave rat it's a growth a commuter took this video you

52
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,300
see the red running around inside a subway car while one guy is sleeping

53
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:36,020
it runs right up his leg take a look at the oh my no asks how do you yourself

54
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,320
created what that doesn't make any sense

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,580
how do you keep coming up with new ideas ah I tried to think too much that can be

56
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,650
really dangerous when it comes to ideation instead of just act just turn

57
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,970
the camera and start capturing something and then everything gels Cameron asks

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,240
how is running going do you plan on racing anytime soon

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,080
you know running is not going well I did six miles this morning at nine miles

60
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,220
yesterday morning

61
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,940
both fast but like my legs are a little sore I never used to get sore

62
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,130
I just hadn't putting in the miles that I should be and the reason why is I'm

63
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:17,090
just so unbelievably busy with work and with family that in the morning it's

64
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,420
hard for me to carve out more than an hour hour and a half to running is like

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,350
not good

66
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,430
I hate having to say that on a scale of one to 10 how happy are you with the way

67
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,480
life is going

68
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,010
no I can tell you without hesitation attend I'm healthy

69
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,720
Francine is healthy bones healthy everybody's happy Candace is doing well

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,970
I'm happy with my job

71
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,330
it's sunny outside what more could you want

72
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,330
if you want to ask how happy I am with the way the world is going

73
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,760
I have concerns how do you keep your feeling separate from your decision

74
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,330
making

75
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,440
you know that is a tough question the decisions I make are almost always very

76
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,580
objective

77
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,940
Candace is pure emotion so the two of us it's very Apollo and I niecy's on what

78
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,230
was your question

79
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,950
boo right question you can have unlimited battery life which you choose

80
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,480
your phone or your boosted board my boosted board my boosted board at that

81
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,810
thing didn't I i would drive it to California tomorrow

82
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,139
weird question I

83
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,240
do you dream with how little you sleep honestly David I do not dream at all

84
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,129
when i'm on breaks or vacation and I sleep and just sleep in and I wake up

85
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,539
and go back to bed

86
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,349
I have dreams like they're wonderful 19 lifestyles that the cadence where it is

87
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,860
right now which is like 4i push for six hours of sleep a night

88
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,729
I pass out and then wake up when the alarm goes off there's no in between

89
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,710
it's okay though I dream all day long while I'm away Natasha says he talked

90
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,669
about greens

91
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,789
i'm lazy i procrastinate I'm not exaggerating

92
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:53,669
I'm just not driven what should i do get a comfortable couch or bed and a huge TV

93
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,500
with lots of channels

94
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,419
I have no idea and laziness is something I can empathize with I have no idea what

95
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,620
it's like to be lazy

96
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,620
I'm sorry Natasha I'm not an expert on your situation

97
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,259
I'm gonna end it with this kid hey Casey my question is what would you say to the

98
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,889
kids that are in middle school and high school just like me a couple of things

99
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,520
ah first that there's no permanent record

100
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,490
and when your teachers or principals say this is going on your permanent record

101
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,050
their foolish

102
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,889
there's no such thing as a permanent record the second thing I would say is

103
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,889
don't hesitate don't shy away from challenging Authority

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,259
I'm not saying be a jerk or let's say be a jerk or be obstinate just to be

105
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,639
obstinate but when I was in Middle School were fundamentally disagree with

106
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,569
a lot of my teachers in my guidance counselors and the feedback I got from

107
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,319
like my parents and everybody around you is like you do as you're told boy

108
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,469
but now as an adult I know that like you don't have to do as you're told

109
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,159
if you truly disagree with someone challenge them and don't back down

110
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:07,009
Candace working late so Marlo

111
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,400
ice cream day with this sort of babe over here I think there's a correlation

112
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,119
between the amount of sugar in the ice cream and her energy level right now

113
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:17,749
hey where you going

114
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,550
yes you in two seconds

115
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:40,699
how to come down here have a Grange's there's something I need to tell you see

116
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,729
while i was giving friend seen that ice cream

117
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:49,519
I had a few bites and then I had 12 Reese's peanut butter cups

118
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,410
today's my second day of eating healthy I failed

119
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
yeah

120
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,230
its morning time now I feel like some of the swelling's gone down

121
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,770
I don't think that it's broken

122
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,710
it's still really swollen
