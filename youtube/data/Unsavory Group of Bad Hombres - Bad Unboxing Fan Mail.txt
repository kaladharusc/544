90
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,370
little attention as I want because it's

91

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,410
a letter that's very moist and I'm going

110
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,840
to read it to determine the legitimacy

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,720
of what's inside also the fact that it's

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,830
written in marker does not help and the

113
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,720
fact that there's an unraveled condom on

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,790
the face that it really doesn't do a
