1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,620
saw for the one when you see jigsaw

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,630
jigsaw between sauna three and saw four

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,070
we've seen about twenty minutes of some

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,929
form of brain surgery or removal movie

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,460
thinks we need to be subjected to a four

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,080
minute autopsy just so we can see that

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,580
John swallow to tape that somehow makes

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,230
feature saws possible no reason to get

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,519
to the main plot anytime soon

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,990
sauna three waited thirty minutes and

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,150
the last movie Hoffman was listed in the

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,890
credits as a forensics officer and now

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,660
he's a lieutenant in what a matter of a

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,090
day or two come the gamma dish he

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,350
couldn't just do something simpler like

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,149
post dating an envelope and sending the

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,860
tape to the police precinct why even

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,510
write that on there if you find a tape

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,860
in someone's stomach I'm pretty sure

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,360
just for curiosity's sake you're gonna

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,039
play this out of that tape you think

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,620
it's over just because I'm dead luckily

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,300
predicts all he found at least one

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,860
person who not only survived his traps

25
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,210
but actually followed his rules later

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,739
his other two Protege is Amanda and

27
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,809
Hoffman became miserable failures why is

28
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,520
he so sure dr. Gordon won't follow suit

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,289
discount Deadpool in x-men origins

30
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,059
Wolverine Elijah Wood it's people

31
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,409
screaming and bleeding from multiple

32
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,600
orifices so it must be saw also this

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,130
random scene gives us a character we

34
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,510
won't see again for another hour and

35
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,770
we'll have totally forgotten about by

36
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,210
the time we do see him no wonder no one

37
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,770
can tell the saw sequels apart you have

38
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,270
to wait almost 10 minutes for a title

39
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,080
screen you know which one you're

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,970
watching won't be needing this cinema

41
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,590
world what is it with this guy by the

42
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,090
way he did this in the last movie too

43
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,799
somehow this robot camera knows it's in

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,090
a horror movie and make sure the footage

45
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,560
comes with a healthy dose of static so

46
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,420
that it can make dramatic reveals Carrie

47
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,280
did this dude go to cop school if we

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,900
didn't everything wrong with officer

49
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,430
Riggs cop training it would take three

50
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,409
videos and 15 send counters to cover the

51
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,210
mistakes also how many people watching

52
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,590
this a year from the last movie even

53
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,450
know who Carrie is anymore oh well at

54
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,860
least detective Kerry's body only

55
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,630
attracted one rat somebody get those

56
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,520
rats off her no seriously it's just one

57
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,899
rat on loan from The Departed what agent

58
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,549
Strahm must already know that detective

59
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,960
Hoffman is behind this because he's

60
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,090
being Dickie McDonald addicted for no

61
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,570
good reason

62
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,000
jigsaw is he the murderer the police say

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,610
he is also this could be the worst title

64
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,560
ever the name you lead with is jigsaw

65
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,270
and not John Kramer you wouldn't write a

66
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,009
book called David Berkowitz let's just

67
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,780
waste book cover space until we finally

68
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,340
get to Son of Sam he couldn't come up

69
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,020
with a better name than modern cultures

70
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,489
sounds a lot more like an art magazine

71
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,140
than something that would do

72
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,810
depth expose on a mass murder who's he

73
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,120
lieutenant regards what commander what's

74
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,069
his problem I'm gonna go with that crime

75
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,630
scene you just came from didn't sit too

76
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,670
well with him seriously did Darren Lynn

77
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,590
Bausman take Scott Patterson aside and

78
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,090
say you're doing great but I need you to

79
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,640
turn the dick up to at least 257 I guess

80
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,260
I don't expect the cop who takes off his

81
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,150
equipment too early or tries to run into

82
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,500
a room that could be booby-trapped

83
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,150
to be at the top of his game but after

84
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,709
his partners Eric Matthews and Alison

85
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,180
Carey got killed he doesn't seem to be

86
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,530
on the highest alert for potential

87
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,209
kidnapping scenarios this article

88
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,200
actually starts with something about

89
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,700
John Kramer but then proceeds to talk

90
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,010
about a war in Prague or some a man are

91
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,090
you even going to be the least bit

92
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,620
scared about something coming to kidnap

93
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,610
you if you know anything about the

94
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,690
killings you should have set up a

95
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,459
barricade alarms and those traps from

96
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,810
the collector all around your apartment

97
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,580
by now in an unconventional crossover

98
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,500
The Riddler has now joined jigsaws quest

99
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,510
- what exactly is jigsaw doing again

100
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,250
despite seeing jigsaw and his crew pull

101
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,320
off impossible remote TV power ups in

102
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,000
the past this one required a cord

103
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,380
attached to a doorknob to do the trip

104
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,880
and yes if it powered on I don't know

105
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,500
where we would have seen that -

106
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,050
obsession to stop those around you from

107
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,080
making the wrong choices thus preventing

108
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,390
you from making the right ones under

109
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,680
these circumstances how are you not

110
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,390
obsessed with finding the killer we find

111
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,860
out later this is really about rig

112
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,510
running through unsecured doors which i

113
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,530
think could have been handled through

114
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,600
disciplinary action but why not make him

115
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,579
run through some death traps I reckon my

116
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,940
fuse is still alive man Eric Matthews

117
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,440
has to be the saddest sack in the

118
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,000
history of horror movies it makes the

119
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,170
woman in Jurassic world that the

120
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,640
pterodactyls played catch with look like

121
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,709
she got off easy so this is 90 minutes

122
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,269
from win how is it even remotely

123
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,190
possible the jigsaw nose rig will wake

124
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,720
up exactly 90 minutes before the ice

125
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,459
melts under Mathews and yes I realize

126
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,079
this isn't the jigsaw

127
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,060
however the franchise surround with time

128
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,890
and killers identities so many times I'm

129
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,660
just sticking with jigsaw TV powers on I

130
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,860
don't know where so we're sitting that

131
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:03,120
dude can't he just shoot the hair jigsaw

132
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
new rig was going to open that drawer

133
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,180
I feel like this franchise truly went

134
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,709
south when it put in jigsaw disciples

135
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:08,970
who didn't know the rules of jigsaw

136
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,140
tests and they made the traps

137
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,790
inescapable because at this point the

138
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,140
movies are as cynical as their annual

139
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,760
release date promising sickening death

140
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,669
and little else this chick's hair has

141
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,739
been pulled for good two minutes now how

142
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,660
is she not dead or bald or whatever the

143
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,320
point of this trap is yet yes

144
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,270
not now not now is becoming them I knew

145
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,160
you're late in movies it's pointless

146
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,510
it's probably one of the most dickheaded

147
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,800
things you can tell a cop who obviously

148
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,690
is concerned about something and it's

149
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,980
pointless and stupid and pointless hello

150
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,590
Brenda an officer will try to save you

151
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,420
so did she listen to this message while

152
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,620
I'm tied to the hair-pulling machine

153
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,090
how did she reach it when it was taped

154
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,530
to her hand and she was chained to the

155
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,360
chair also did she remind the tape when

156
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,760
she was done this man we use these

157
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,670
photos to sentence you for your crimes

158
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,230
is she a prostitute does the movie

159
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,120
really tell you do you care so they took

160
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,770
her time to give Matthews a walking boot

161
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,330
for his broken foot they couldn't give

162
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,010
him a bath or shave in the last six

163
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,380
months

164
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,050
previously on saw wait is this - there

165
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,200
was a three there's a boat me I started

166
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,300
when did it ever end can someone explain

167
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,530
the point of painting something that

168
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,420
only a black light can pick up here but

169
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,120
painting a normal a spleen is day here

170
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,070
damn limp Biskit concerts got really

171
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,040
ultra terrible in 2007 be careful we are

172
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,740
a cameras watching and you must hide

173
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,080
your identity good the new jigsaw have

174
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,730
given him these instructions before he

175
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,200
walked into the motel what good is a

176
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,550
disguise when all the cameras have

177
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,870
picked him up already and this asshole

178
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,000
puts on the mask and decides half who

179
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,010
needs this I'll walk through this motel

180
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,750
with my gun drawn and no masks on this

181
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,280
dude kicks the drunk homeless guy out

182
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,200
but then leaves the door wide open takes

183
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,140
a motto and twists it into some manic

184
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,260
torture mantra this guy he really thinks

185
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,040
he's cracked the case

186
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,660
rolling up those sleeves he thinks

187
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,130
John's ex-wife put pictures of herself

188
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,720
all around the crime scene and painted

189
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
the clinic's motto on the walls

190
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,780
it's the Basic Instinct alibi the one

191
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,310
you can't even define as an alibi

192
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,410
because it's so stupid I'll have to

193
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,320
convince everybody just 12 people this

194
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,230
big guy you see this space it's John

195
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,760
Kramer buys a house documentaries way

196
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,260
more compelling now that I know he turns

197
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,450
into a serial killer this old-ass TV can

198
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,920
pick up a live broadcast of Eric

199
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,540
Matthews beamed in on my favorite

200
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,910
Channel 68 and 3/4 located between the

201
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,490
zebra and the piccolo on the UHF dial it

202
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,920
is your choice if you wish to put it

203
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,350
into his own this dude did some terrible

204
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,570
but it's really entertaining the idea of

205
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,010
torturing this guy when he's desperately

206
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,150
looking for Eric Matthews right now

207
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,700
without you this

208
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,370
dansgame cannot begin force him into

209
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,830
position to face his demons I like I'll

210
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,600
new jigsaw fix when you've got one

211
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,340
person involved in a game have them help

212
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,380
you set up for someone else's game it's

213
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,850
truly the gift that keeps on giving

214
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,680
I mean he didn't even need to put that

215
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,030
guy in the torture device to get this

216
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,890
message can we have some semblance of

217
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,080
game logic in this movie also why did

218
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,820
this message say only become the teacher

219
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,290
and save a life in this shot and then

220
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,880
add a whole extra phrase in this shot

221
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,410
things people never do when they're

222
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,150
suspected of child abuse this police

223
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,960
report has nothing to do with jigsaw I'm

224
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,060
sorry do you know anything about the

225
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,220
Chinese zodiac hell you've just

226
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,420
mentioned Gideon like he'd know

227
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,010
immediately who that was and then when

228
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,690
he asks you start going into Chinese

229
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,970
zodiac stuff just telling who giddy it

230
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,380
is prostitute hangs around clinic for

231
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,840
that sweet sweet Clinic patient money

232
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm glad the writers decided to keep up

233
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,540
the continuity about how no one in this

234
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,130
universe knows how to use a key I know

235
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,720
Cecil told her to stay there but the

236
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,100
other door isn't locked and that would

237
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,420
appear to be the exit where her husband

238
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,160
is closed really what these flashbacks

239
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,260
do is prequel eyes the sequels by

240
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,060
explaining way too much of John's psyche

241
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,680
before he became jigsaw how did he

242
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,670
arrive but this philosophy is

243
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,350
meaningless now since he's dead and his

244
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,640
other disciples aren't following the

245
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,020
rules and the rules have murky

246
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,960
guidelines as it is okay let's review

247
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,410
know we just did that girl loves boy boy

248
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,750
loves girl boy gets girl pregnant girl

249
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,290
loses baby boy turns into a serial

250
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,000
killer this is also known as the circle

251
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,920
of life this wasn't about Rigg saving

252
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,840
his friends it's being recruited

253
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,580
so now Strom thinks Rigg is being

254
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,230
recruited Strom doesn't actually do any

255
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,910
detective work he just stares angrily it

256
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,290
and then shout something that sounds

257
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,129
intelligible

258
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,679
you jump off that block you electrocute

259
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,239
Hamel so I'll point this gun at him to

260
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,469
illustrate how careless you're being

261
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,149
also I'm wondering something

262
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,949
Eric Matthews is so gung-ho about not

263
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,389
giving a fuck what would have happened

264
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:26,619
if they discovered that Hoffman's trap

265
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:27,369
didn't work at all

266
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:28,629
what Hoffman just shoot them in the head

267
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,159
and bounce rig conveniently had a

268
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,749
flashback that would later pay off and a

269
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,519
flashback that Hoffman has also the

270
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,779
Matthews appears to have nothing to do

271
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,250
with any of this other than Rigg wants

272
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,930
to find him so why keep Matthews aligned

273
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,550
for six months for this end game did

274
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,839
Hoffman know he was going to put Rigg

275
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,399
through this six months ago why not just

276
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,810
use his wife I'm beginning to think this

277
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,980
whole series should have been called

278
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,319
flashbacks or just playing flash for

279
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:47,740
short

280
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,569
copyright be damned the message Rigg got

281
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,220
told him to become the teacher and save

282
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,170
a life and to go where it all began and

283
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,420
he immediately thought I know it's at

284
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,009
that school were folks that teacher also

285
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,569
movie covers so much of the same ground

286
00:08:58,569 --> 00:08:59,620
we just saw a minute ago it's

287
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,819
practically muddin through its plot

288
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,139
right now this clock serves as a

289
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,639
reminder that Rick has wasted nearly an

290
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,230
hour which would be a frantic search for

291
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,819
his partner it also serves as a reminder

292
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,319
that you should never watch the movie

293
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:12,130
nick of time how the do they wake up

294
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,170
exactly when he arrives you can't time

295
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,360
this plus a jump-scare in a Saw movie is

296
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,949
like a dick in a toaster just doesn't

297
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,630
belong hold on while I try and come up

298
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,279
with a bitter simile so whoever is

299
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,110
behind all this setup spikes that hit

300
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,000
all his major arteries and missed hers I

301
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,709
guess since we find out dr. Gordon from

302
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,120
the first movie is behind a lot of these

303
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,069
traps he could have done this but think

304
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,689
about this for a second he was able to

305
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,130
accurately shoot rods through these

306
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,630
people with their clothes on and he was

307
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,920
able to shoot these things through two

308
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,389
bodies with a crude machine that I guess

309
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,220
has some sort of hyper accurate GPS on

310
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,079
it and the writers room for these movies

311
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,790
must have been a barrel of laughs saw

312
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,130
what these movies are edited with yeah

313
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,410
say yourself I'm so confused

314
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,880
the hard part with the spikes is over

315
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,920
this is just a key how hard is it to put

316
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,569
a key in the harness and unlock her from

317
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,970
this thing past Riggs judgment got fixed

318
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,649
to get her freedom back Strom really

319
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,660
can't stick with a theory yeah second

320
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,920
address why are they looking for the

321
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,720
second address remember this guy our

322
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,639
planes got a bunch of properties last

323
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,110
known address it's a couple blocks from

324
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,490
here how would you know he has a bunch

325
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,779
of properties but not know all the

326
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,180
addresses of said property

327
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,180
[Music]

328
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,440
also was the guy dusting a loaded

329
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,670
crossbow they must have gotten the

330
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,710
backup CSI crew so their where's the

331
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,950
lair jigsaw wanted us to find that place

332
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,480
where's the new game being played find

333
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,610
what place this place but agent Perez

334
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,320
just said it didn't exist like we're

335
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,340
supposed to know what that means

336
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,720
these agents go through so much

337
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,130
information and talk so fast it's like

338
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,780
cinemasins trying to explain what they

339
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,400
think is going on in Terminator Genisys

340
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,230
keep in mind the scene also happens

341
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,910
immediately after one of their forensics

342
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,240
team gets shot in the face with a spike

343
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,530
agent Strahm is surprised to find out he

344
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,150
has a partner agent Perez who was always

345
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,840
by his side

346
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,540
hello arrest lucky for team jigsaw the

347
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,520
correct FBI agent found the tape when it

348
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,870
could have been any number of officers

349
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,220
at the crime scene or some random

350
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,660
homeless person looking for a place to

351
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,400
crash this throws around the office

352
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,960
scene is brought to you by weird

353
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,060
subliminal cuts of agent Perez as if we

354
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,410
needed to know what strom was angry

355
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,120
about yes I want to give you some happy

356
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,790
news wedding back on and major discovery

357
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,220
in bay at dam lair ask questions gives

358
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,720
few answers though I'm just gonna take

359
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,070
down a bunch of random pictures and I'm

360
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,770
sure that will help me solve the case

361
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,790
there really are hundreds of hours of

362
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,380
interview footage with her I'm guessing

363
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,580
all of these questions have been asked

364
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,500
and answered and he is your lawyer

365
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,090
during this flash sequence are we

366
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,260
supposed to believe agent Strahm

367
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,420
actually pulled a gun on Jill or is this

368
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,130
just him imagining it like how these

369
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,630
movies keep showing dr. Lawrence

370
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,460
Gordon's name and never show you Cary

371
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,260
Elwes because apparently they can't pay

372
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,550
him to remind you who the father

373
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,620
Lawrence Gordon is I want to play a game

374
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,140
much like Kanye West John likes to

375
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,580
listen to his own greatest hits while at

376
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,410
home so did Cecil not go to jail he

377
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,730
stole a bunch of drugs and killed a

378
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,350
woman's unborn child I wouldn't think

379
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,850
that was his first offense either John's

380
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,290
first victim was Cecil the guy

381
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,060
responsible for his wife losing the baby

382
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,890
it is finally important to tell you that

383
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,480
he was walking around a street festival

384
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,890
that day and to show you all the

385
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,510
costumes and fireworks I don't really

386
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,130
know why either I'm just a journalist

387
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,720
I'll give the writers credit they are

388
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,370
doing their best at including jigsaw in

389
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,230
a movie when he is now dead but this is

390
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,730
all the same flashback crap that was the

391
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,170
least interesting aspect of the last two

392
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,170
movies as a drug addict and a thief

393
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,389
you've preyed on the kindness of others

394
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,939
so it was John just memorizing the

395
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,410
speech that he was playing back on the

396
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,670
tape recorder a minute ago there's a

397
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,679
drug user and a hustler who played

398
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,720
roulette with other people's alive

399
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,369
actually you know we didn't do a very

400
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,499
good job memorizing that did he or was

401
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,910
this for someone else and he decided to

402
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,679
do the live show for Cecil press hard

403
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,249
enough and your release they offer like

404
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:37,149
restraints or you can sit idly and bleed

405
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,339
out but couldn't he still bleed out even

406
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,959
if he gets out of the trap he would then

407
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,029
be bleeding from his face as well four

408
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,189
walls build a home he has looked at this

409
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:46,569
damn article I don't know how many times

410
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,279
and he is just now noticing the big ass

411
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,139
bold letters that say four walls build a

412
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:55,689
home you movie is it I guess this guy

413
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,579
wasn't super unlikable enough already so

414
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,439
they added this team I don't have two

415
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,569
minutes why wait two minutes for backup

416
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,100
when you can go in by yourself - what's

417
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,250
probably a well-executed jigsaw trap

418
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,689
[Music]

419
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:09,160
this just seems like overkill why did

420
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,929
art have to go through one test only to

421
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,579
be thrust into yet another test one that

422
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,439
completely relies on some asshole not

423
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,059
walking through the door man I just

424
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:17,470
wants all three and I can't even

425
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,629
remember who this is also saw three is

426
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,100
happening at the same time as saw four

427
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,559
with perfect in sync timing somehow just

428
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,119
think if agent Strahm figures out the

429
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,980
four walls build a home clue sooner both

430
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,879
movies get derailed

431
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,379
can art not at least answer Matthews

432
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,269
question what's it gonna hurt this guy

433
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,499
is about to have his head squash by two

434
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,509
huge blocks of ice that somehow haven't

435
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:38,889
melted yet he couldn't have run up to

436
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,269
the door and told rigged to hold on for

437
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,720
10 seconds art is useless well at least

438
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,189
Eric doesn't have to watch any more Saw

439
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,279
movies so the prediction that Strom

440
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,929
would kill an innocent man happens right

441
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,749
here but Jeff did point a gun at him and

442
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,509
he did slash jigsaws throat so I don't

443
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:56,619
know if we're splitting hairs here but

444
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,419
he's not terribly innocent also I

445
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,919
thought at the end of saw three John

446
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,600
played a tape explaining to Jeff that he

447
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,679
had to play a game to save his daughter

448
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,720
but I guess this movie forgot that and

449
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,189
Jeff just demands answers from any

450
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:08,339
asshole who runs into a room

451
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,079
pretty sure often playing on it since he

452
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,549
was trying to teach her a lesson about

453
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,079
running through doors like this but the

454
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,179
problem here is after 90 minutes blank

455
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:17,559
was going to be able to release Matthews

456
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,029
and himself from the trap regardless of

457
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,110
whether Rigg came through the door or

458
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,369
not what lesson does Rigg learn if he

459
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:22,809
still bust down the door but the 90

460
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,510
minutes were up and nobody dies

461
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,950
I would have probably said something

462
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,420
like I need to get this tape recorder so

463
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,880
Rick doesn't shoot me art hello officer

464
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,640
rank if you are hearing this good thing

465
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,960
art was able to take the time to press

466
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,520
play while his brains were shooting out

467
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,000
of his head

468
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,830
seriously how did no one suspect Hoffman

469
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,450
this entire time just look at him for

470
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,920
Christ's sake we call this look the

471
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,050
Costas Mandalore we're here to find the

472
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,790
person helping jigsaw and Amanda young

473
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,320
by the way with this movie in psalm

474
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,850
three happening at the same time how

475
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,410
does the FBI know anything about Amanda

476
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,150
young being in on this at the end of saw

477
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,650
two I don't believe there was anything

478
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,390
tying her to jigsaw even if the cops

479
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,770
were studying the tapes even her

480
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,270
recording to Erick hasn't been found and

481
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,890
this plan worked out to perfection for

482
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,390
detective Hoffman remember the only

483
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,800
reason why agent Strahm is here right

484
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,120
now is because he had a last-minute

485
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,620
revelation about the gideon meat-packing

486
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,720
plant great timing also one day he's

487
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,310
gonna kill an innocent man thing because

488
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,840
that doesn't happen if Strom doesn't get

489
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,460
a last-second out of his ass League see

490
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,080
I think the giveaway in these films is

491
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,460
that anyone who knows how to properly

492
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,650
use a key is a killer you think it's

493
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,230
