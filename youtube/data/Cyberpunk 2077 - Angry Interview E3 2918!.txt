1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,970
hey guys angry Joe here and I'm with the

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,920
creator of cyberpunk

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,649
and the associate design director for

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,040
the game I just got out of a 45 minute

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,070
demo and if you guys are wondering what

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,279
I thought wow that's what I think that I

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,220
guess we pass yes you passed from what

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,380
I've seen so far you pass now there were

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,990
a few surprising things to me I I don't

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,810
know why I expected it to be dark or at

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,700
night or something like that but it's

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,320
actually kind of bright at least that

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,770
particular demo was in the daytime will

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,620
we see stuff in the night oh yeah you'll

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,360
definitely see stuff in the night okay

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,640
so that there's a whole different Club

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,350
kind of vibe and a whole different thing

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,250
that comes with the night time the games

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,180
gonna have a day/night cycle yes which

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,680
means one of the cool things about it is

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,899
that you're going to not just see that

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,520
day night day night but you're also

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,670
gonna see dawn dusk bad weather good

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,359
weather

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,119
acid rain you name oh my god that's

26
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,280
gonna happen that's freakin awesome so

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,420
this this it's like a mixture of all the

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,110
best from a lot of different games and

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,780
I'm just shocked that's that's real

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,310
right that wasn't script now of course

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,960
the whole thing was opening yeah they

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,060
actually had me sit next to dude who he

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,100
was running the demos on convey he was

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,829
actually we've got shit ex-pro

35
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,939
counter-strike playable moves but okay

36
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,979
so let's talk a little bit about this

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,689
cyberpunk world do you think that

38
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,240
they've nailed this this world what can

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,570
they do

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,659
hell yeah they they nailed it it's like

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,280
they've poured it in you know the part

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,270
where they stick the poured into her

43
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,220
head you know I put in my head and got

44
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,130
everything out hell yes that is HUGE

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,189
okay guys I'm serious and in with with

46
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,079
the world so fleshed out and what you've

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,060
built it I think all that extra

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,430
development time or time that would have

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,040
been creating that you guys get to focus

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,680
on building it refining it and turning

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,720
- fun gameplay mechanics I mean can you

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,470
talk a little bit about the decision to

53
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,300
do this first-person perspective because

54
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,400
I think some I guess just the perception

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,320
because of Witcher 3 is that it would be

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,150
a third person or something but I mean

57
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,860
like from when we were building the

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,360
world up and we're kind of looking over

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,310
the law that Mike sprayed and we know

60
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,870
that night city is going to be on an

61
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,130
epic scale was going to have massive

62
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,560
skyscrapers it's going to have because

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,150
we really wanted to make the feeling of

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,740
like you being oppressed it's a

65
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,050
dystopian society and with lots of

66
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,600
atmosphere so we really wanted the best

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,970
way for experience to kind of soak that

68
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,800
all that in to have all the detail and

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,570
kind of immerse you in that world was

70
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,450
from the first-person perspective I mean

71
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,340
all of the decisions we've made on the

72
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,570
narratives perspective and from a

73
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,459
gameplay perspective in I've been built

74
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,500
into the idea of being first-person so

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,790
all of the cyberware that you have a

76
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,310
like as you as you saw it kind of we

77
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,140
represent that on the HUD it's like

78
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,520
we're not from a third-person

79
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,020
perspective we didn't feel more like we

80
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,459
could create that immersive experience

81
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,830
that we know that the cyberpunk game and

82
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,390
John were kind of like deserves you know

83
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,820
yeah there yeah and ok that's ugly too

84
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,370
that when I first saw the demo we first

85
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,440
walking through it there was a scene it

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,750
made me realize exactly why you want to

87
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,820
have a first-person I was walking in a

88
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,980
car and I was about to get in and I

89
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,239
heard some guy talking about his

90
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,470
girlfriend out of the corner of my ear

91
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,019
just like what was conversations that

92
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,150
you have on the street here somebody in

93
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,560
background are seeing some like oh then

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
I murdered them or something

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,450
and I went I want to find out what just

96
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,709
happened I don't have enough information

97
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,080
I want to turn I want to stop right now

98
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,480
and see this well the whole point of is

99
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,130
pickly in an incredibly urban

100
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,040
environment is stuff happens around your

101
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,530
perception all the time and if you're

102
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,180
above and out of it and you're just

103
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,640
driving a bucket around you don't get

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,670
that same feeling get of being in the

105
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,030
place yeah picking up data looking at

106
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,269
opportunities stuff when you are in it

107
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,180
impacts you yeah stuff when you're above

108
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,670
it or outside of it is tactical

109
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,190
information yeah and definitely it

110
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,320
really seems like the intimidation when

111
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,850
you're walking into these really seedy

112
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,880
areas it feels more cramped because you

113
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,709
have that perspective and when these

114
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,590
Punk's get

115
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,329
in your face to try to intimidate you it

116
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,410
has more effect is that oh yeah I think

117
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,050
it was a right decision obviously we had

118
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,910
a we had the we had the conversation and

119
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,919
scene system from Witcher 3 from the way

120
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,300
we're doing cut lots of cuts between the

121
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,669
characters but in silent because we're

122
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,990
first-person we've kind of tried to

123
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,760
build the narrative into the into the

124
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,350
world not necessarily have cutscenes but

125
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,180
like everything should be seamless and

126
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,889
it should feel like when I'm entering

127
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,320
one of these scenes that I'm actually

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,850
entering it and like these guys actually

129
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,590
a dangerous and yes like should all be

130
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,510
flowing and seamless as I said the same

131
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,250
thing when you guys made Witcher 3 you

132
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,320
guys just need to take that demo and put

133
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,990
it online because that was amazing you

134
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,680
guys have met like so here's the thing I

135
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,050
play all these types of sci-fi games and

136
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,760
I've always wanted a game and there's

137
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,620
been good ones there's been days sex and

138
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,780
and some that have never even come out

139
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,760
that I was like oh my gosh it was like

140
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,720
prey to this takes all of that and it's

141
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,639
the thing that I asked for like I want

142
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,740
to go there you know oh yeah this is a

143
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,740
great you know sort of linear experience

144
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,690
and it tells a great story but I would

145
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,300
also like that plus I want to drive over

146
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,010
there yeah we kind of tried to combine

147
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,500
the best of yeah that's like an it's

148
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,770
it's an open-world you know there yeah

149
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,760
you can go three-dimensional I know

150
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,280
Lowe's me away it's not just like I can

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,070
go out and straight yeah rod Roach robo

152
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,530
roaches are now calling em rope stuff

153
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,880
yeah roadster like but on top of it yeah

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,710
that three-dimensional quality for me

155
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,539
one things I've always imagined a night

156
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,120
city is basically standing like the 45th

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
floor of something and watching the Sun

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,620
going down and hearing like gunshots in

159
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,180
the distance and looking at it and see

160
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,150
maybe is going by and I can get that and

161
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,220
now we're gonna now you can get it

162
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,200
that's amazing hell yeah

163
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,289
and it works that way because it gets

164
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,320
you the place more than it gets you the

165
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,200
game even there's a big long we've

166
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,090
compiled a big long list of all the

167
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,340
points we put it in in the description

168
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,470
of all the nitty-gritty of what was

169
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,810
there what the game is so I just want to

170
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,230
ask you some some

171
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,740
other questions interesting questions to

172
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,780
get some more information like what is

173
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,210
your favorite character that you've seen

174
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,150
them develop and and that you know is it

175
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,400
all your characters of their developer

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,020
that they create some new ones that you

177
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,790
like they created some new ones yeah

178
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,950
which I like like Dexter's people like

179
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,750
that yeah but in addition what I'm

180
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,310
looking forward to is some of the

181
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,990
characters that were in the fiction that

182
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,540
you haven't seen yet you haven't seen

183
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,460
well I'm giving too much way if I give

184
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:04,910
something scary good question like

185
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,650
Johnny Johnny Johnny Johnny silver hair

186
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,740
for example one of our faves actually I

187
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,290
really like the feminine version of be

188
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,780
yeah yeah it's funny Big Mike my son and

189
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,980
I were talking about on the way back and

190
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,070
we seen the original demo gosh she's got

191
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,530
an awesome voice yeah just carries it

192
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,050
and I know I think I'm gonna be her

193
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,110
eater which I I never do that I always

194
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,880
create my own character I'll probably

195
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,530
well here's what's great is that you

196
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,020
could do multiple playthroughs because

197
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,870
it it does actually result in different

198
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,580
paths you can take things differently

199
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,160
yeah so in the demo we saw sort of they

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,500
tried to go in peacefully they use sort

201
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,300
of their charm in order to do it

202
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,430
eventually there's a little bit of a

203
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,250
betrayal and you go into combat but can

204
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,960
you tell us like how we could have done

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,890
that differently

206
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,960
I mean sure like we got the money from

207
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:01,100
the military and then just never had

208
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,070
seen that amazing scene see that's cool

209
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,600
but I don't know why anybody would do

210
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,890
that because what they created there was

211
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,320
awesome but but that is what I like they

212
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,700
should have shown that in the demo just

213
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,740
to really shock everybody and like okay

214
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,850
we're gonna cut it and we're gonna try a

215
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,800
different one or we're yeah but and we

216
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,360
could go in obviously when we actually

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,750
came to the mouth

218
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,370
I know we could just decide yeah you

219
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,050
know I screw its gonna go show everybody

220
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,940
like it's really it's up to the player

221
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,580
we really want to give choices the CD

222
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,620
Projekt RED like tradition it's like how

223
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,810
we make games giving narratives choice

224
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,729
and also gameplay choice as well right

225
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,580
so we don't want to just thank him in

226
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,650
which we obviously had Daryl and he had

227
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,479
a cool range of abilities but we kind of

228
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,380
make it even we want to do more yeah so

229
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,990
many cool roles that might fade in the

230
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,830
2020 and nothing else amazing the

231
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,480
coolers in this day of me or more

232
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,340
internet connection what's gonna happen

233
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,990
is somebody will go down one of those

234
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,090
paths and they're gonna go you didn't

235
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,340
see Roy snows guys yeah oh man and then

236
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,870
everybody's gonna run over there and

237
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,030
they're going to replay and because of

238
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,420
the nature of the design choices Matt

239
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,140
mm-hmm

240
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,150
and you just can't do the linear fashion

241
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,770
which means there are gonna be people

242
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,590
exploring every which way and they're

243
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,840
gonna find certain things don't work

244
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,380
yeah I'm gonna go well yeah I can do

245
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,990
this as be in this version of me but

246
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,839
this other incarnation had a different

247
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,480
life path I for a backrub so it's going

248
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,140
to see since a personal is a yeah for

249
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,450
every damn run you exactly especially

250
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,060
with the flowing class system where it's

251
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,070
not you're not locked into one thing you

252
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,070
can do whatever you want I was really

253
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,260
happy to see that the mature take that

254
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,390
Witcher you know is known for is here in

255
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,910
this game there's nudity it's in your

256
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,190
face okay we got we've got some boobies

257
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,950
up in the face but hey that's just a

258
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,570
that's the way you found her and we need

259
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,190
to get her out of here and ex filler

260
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,050
immediately I mean so things don't want

261
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,700
to put but community in there for no

262
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,790
reason yeah oh no yeah yeah exactly

263
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,650
but but I'm happy to see that you guys

264
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,839
aren't shying away from that and the

265
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,720
mature content can you talk a little bit

266
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,020
about you know I noticed sort of a

267
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,240
relationship or little romance are we

268
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,460
gonna get like romance options in the

269
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,010
game oh yeah

270
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,210
you couldn't take people back for

271
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,320
one-night stands like this live how you

272
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,270
want we're not gonna judge right

273
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,830
obviously that works for both male and

274
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,290
female V so we wrote an original you're

275
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,240
gonna get to do it in this game oh man

276
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,320
that's awesome

277
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,400
for me it's just like we as you saw the

278
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,580
the flow through the demo in the opening

279
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,290
sequence is quite quite linear because

280
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,390
it's the very start of the game and we

281
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,360
wanted to really bring that kind of epic

282
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,250
combat feel and like how like making

283
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,720
sure it feels dynamic and everything

284
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,920
like that but as you're progressing

285
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,890
through the game we really want to open

286
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,720
that up so basically we're and it's the

287
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,800
same thing as what we did in Witcher 3

288
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,390
where we had like the opening section

289
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,830
which you can't like would to teach the

290
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,390
play of the same with the game and we're

291
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,500
kind of doing the same thing here more

292
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,700
linear to begin with and as we unlock

293
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,380
more and more abilities additional

294
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,640
pathways through the level design open

295
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,690
up as well right so we don't just have

296
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,770
linear level design when I have like

297
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,720
choices you want to approach it in this

298
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,370
way I want to people that have never

299
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,050
gone on that particular path and that

300
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,880
was in your previous game so I know and

301
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,730
I believe in another one of my ambitions

302
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,780
which I really want us to be able to do

303
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,710
yeah and it's something that we're

304
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,210
working hard on is kind of to green this

305
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,550
kind of Metroidvania style you can go

306
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,290
back to a mutant the meat factory and

307
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,310
then maybe if you have a new ability

308
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,050
discover or something which has Kulu in

309
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,050
it you know yes there was another that I

310
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,690
saw the inspection mechanic oh I'm so in

311
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,800
love with that kind of stuff you know

312
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,540
like - like Tomb Raider they had this

313
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,770
nice mechanic where you look at

314
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,990
something you learn something it makes

315
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,360
everything it makes the world feel more

316
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,980
alive because at any moment you can run

317
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,720
into something in the trash or pick it

318
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,430
up or something hiding in a shelf or a

319
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,170
safe and then there's this little

320
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,090
minigame - look at it and learn

321
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,950
information that's in this game damage

322
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,900
calculating the usability of that thing

323
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,720
later on oh my gosh because okay I got

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,240
this can I use it later you know so your

325
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,160
inventory is gonna shift based on what

326
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,060
you know hell yeah and we like like we

327
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,590
have a lot of optional ways to solve

328
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,470
quests and depending on what skills you

329
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,060
have you can get more information about

330
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,440
now if I'm an item from the inspector

331
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,850
system if you don't have that so and

332
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,150
it's that investigation game from your

333
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,770
way for a quest based on how much you

334
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,810
investigate items and see exactly and we

335
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,070
noticed a little bit in that in that

336
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,720
impressive boss battle it's good to see

337
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,550
that not only is there good gunplay but

338
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,140
there's also unique bosses that have

339
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,529
different

340
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,170
tax but there was a point where you know

341
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,759
you could figure out a boss's weakness

342
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,040
video your your augmentations and that's

343
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,329
another thing that ties into the

344
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:41,160
first-person perspective you could just

345
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,870
immediately scan and see it it doesn't

346
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,579
have to zoom in and anything your data

347
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,680
really locks in to where you are any

348
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,680
situational awareness is real and I

349
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,879
think one of the important things for us

350
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,199
is that we want to create a grounded

351
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,920
world and like a grounded experience so

352
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,230
we don't want like like it took us a

353
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,699
long time to get the point where we were

354
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,069
installing the scanner like it was

355
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,420
showcased in a way where it has a

356
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,920
meaning to you it's like it wasn't just

357
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,999
like oh yeah you've unlocked the ability

358
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,009
to scan people like a guy takes out your

359
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:13,699
eye smells really cool and you saw your

360
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:16,139
every meaningful mechanic you get in the

361
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,910
game will be giving in a meaningful way

362
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,309
that was harrowing that was a little

363
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,800
jarring and that was the guy that we

364
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,930
trust yeah you guys were saying you

365
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,850
could go to shade here places like crazy

366
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,230
that's what I like but hey one thing I

367
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,910
do want to address yeah you brought sort

368
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,300
last time and that is that you were

369
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,860
saying about the different combinations

370
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,870
of kind of game structures like that

371
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,000
yeah that was intentional from the

372
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,220
beginning of the 20/20 universe yeah I

373
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,230
described that when I built nice city as

374
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,209
I'm building Disneyland in the dark

375
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,939
future and that was to give you the

376
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:55,319
maximum number of possibility of fields

377
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,509
it wasn't all going to be a particular

378
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:01,230
way the world operated but anyone from

379
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,180
one neighbor to another neighborhood you

380
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,019
went from one time to another example in

381
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,670
2020 we used to have encounter - I still

382
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,769
do but we have encounter tables for

383
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,980
areas but we also have times of day and

384
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,660
how they change so you'll be going to

385
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,100
the corporate Center during the day and

386
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,480
it's bright it's sunny and there's guys

387
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,309
in suits and babies laughing a little

388
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,740
bit like that don't be there at 2:00 in

389
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,290
the morning yeah when you know something

390
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,970
you hear the laughter or like one of the

391
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,920
booster gangs coming out and you go toys

392
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,990
oh great this crazy clowns again

393
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,060
that's the part that I like is that

394
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,910
everything is textually built yeah to

395
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,790
not illicit just one kind of cyberpunk

396
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,160
but many kinds you you nailed it there

397
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,750
because if I were to if I were to use

398
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,079
other games like you know I'm saying

399
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,610
which or you could see inspirations and

400
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,190
they're the investigations the the the

401
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,620
open-world you know a little bit of

402
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,529
inspiration or feeling of a day sex and

403
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,500
but you can actually go there prey to

404
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,750
the sort of bounty hunting kind of thing

405
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,540
this idea of futuristic blade runners

406
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,029
from the movie like it's all here guys

407
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,029
and the I'm relatively new to the

408
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,769
cyberpunk universe even though I know a

409
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,709
lot cuz my friends play that I think

410
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,949
that I cannot wait to immerse myself in

411
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,319
this world and play a long time which

412
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,930
how long is the is this game is it

413
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,120
substantial yeah yeah do not be

414
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,509
disappointed

415
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:32,440
yeah and then Plus this has if I'm

416
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,910
understanding it has almost more

417
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,639
replayability than the way oh yeah yeah

418
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,800
I mean for sure you can I mean like we

419
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,870
said you have cuz you're not just the

420
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,240
main storyline things that can change

421
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,910
but also the individual missions in the

422
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,860
combat because obviously Geralt has you

423
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,110
know a specific ways to find but here

424
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,940
there's it could be Robocop you can be a

425
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,459
that that girl from the trailer with the

426
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,889
lay arms and and crawling on the walls

427
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,350
it's crazy yeah see the thing is

428
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,630
beautiful about it is with Geralt you're

429
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,310
playing Witcher and that's your job

430
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,930
description you do that thing you do it

431
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,690
really well but here you can approach

432
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,870
this in so many different ways as almost

433
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,760
different characters so it's a much

434
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,779
wider because even the same event even

435
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,120
the same set of the same thing will be

436
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
different because of who you are in the

437
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,850
game I did bikes yes much sites

438
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,959
motorcycles around like a like you know

439
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,300
a caret style stuff it was disappointed

440
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,350
I was looking forward to seeing the bike

441
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,120
again yeah yeah it's not in this

442
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,009
particular demo maybe for another one

443
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:33,460
yeah

444
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,970
any difficulty options will have the

445
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,380
same kind of difficulty options that we

446
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,710
had in previous games you've made okay

447
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,690
can you just go ham with melee or yes we

448
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,250
have four minutes it's the full melee

449
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,680
system so if we want to recreate Lord to

450
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,630
shanks other Joe loves to play just

451
