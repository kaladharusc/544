00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,820
have success just yet

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,590
then you're gonna succeed and they'll

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,410
want to be these are the two phases that

39
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,510
will happen by the doubters and by the

40
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,570
haters and in between they're scared of

41
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:15,960
you

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,760
so in those kids at school are picking

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,220
on you no it's because they're scared of

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,140
you so they tease you because they know

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,120
when you succeed they're gonna want to

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,780
be you

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,180
now you down here in between now and

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,430
when you achieve success there there are

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,200
two things two things that you should be

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,570
doing and that is to persevere and be

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,540
determined perseverance I will continue

52
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,260
my pursuit

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,270
no matter the opposition you can tease

54
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,790
me you can pick on me you can call me a

55
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,980
loser you can be like my friends parents

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,090
like back in high school and I had a

57
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,739
dropout is that a kid to take care of

58
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:47,880
and they looked at me in the Caza Loser

59
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,930
and they rolled their eyes at me and

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,860
they didn't what their kids that hang

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,200

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,610
care I persevered I continued my pursuit

63
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,580

a special place in my heart for the

86
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,489

87
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,520

90
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,880
as people in the movies the people on TV

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,590
