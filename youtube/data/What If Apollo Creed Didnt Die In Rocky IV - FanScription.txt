[Music]

3
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,510
what if Apollo Creed didn't die in rocky

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:36,280
4 this is fan scription

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,379
a lifelong rocky fan I grew up watching

6
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,800
the 1976 original through 1990s rocky 5

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,170
when rumors of a rocky 6 started to get

8
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,540
thrown around in the early 2000s I was

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,089
so excited I even rushed out to buy the

10
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,980
first three issues of sylvester stallone

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,110
short-lived lifestyle magazines sly

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,149
because they had excerpts from the new

13
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,399
movie script within their pages this

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,129
franchise is in my blood I would not be

15
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:01,870
the same person I am today without these

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,059
films being ingrained into my psyche

17
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,729
from eight years old on as time has gone

18
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,979
by and I've gotten older my love and

19
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,720
appreciation for this series has not

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,970
waned in the slightest it may be higher

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,619
than ever with the recent Creed films

22
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,000
once again bringing in the rocky

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,280
universe new life but even when I was

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,050
younger the fourth installment in the

25
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,090
franchise stuck out to me it wasn't at

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,220
all like the previous three or it's much

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,470
reviled direct sequel I like to call it

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,149
the rogue rocky movie because of how

29
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:31,060
totally different it is robots a synth

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,340
musical score rocky single-handedly

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,130
ending the Cold War yeah this one was

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,780
pretty far removed from the simplistic

33
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,970
charm of the first film a friend of mine

34
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,770
once described it as having all the

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,570
shine of a great movie if you look at it

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,799
from the outside it's this

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,680
larger-than-life epic but on the inside

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,140
it's empty there's not much to it

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,210
revenge robots and Russia that's what

40
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,130
many people take away from rocky 4 and

41
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,119
the over-the-top

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,700
80s nosov its presentation to this day

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,619
it's still the highest grossing film in

44
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,990
the franchise and was one of 1985's

45
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,479
biggest theatrical releases needless to

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,430
say it connected with its audience but

47
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,410
I've always thought there is a really

48
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,190
good story

49
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,989
beneath the dated cultural disposition

50
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,630
and awkward jokes in my opinion the

51
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,760
biggest sin this movie committed was

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,750
killing Apollo Creed

53
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,740
[Music]

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,410
by the end of rocky 3 Apollo was

55
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,270
becoming a complete character he had

56
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,070
gotten ample time to develop as the

57
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,020
antagonist of the first two movies but

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,850
in the second sequel his willingness to

59
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,710
help train rocky in his championship

60
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,630
rematch with clubber Lang had taken the

61
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,510
former champ in a bold new direction

62
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,650
becoming an allied to his old rival

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,110
proved to be a popular turn while his

64
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,940
motivation to help rocky get the title

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,060
back wasn't 100% selfless we saw a side

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,610
to Apollo that endeared him to many once

67
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,890
enemies rocky and Apollo had now grown

68
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,600
to be very close friends who knew each

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,880
other in ways only they could understand

70
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,220
by the time rocky 4 rolled around both

71
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,930
men weren't as young as they used to be

72
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,880
Rocky seemed okay with accepting this

73
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,980
but Apollo wasn't so quick to admit that

74
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,230
fact and probably the best character

75
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,670
seen in the movie we see the

76
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,840
stubbornness that would eventually

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,330
become Apollo's downfall and without

78
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,570
some some challenge fact in the water

79
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,850
you may as well be danced out this is

80
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,650
the basis of everything

81
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,990
Apollo's resistance to change his pride

82
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,940
getting in the way of his common sense

83
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,830
it's not the first time we saw that in

84
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,750
this series remember in the last round

85
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,850
of the fight in rocky 2 all Apollo had

86
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,890
to do was stay away from Balboa and he

87
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,720
would have retained his title this time

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
however the consequence was losing more

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,340
than just his championship now I've

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,380
always felt that Apollo's death in rocky

91
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,810
4 was cheap they wasted a great

92
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,520
character just to give Rocky the

93
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,590
motivation to avenge him in a hostile

94
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,930
Soviet environment there still needs to

95
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,030
be consequences for Apollo's actions but

96
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,310
death is the easy way out here Apollo

97
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,290
rather dying than living with the shame

98
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,300
of losing to Drago and the fashion he

99
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,300
did is a cautionary outcome but most of

100
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,610
us don't die when we fail we have to

101
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,500
learn how to live with it and move on

102
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,720
something Apollo admits that he couldn't

103
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,760
even do in his loss too rocky in the

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,849
second film

105
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,859
one second you beat me by one second one

106
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,420
second that's very hard for a man of my

107
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,099
intelligence the hell is it but didn't

108
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,659
you say up that bitch you learned how to

109
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,190
live with it I like moving forward no

110
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,289
matter what is pretty much the basis of

111
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,210
the Rocky movies in general seeing that

112
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,250
moral apply to a guy who's portrayed to

113
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,289
be the proudest among us it's where we

114
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,330
can see a much more interesting story

115
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,180
play out our changes start in the first

116
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,949
fight with Drago up until this point

117
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,870
everything happens as it does in the

118
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,849
original version well maybe a little

119
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,889
less robot at this point Apollo's

120
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:46,349
confidence is at an all-time high at the

121
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,270
same time it's obvious he's going

122
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,490
through a sort of midlife crisis in the

123
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,380
Rocky movies timeline it would be around

124
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,759
this point that he cheats on his wife

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,340
and conceives Adonis while in the state

126
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,900
of mind that he was shown to be in

127
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,180
that's not a stretch to imagine Apollo

128
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,220
gets pummeled in that first round and we

129
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,139
still have him worn rocky to not stop

130
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,270
the fight in this second round is where

131
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,400
we diverge Apollo is once again

132
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,470
relentlessly attacked by Drago

133
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,840
rocky however is more ready to stop the

134
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,090
fight and save his friend then see pride

135
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,169
become his demands

136
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,599
Apollo is violently beaten to the point

137
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,610
of unconsciousness the ropes are the

138
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,009
only thing holding him up however before

139
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,750
Drago delivers the final blow

140
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,880
rocky actually throws in the towel

141
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,159
prompting the ref to aggressively stop

142
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,979
Drago rocky Paulie and Tony also rush

143
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,050
into the ring to keep Drago away the

144
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,940
fight is then awarded to the Siberian

145
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,000
Bowl by TKO Apollo collapses in a heap

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,620
and the ending of this scene plays out

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,970
just about the same way

148
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,430
rocky holding Apollo's bloodied body as

149
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,590
he exchanges hateful stares with the

150
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,889
Russian instead of dissolving - Apollo's

151
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,229
funeral we fade to a hospital room where

152
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,479
Apollo's wife Marianne is talking with a

153
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,520
doctor Tony and Paulie are sitting

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,530
outside looking emotionally drained and

155
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,419
peering into the room through a window

156
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,180
are rocky and Adrian it is revealed to

157
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,680
be several days removed from the fight

158
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,449
and while Apollo has made it out of the

159
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,889
woods in terms of the fight for his life

160
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,229
we find out that he has been partially

161
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,630
paralyzed due to brain trauma affecting

162
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,130
some of Apollo's motor skills

163
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,529
the doctors doubt he'll ever walk again

164
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,630
Marianne steps out and says that Apollo

165
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,590
is awake

166
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,420
lucky can go in to see him rocky

167
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,520
cautiously enters the room and stands

168
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,770
next to Apollo's bed it's not a pretty

169
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,810
sight the once proud champion has been

170
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,610
reduced to a shell of his former self

171
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,710
bitter and angry

172
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,870
Apollo lashes out at rocky with all the

173
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,610
venom he can muster for throwing in the

174
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,070
towel Balboa is baffled by this reaction

175
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,200
he had saved his friend's life but

176
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,480
according to Apollo he'd rather be dead

177
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,280
than live as an invalid their

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,200
confrontation ends with Apollo kicking

179
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,570
rocky out of the room heartbroken rocky

180
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,540
obliges all the frustrations sadness and

181
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,250
anger that rocky has been feeling is

182
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,200
then directed straight and Apollo's

183
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,160
assailant Ivan Drago as he's alluded to

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,930
but not directly shown in the actual

185
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,300
movie Rocky demands a fight with Drago

186
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,430
the boxing commission refuses to

187
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,170
sanction the match and to get his hands

188
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,300
on the Russian Rocky gives up his title

189
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,640
this is focused on a little more it

190
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,960
should have been a bigger deal and

191
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,670
reflective of the fact that boxing

192
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,680
officials in the US don't trust rocky

193
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,230
not to get seriously hurt in this match

194
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,270
rocky pursues the fight anyway and it's

195
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,190
announced for December 25th in the

196
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,590
Soviet Union Adrian is of course opposed

197
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,480
to rocky fighting and we still get that

198
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,130
great scene in their house where she

199
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,870
admits she doesn't believe her husband

200
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:43,320
is up to this particular challenge in an

201
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,790
exchange reminiscent of a few

202
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,380
conversations in the first two films

203
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,050
tony has a talk with his former pupil to

204
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,760
tell him he's traveling with Rocky to

205
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,740
Russia to help him train it's been

206
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,090
several months since the fight with

207
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,770
Drago and while Apollo has recovered

208
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,750
much more than his doctors previously

209
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,580
thought it is confirmed he will be

210
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,590
permanently paralyzed from the waist

211
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,020
down rocky and Apollo haven't spoken in

212
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,390
months but Tony knows rocky is doing all

213
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,880
of this for his friend he urges Apollo -

214
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,290
once again Apollo stubborn as ever

215
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,450
remained silent as Tony leaves the room

216
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,430
now the deck is stacked against rocky

217
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,840
even more than before

218
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,610
boxing officials don't believe in him

219
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,650
his wife doesn't believe in him and even

220
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,270
Apollo doesn't seem to believe in him

221
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,310
the only person rocky can have a true

222
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,560
heart-to-heart with is his son that

223
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
scene with them before he leaves

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,400
absolutely stays in and means much more

225
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,060
now

226
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,680
his son's innocence and faith in his

227
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,080
father gives the elder Balboa a small

228
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,870
boost and it's one he sorely needed Tony

229
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,730
and Pauly are the only ones who travel

230
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,710
with rocky to Russia and everything from

231
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,150
their arrival to the first training

232
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,580
montage pretty much stays the same the

233
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,470
only slight alteration would be in the

234
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,180
scene with rocky and Tony where his

235
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,100
trainer reminds him that while Apollo is

236
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,350
headstrong he knows deep down he

237
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,270
appreciates what rocky is doing for him

238
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,279
and like it or not he'll still be the

239
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,370
one the one that's gonna keep his spirit

240
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,320
alive you're the one after the first

241
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,510
training montage Adrian is still shown

242
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,520
to have arrived in Russia and the couple

243
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,460
embraces accept here she says she's not

244
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,029
alone

245
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,160
rocky notices a van pull up to the house

246
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
and out of it emerges Apollo Creed in a

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,200
wheelchair when they notice each other

248
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,770
the rivals turned friends share a heavy

249
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,870
complicated look cut to a scene with

250
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,210
just Apollo and rocky in the bar this is

251
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,740
where the heart of the movie takes

252
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,140
center stage after Apollo answers a few

253
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,640
questions about his physical well-being

254
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,160
he apologizes to Rocky and thanks him

255
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,350
for likely saving his life this is

256
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,180
something completely new for the Creed

257
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,130
character and it would be fitting to see

258
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,230
Apollo is always the consistently

259
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,810
confident and obstinate personality but

260
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,150
we see him grow from rocky to to rocky 3

261
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,220
and now we can see him faced with the

262
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,500
biggest challenge of his life in rocky 4

263
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,750
how does a man whose identity and

264
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,160
self-image that were built almost

265
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,070
exclusively on his physical ability deal

266
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,350
with having all of that taken away where

267
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,580
does he go from there

268
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,710
how and in what direction does he move

269
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,200
forward I think those are much more

270
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,190
interesting and thought-provoking

271
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,160
questions than just having him die it

272
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,260
always felt to me like a lazy excuse to

273
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,240
get to the rocky drago grudge match we

274
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,050
can do better

275
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,089
having Apollo set out on a new life

276
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,010
after this chapter is permanently closed

277
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,050
will be far more compelling and

278
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,540
captivating after the friends reconcile

279
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,459
Apollo says he'll be in Rocky's corner

280
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,560
at the fight rocky is a little wary of

281
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,600
that idea but Apollo says he didn't drag

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,250
his ass all the way out to the middle of

283
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,380
nowhere to not show his face in Moscow

284
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,140
this means everything to Apollo he wants

285
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,730
to show that even though Drago took

286
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,620
almost everything away from him he

287
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,690
couldn't kill his spirit we then get a

288
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,350
playful callback to a line

289
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,290
from earlier when this is over you know

290
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,110
me style you always think of something

291
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,820
else

292
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,590
[Music]

293
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,880
[Applause]

294
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,069
with Apollo there to help motivate rocky

295
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:08,959
the Italian stallion is in much better

296
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
spirits heading into his fight with a

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,490
Siberian Express instead of all anger

298
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,170
and revenge on the mind there's hope

299
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,329
optimism and something different to

300
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,550
prove Apollo entering the arena in

301
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,829
Moscow adds a whole other element to the

302
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,930
proceedings and fight rocky and Apollo

303
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,300
are both now the focus of the Soviet

304
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,220
hatred as they experience the jeers

305
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,259
together when Drago makes his way to the

306
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,540
ring we see glares from all three men

307
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,389
that confront the Soviet national anthem

308
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:36,980
is especially interesting with Apollo

309
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,990
present from here the focus shifts

310
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,029
completely to Rocky and Drago and the

311
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,160
fight begins as in the original movie

312
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Rocky is dominated by Drago for much of

313
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,839
the first and second round it's here

314
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,850
where things also change a bit we're

315
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,740
gonna have rocky get beaten up a little

316
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,990
more than we saw in the film Drago is

317
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,180
violently attacking early on this

318
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,220
triggers Apollo to grasp for the towel

319
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,139
as it's looking like Rocky is getting

320
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,300
seriously hurt but a POW is quick to

321
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,250
remember something that always set him

322
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:15,889
and rocky apart right then rocky lands

323
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,110
the shot that busts Drago open and the

324
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,720
fight is no longer a one-sided affair as

325
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,670
this battle goes on similar to the

326
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,529
original we're gonna go ahead and remove

327
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,810
the absurd crowd shift even in this

328
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,790
movie this audience going from cheering

329
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,130
Drago to relentlessly chanting rocky was

330
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,860
over-the-top ridiculous the environment

331
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,899
will still be very much pro-russia and

332
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,360
anti Rocky going into the final round it

333
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,189
is here where we get the final

334
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:42,680
inspirational push from Apollo he yells

335
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,300
up to his friend that rocky helped him

336
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,490
find another way to live and it took a

337
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,949
while but he sees that now his final

338
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:51,930
words are a mix of Tony's lines

339
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,570
[Applause]

340
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,130
as it happens in the real rocky for

341
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,380
Balboa goes out there and wins the fight

342
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,690
by a dramatic NACA Apollo they're

343
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,580
celebrating will make the moment even

344
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,440
sweeter and the Soviet crowd doesn't go

345
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,450
crazy for Rocky winning but at this

346
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,010
point he's earned enough respect with

347
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,100
them that he won't get 100% Boop Rocky's

348
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,230
ending speech as cheesy as it is can

349
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,240
still work here because it means more

350
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,700
having Apollo ringside rocky can make

351
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,370
eye contact with him and instead of I he

352
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,340
first says we if we can change

353
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,770
Apollo is clearly affected by Rocky's

354
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,720
words he celebrates outside the ring

355
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,550
with Adrian looking on at the Italian

356
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,350
stallion and his team soak up the moment

357
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,570
the Russian crowd will once again show

358
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,150
rocky respect as hearts on fire kicks in

359
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,220
for the last time and the credits roll

360
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,440
and there we have it what if Apollo

361
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Creed didn't die in rocky for in my

362
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,210
opinion it would have made for a much

363
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,370
stronger movie while continuing to build

364
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,650
Apollo as a remarkably well-rounded

365
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,540
secondary character how do these changes

366
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,890
affect rocky 5

367
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,840
what about Adonis Tommy Gunn and rocky

368
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
moving back to the old neighborhood

369
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,800
well I have a ton of ideas for that too

370
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
and maybe one day I'll go back to it I

371
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,490
also have to mention that the first

372
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,860
Creed movie largely fixed Apollo's death

373
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,960
for me it made it mean something more in

374
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,880
the legacy of the franchise and I think

375
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,010
Ryan Coogler did an amazing job with

376
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,620
that film this was a fun exercise to see

377
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,450
how rocky 4 could have been improved and

378
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,460
set up interesting alterations to the

379
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,530
sequels so what did you think want to

380
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,000
hear more about the genesis of this idea

381
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,220
and the details I had to leave out of

382
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,050
the video tune into the fan scription

383
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,120
podcast where I talk more about this

384
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,910
what if and dig deeper into why I did

385
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,950
what be on the lookout for more episodes

386
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,350
