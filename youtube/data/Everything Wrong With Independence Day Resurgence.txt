[Music]

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,049
mother logo overload when he thinks this

3
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,670
trip through CGI space is going to get

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,139
me excited about interstellar travel

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,759
when in fact all my future astronaut

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,020
sperm just tragically died of

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,700
disinterest it's a salient seeing the

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,410
president with more speech because this

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,240
future alien technology knows it wasn't

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,070
recorded right sitting up in bed after a

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,820
nightmare cliche

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,199
okay let's unpack this super

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,150
expositional nightstand shot first he's

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,920
reading about the German air force also

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,689
he has a cane so he's clearly old and

16
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,010
hobbled now third of all we have the

17
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,449
repeating doodles of a circle and it's

18
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,610
radius fancy pen fancy watch dell remote

19
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,229
control and a phone with more buttons

20
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,370
than the Starship Enterprise

21
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,239
I guess we're supposed to glean that

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,710
this former president is still obsessed

23
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,390
and being haunted by visions of a circle

24
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,799
with a line in it but mostly I'm just

25
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,330
concerned about that dell remote it's

26
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,010
upside down here so you have to work to

27
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,540
see the logo which you think would make

28
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,860
Dell less likely to pay for this

29
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,629
placement and yet here it is baffling

30
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:54,040
man I didn't even know Dell made remote

31
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,559
control devices for 20 years the world

32
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,140
to see no armed conflict nations have

33
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:07,000
put their petty differences aside these

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,070
Jumbotron screens are hovering Will

35
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,359
Smith has better things to do in the

36
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,590
scene you're the one that's bagged in

37
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,060
the White House it's too bad Mae Whitman

38
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,530
died and wasn't able to reprise her role

39
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,259
as Oh still alive still actively working

40
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,329
in Hollywood - wow this is awkward

41
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,859
liam hemsworth is in the moon vehicle

42
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,600
which might explain the break he and

43
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,189
Miley took in real life though you could

44
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:25,899
just as easily blame that pink armpit

45
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,340
hair phase she went through around the

46
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,450
time of this movie's events I mean

47
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,490
filming I was the youngest valedictorian

48
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,280
in the history of the Academy expose

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,049
Austin in case you confused it with one

50
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,210
of Jupiter's moons rather there are only

51
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,850
36 women on this moon base well that

52
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,380
number is worthless unless or until you

53
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,030
tell me how many men there are but movie

54
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,409
doesn't care about that it just wants to

55
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,880
slide in and I've been away a long time

56
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,399
and I'm who me joke movie expects me to

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,139
believe that this one tiny ship is going

58
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,369
to prevent this big thing from falling

59
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,319
and commanded by an inferior Hemsworth

60
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,210
no less engines are overheating but the

61
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,829
movie despite personally giving us that

62
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,210
information will ignore the consequences

63
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,249
of it you're grounded until further

64
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:01,749
notice what he means to say is you're

65
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:03,189
grounded until the aliens attack again

66
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,569
and we need an outside the box thinker

67
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,340
like yourself get me director Levinson

68
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,899
you mean that guy who did diner you

69
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,640
think he'd make this better I'm all for

70
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,530
it he's an original sign despite

71
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,060
commanding alien technology over the

72
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,040
last 20 years cellular service is still

73
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,340
spotty you need to

74
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,569
me seriously I've been chasing you

75
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,069
across the planet for three weeks now

76
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,440
excuse me who who are you again did this

77
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,730
guy just start yelling at David right

78
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,410
now halfway to their destination without

79
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,790
David even knowing who he is or why he's

80
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,160
here I mean this movie how holy they

81
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,569
dragged him for maniac into this movie

82
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:30,019
didn't they

83
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,250
she looks more uncomfortable in this

84
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,780
then she doesn't Antichrist and that

85
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,250
movie involved a scene in which scissors

86
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,660
were used in a manner that violate their

87
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,790
Terms of Use oh look the same basic

88
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,080
circle with a line doodle the former

89
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,640
president has been drawing a lot I bet

90
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
that means something despite the doodles

91
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,450
simplicity he's people for a grin war

92
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,400
with the aliens for ten years

93
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,930
a premise let is way better than this

94
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,340
whole movie but sure let's shoot this

95
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,030
one instead

96
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,910
it happened on its own two days ago and

97
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,950
now we get the Winnie that kick starts

98
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,630
the movie the ship turned its own lights

99
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,130
on the call is coming from inside the

100
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,840
house of course your wrath is the only

101
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,780
ship that landed in 96 total bull of

102
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,099
course the first movie made it look like

103
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,780
every ship crash landed and was on fire

104
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,220
after they destroyed the mothership but

105
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,989
sure this one managed to land on its own

106
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,400
and no one said about it they were

107
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,769
drilling I don't know

108
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,510
case closed then I guess visa we don't

109
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,950
know so it must be impossible to crack

110
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,780
20 years ago and we destroyed the

111
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,000
mothership we detected a burst in an

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
x-band frequency directed toward deep

113
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,799
space funny how we're only just now

114
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,329
hearing about that del paid good money

115
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,920
to have their laptop slams shut in

116
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,459
frustration

117
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,930
and an upside-down remote control shot

118
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,639
on the night stamp you're a pilot he's a

119
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,530
pilot the other guy's a pilot I'm giving

120
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,230
out wings international legacy squadron

121
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,579
also this movie just got a lot more

122
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,739
stealth than I think it intended Captain

123
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,190
Hillier

124
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,900
considering he died during a test flight

125
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,030
how do you feel taking off for the moon

126
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,799
man this reporter is the worst and the

127
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,030
screenwriters decided that Will Smith's

128
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,440
character died during a test flight

129
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,299
instead of from dating a stripper China

130
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,250
has been integral to the earth space

131
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,959
defense program amazing how helpful

132
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,519
China suddenly became and all the movies

133
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,780
released in the last few years

134
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,430
Jasmine took the rear career path from

135
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,169
exotic dancer to respected doctor in the

136
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,790
last one years and also of course she's

137
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,169
a doctor because we're in an Emmerich

138
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,910
movie so they're sending an elite squad

139
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,130
of eight pilots to the moon and that's

140
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,200
supposed to what I'm a guy I like pretty

141
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,940
girls but even I'm not comfortable with

142
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,500
how sexualized this girl's deep laning

143
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,090
ritual is this is the very definition of

144
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,919
the male gaze for a sexy pilot to

145
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:19,880
suddenly overcome with the urge to

146
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,530
excrete pheromones while standing inside

147
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,110
a jet

148
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,330
um can't they just not be related why is

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,810
ladies and gentlemen roland emmerich

153
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,340
pandering to the cheapest of human

154
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,199
emotions in the sleaziest of ways once

155
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,270
again please applaud jake decides to

156
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,530
watch the training video where he nearly

157
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,389
killed Dylan possibly realizing that an

158
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,740
unseen audience needs a backstory

159
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,389
brackish makes up for miss coma after

160
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,889
everything alien related in this movie

161
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,810
awoke from comas two days ago this just

162
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,310
came in from Hubble still using the

163
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,690
Hubble after mastering all that alien

164
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,159
technology huh didn't want to give the

165
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,840
James Webb telescope a shot out sure

166
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,639
it's not an operation yet but this is a

167
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,409
movie damn it up the alert level to red

168
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,509
to red alert then I'm calling Star Trek

169
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,130
on your ass listen I want you to pack up

170
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,840
your stuff and go to your sisters this

171
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,250
guy just got evidence there may be an

172
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,990
alien attack and he's the moon base

173
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,610
commander and his first move is to

174
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,229
selfishly call his own wife before

175
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,270
notifying any government types also how

176
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,680
does a moon base detect the Saturn

177
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
weirdness before Earth it's not that

178
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,469
much further out that it's measurably

179
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:15,969
closer to Saturn I feel like this whole

180
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,349
moon base is just a little too James

181
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,880
Bond II and stupid I know we're not on

182
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,650
good terms with aliens but that's racist

183
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,120
how did you suffer so much of their

184
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,650
language how did you determine he

185
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,479
deciphered anything from a one-second

186
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,250
glance at this wingdings board you must

187
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,259
be the pilot China sent that's your

188
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,699
opening line in addition to being lame

189
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,650
and obvious it's also kind of racist I

190
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,030
was wondering if you wanted to get a

191
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,949
drink maybe fall in love guys I think

192
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,240
the syn counter just died from that

193
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,680
pickup line we may need to manually

194
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,330
count sins with an abacus after this

195
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,580
take em out commander the sphere of

196
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,199
peace thing that just flew to our moon

197
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,849
to warn us about the aliens decided to

198
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:47,289
do so without trying to communicate with

199
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,699
us first or sending images of Hitler

200
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,500
just flew to our airspace and expected

201
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,569
the best all so sudden alien wormhole

202
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,279
ship thing sucks the dust off the moon

203
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,840
and everyone wants to shoot it except

204
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,490
Goldblum and in this instance I gotta

205
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,319
side with everyone but gold blue shoot

206
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,360
that bat of the sky now I don't care

207
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,289
that the movie will go on to show

208
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,550
Goldblum was probably right

209
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,529
use logic damn it they're coming back

210
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,930
and this time we won't be able to stop

211
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,849
this isn't Bill Pullman playing the

212
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,139
president from the last movie gone crazy

213
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,849
this is Bill Pullman the actor talking

214
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,409
about Emmerich and its production team I

215
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,930
will avenge it brother guessing your

216
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,159
brother died during the first movies

217
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,750
invasion but it's way more interesting

218
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,099
to think that stuff cheetah killed your

219
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,330
brother and that's why you killed and

220
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,830
stuffed it cuz any other explanation for

221
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,449
that stuff cheetah makes you a 100%

222
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,550
asshole I cannot root for FYI

223
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,870
well how do you think you're going

224
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,550
listen discount John Oliver he's clearly

225
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,199
going to space with that spaceship right

226
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,789
there and your question is unnecessary

227
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,680
or at least misguided why in georgia's

228
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,700
floyd everybody else is

229
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,620
awesome this character so fun what with

230
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,910
the constant whirring yelling in

231
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,600
exasperation

232
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
glad David decided to let him go on this

233
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,880
trip Independence Day to would like to

234
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,200
remind you how much David hates flying

235
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,540
and how much 2016 Jeff Goldblum hates

236
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,980
acting I'm actually glad no one is

237
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,510
buying this guy's book puts him in his

238
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,070
place you're the father of the guy not

239
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,450
the guy you should have written a book

240
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,160
about being the guy's father but no you

241
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,380
wrote this and now you suffer a former

242
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,700
president with full Secret Service

243
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,470
detail has escaped using the fake body

244
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,000
in the bed method because of course he

245
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,520
has that is that's the crash site thanks

246
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,940
David

247
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,230
all these people but where's the

248
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,730
humanity in this shot there's more

249
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,990
realism in The Adventures of Sharkboy

250
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
and Lavagirl 3d how did president want

251
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,710
more get past several levels of security

252
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,210
to even get this close to the current

253
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,980
president every alien invasion movie

254
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,180
these days makes it look like the moon

255
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,890
is always in some fixed positions that

256
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,390
aliens can visit just before they reach

257
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,670
Earth ships more than 3,000 miles in

258
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:31,930
Guyana that seems excessive I like a

259
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,130
space computer that repeats everything

260
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,750
it says it's helpful in case anyone

261
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,280
missed that first broadcast it's like

262
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,420
that yeah yeah science fiction

263
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,520
entertaining and useful movie replaces

264
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,140
original films landmark destruction

265
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,670
scenes with moon based destruction

266
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,260
scenes and I'm sorry just doesn't have

267
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,700
the impact if I'm honest I don't really

268
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,990
give a shit about the moment guy with

269
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,980
headphones can't hear or feel

270
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,360
destruction going on around him cliche

271
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,950
it's an Emmerich staple this guy is

272
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,750
really just shocked at how familiar all

273
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,850
this is Man of Steel how can this ship

274
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,470
with two main characters on it be so

275
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,940
close to the massive destruction without

276
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,950
being affected by it wait never mind I

277
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,510
think I answered my own question what

278
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,880
goes up must come down while I admit

279
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,230
Jeff Goldblum is good at saying cheesy

280
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,030
action lines like this what the fuck is

281
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,410
he talking about there's an alien ship

282
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,090
landing on earth that never went up but

283
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,950
merely came down on earth so what the

284
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,880
screenwriter

285
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,680
lazy much months before the brexit vote

286
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,750
London gets good and hard something

287
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,010
tells me this is only slightly more

288
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,720
impossible than John Cusack miraculous

289
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,880
drive in 2012 this scene could also be

290
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,680
accidentally cut into 2012 but I

291
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
wouldn't know the difference I'd like to

292
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,860
get the landmarks even when the movie is

293
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,210
being self-aware it somehow ends up

294
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,010
being wrong this is clearly incidental

295
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,480
damage from all the other three going on

296
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,830
but let's laugh it up about how the

297
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,690
aliens are landmark racist take your

298
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,450
path yeah yeah me too all five

299
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,070
screenwriters on this film collectively

300
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,630
high-fived over the pee pants joke

301
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,800
because it was righteous in its

302
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,990
originality and hilariousness better

303
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,310
come and see this you better come and

304
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,020
see this okay here's judd hirsch has

305
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,520
failed author character cooking a steak

306
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,500
on a boat named after a Madonna song

307
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,300
the Atlantic just in time to be in the

308
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,650
center of the action because we all

309
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,970
loved him so much in the first movie

310
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,140
this will surely make us forget Will

311
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,060
Smith rejected this turd rain you take

312
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,630
the lead

313
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,400
I gotta see about someone because that's

314
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,990
how the military works

315
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,760
Dylan flies back to the hospital just in

316
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,110
time to witness how much of a failure he

317
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,420
is it's saving his mom and she's dead so

318
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,400
the question is did Vivica Fox ask for

319
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,660
too much money did the screenwriters

320
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,590
only just get out of character

321
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,300
motivations 101 does roland emmerich

322
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,250
hate strippers turn doctors yeah Judd

323
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,720
Hirsch is basically Jesus in this boat

324
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm no longer remotely worried about his

325
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,930
chances of survival he's untouchable

326
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,340
luckily for brackish he decided to

327
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,870
escape his room at just the moment when

328
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,340
President Widmore arrived to open up the

329
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,170
alien prison the other all the systems

330
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,480
the depressed deranged former president

331
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,190
overrode your modern-day security system

332
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,900
this movie is aggressively stupid well

333
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,730
now apparently the pronoun game spans

334
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,890
across the universe I feel like this is

335
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,600
some sort of metaphor where analog kills

336
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
digital this is independent state to so

337
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,710
probably not just shut up okay that's

338
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,280
enough

339
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,870
I feel like this movie almost certainly

340
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,400
already showed me these underage driving

341
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,320
melodramatic teens and yet this still

342
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,490
feels like the first time I'm seeing

343
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,050
them and I hate them I think they're

344
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,670
after our molten core

345
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,020
yeah but maybe they're trying to save

346
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,430
humanity and get the earth spinning

347
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,380
again like in the classic 2003 film the

348
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,060
core also I guess there are no other

349
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,380
good heat sources and the nearby solar

350
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,870
systems like Suns and totally after the

351
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,070
molten core you nailed it dude

352
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,390
interesting that he's looking at a

353
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,740
family photo in which the kid in the

354
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,630
picture is not him and it will Smith get

355
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,650
a 10 million dollar photograph

356
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,780
appearance fee for this movie couldn't

357
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,920
save her too late

358
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,440
I wasn't cheeky enough this red mass on

359
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,390
the top of the ship that's your target

360
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,130
it's exactly the same but it's not in

361
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,480
any way like the Death Star's weakness

362
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,070
we're gonna send a fleet of drones to go

363
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,360
in ahead of you and disable their

364
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,830
shields makes you think you have the

365
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,360
technology to disable their shields

366
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,820
fourth of July wait those fuckin aliens

367
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,589
waited 20 years and then attacked earth

368
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,440
on the same calendar days before

369
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
stupid-ass aliens Jesus she's happy

370
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,589
because she's one of those pilots before

371
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,060
they all took off and now that thing is

372
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,460
no longer after few so now this plasma

373
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,720
drill will take forever to cut down to

374
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,040
the Earth's core even though it clearly

375
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,930
has none of the earthly limitations I

376
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,370
did when I tried to shovel my way down

377
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,620
to it

378
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,360
come and we have visible only just now

379
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,370
how does any ship avoid being hit by

380
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,990
these things seriously there's so much

381
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,400
junk on this screen it's like playing

382
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
that old Genesis game target earth that

383
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,670
was impossible unless you put in a cheat

384
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,960
code and loaded the cartridge into a

385
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,350
toaster liam hemsworth and Will Smith's

386
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,760
son collaborate to take out a single

387
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,470
alien ship and are left alone by

388
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,970
everyone to do that despite there being

389
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,950
like ten times the alien ships in this

390
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,990
airspace as Earth ships whatever cool

391
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,850
movie moment watch it be damned everyone

392
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,110
you should be dead is what I'm saying I

393
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,120
think we need to fly inside to be even

394
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,210
more like Star Wars sir she knows coming

395
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,680
yeah cuz she looked at her front window

396
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,330
look if you're gonna give this guy a

397
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,680
connection to the aliens can you at

398
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,240
least make him spew something not super

399
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,000
obvious it's a trap a trap for what why

400
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,560
would you lead these pilots in here only

401
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,090
to disable their jets do they need a

402
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,800
live humans for some reason I don't

403
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,310
think they do

404
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,690
which makes this it's a trap scene

405
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,610
pretty pointless well there goes HBO

406
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,010
again she baited us yeah she attacked

407
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,780
you and you counter-attack but she was

408
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,130
ready for it she's a regular Bobby

409
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,810
Fischer aliens are attacking the space

410
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,070
and the doors are being forcefully

411
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,690
opened and yet no one has tried to take

412
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,520
madam president anywhere safe she's

413
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,690
basically closer to the doors than

414
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,940
anyone in the room even all members of

415
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,680
the presidential line of succession are

416
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,060
presumed dead and buried I swear you

417
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,710
want to sir well isn't that convenient

418
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,570
every member of the presidential line of

419
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,190
succession luckily this character is

420
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,660
being played by William Fichtner have a

421
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,060
little faith you want to talk about

422
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,950
faith watching Joey King bitch out judd

423
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,630
hirsch for using colloquialisms during

424
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,340
an alien invasion is not anywhere near

425
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,900
my list of things I want to see because

426
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,570
I am NOT rolling ever thank you God why

427
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,610
if the two right lanes are so backed up

428
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,290
people are outside their vehicles is

429
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,630
this left lane so wide open I live in

430
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,980
America dammit and I know for a fact

431
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,390
this third Lane would be backed up too

432
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,070
and there'd be ten makeshift lanes on

433
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,450
the fields on either side it would also

434
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,130
be backed up this planet has been

435
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,620
unified in a way that John precedent in

436
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,330
human history movie thinks it's going to

437
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,740
give Bill Pullman another rousing speech

438
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,330
moment but realizes Bill Pullman will

439
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,770
only ever be allowed to have one of

440
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,270
those in his lifetime dude is giving a

441
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,680
motivational speech to one guy but

442
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,000
others take notice and begin closing in

443
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,830
to hear the rest of a cliche

444
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,740
to me is our line look if you're gonna

445
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,750
bring alien vs. predator into this we've

446
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,890
lowered the bar to the point where we're

447
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,060
not even high jumping anymore we're

448
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,320
curling here's where the movie had a

449
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,910
great opportunity to be an awesome alien

450
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,860
sci-fi film having American pilots

451
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,540
fighting in the alien ecosystem that is

452
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,700
located entirely on this huge ship but

453
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,140
instead the movie totally glosses over

454
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,430
this is something they need to get away

455
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,750
from rather than bathing

456
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,860
how long can Earthlings hold their

457
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,540
breath underwater on an alien space god

458
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,950
dammit I am NOT even gonna finish that

459
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,900
sentence movie can Daryl lick my balls

460
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,880
also Independence Day Goblet of Fire

461
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,680
this dumbass touches an alien sphere

462
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,240
without anyone seeing it before it's too

463
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
late and it just so happens to be the

464
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,480
thing that opens this booking speeder I

465
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,850
mean damn it my species shed our

466
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,430
biological existence for a virtual one

467
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,980
thousands of years ago so your species

468
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,050
is a bunch of Lucy's then I came to

469
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,020
evacuate as many of you as possible but

470
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,400
instead of simply speaking English to

471
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,510
you right away and giving you this

472
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,040
awesome warning I needed to show up to

473
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,450
your moon base like an idiot and get

474
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,940
myself shot up first tracted it's molten

475
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,360
core they use them to refuel their ships

476
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,120
and grow their technology don't ask how

477
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,590
they do that with a core that is mostly

478
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,420
iron nickel alloy it's terrifying and

479
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,730
super cool the system holds the key to

480
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,890
superior technology that's why you lost

481
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,020
right I mean they beat you you said

482
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,460
you're the sole survivor why would I

483
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,500
believe your tech is superior and there

484
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,140
is a hidden planet where I teach

485
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,210
refugees from other fallen worlds how to

486
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,910
build weapons that will defeat them so

487
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,230
there's a hidden planet that somehow

488
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,180
magically appears to refugees as a flee

489
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,010
their planet and once they land on said

490
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,330
planet they're told to go find a sphere

491
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,100
she knows what to do next I mean there

492
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,060
are so many questions that will be

493
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,290
answered by this movie because it thinks

494
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,940
it's getting another sequel but now that

495
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,640
I am activated the Queen will detect my

496
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,430
signature and hunt me down maybe you

497
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,690
should have sent an instruction manual

498
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,490
first before coming here if we hide the

499
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,310
real sphere inside the isolation chamber

500
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,840
this spheres frequency can be read from

501
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,400
space how much can an isolation chamber

502
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,830
really do filled with cold fusion bombs

503
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,430
and lure her out to the soft flats kuna

504
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,800
ear movie you set off cold fusion bombs

505
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,630
you're gonna kill everyone from here to

506
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,700
Houston not if we use the shield

507
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,380
generators from this base to containment

508
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,000
laughs well I checked out an hour ago

509
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,620
but this sounds suspiciously like both

510
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,650
to me we were wrong we do not have seven

511
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,280
hours until the earth core breach

512
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,160
we only have one what a shocker the

513
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,570
professional estimators in a roland

514
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,920
emmerich movie were way off on their

515
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,510
predictions and the danger is a lot more

516
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,520
imminent I'll fly it in now you won't

517
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,170
president Whitmore got ready for this

518
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,370
just in time to crush his daughter's

519
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,260
dreams of being a hero Julius finds a

520
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,790
magic bus that the driver abandoned

521
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,990
right when the station wagon was about

522
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,560
to run out of gas

523
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,900
excuse me down here there you go

524
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,550
this movie saw guardians of the galaxy

525
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,440
loved star-lord but failed to learn

526
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,330
anything about story or originality in

527
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,770
the process so we end up with this bolt

528
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,690
while Jake does this can I ask again

529
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,190
what the point of this trap was they

530
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,570
basically allow the ships in and

531
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,100
everyone realized oh no it's a trap and

532
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,210
that sounded like something really

533
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,830
really bad to what end

534
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,180
they could have simply not trapped these

535
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,920
guys and shot them down outside easily

536
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,420
the aliens didn't need anything from

537
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,650
them so this trap is totally worthless

538
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,660
just technology hasn't changed at all

539
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,920
interface

540
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,060
sounds like that's a change in

541
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,130
technology then doesn't it also amazing

542
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,330
after the first movie that the aliens

543
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,980
didn't advocate locking technology for

544
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,750
their ships or require a password or

545
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,490
alien DNA or anything that will prevent

546
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,650
humans from using a man I just want you

547
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,440
to know you'll make it out of here this

548
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,850
is a cliche but I don't have the

549
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,080
strength to write out the whole thing

550
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,310
I'm just hoping you feel me on this one

551
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:13,940
this is radios okay first of all how

552
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,350
would you know that it's the world

553
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,120
shortwave radio message board still

554
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,260
operating during this super obvious

555
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,940
alien invasion second of all why would

556
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,740
you say this even if it's true are you

557
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,000
trying to tell the aliens how to find

558
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,080
your listeners or language I mean I'm

559
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,339
kind of assuming you won't speak English

560
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,900
here otherwise good luck

561
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,210
yesterday he collapsed come with me

562
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,160
quick this dad is a Kurt and if you

563
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,330
didn't realize Bill Pullman was gonna

564
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,530
die in this movie probably while

565
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,850
sacrificing himself to save the planet

566
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,410
then you don't watch movies very often

567
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,480
it's good to see you flying again okay

568
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,130
first of all saying this instead of I'm

569
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,050
sorry I lied to you five minutes ago it

570
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,880
places in the air like you would know

571
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,770
terrible father yet the movie felt the

572
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,300
need to recreate the sacrificial plane

573
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,800
flying into the alien ship scene from

574
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,520
the first movie

575
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,960
because roland emmerich only has like

576
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,820
two ideas max and those two ideas

577
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,220
keeping and producing inbred child ideas

578
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,110
that are somehow even worse well if she

579
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,970
said why fighters till

580
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,530
to us this gal would be excellent at

581
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,150
cinemasins but terrible at cliche

582
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,860
screenwriting there has to be a second

583
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,559
whammy duh yep

584
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,539
all-powerful alien Queens hold grudges

585
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,010
just like you and me somebody's asshole

586
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,020
dogs in danger cliche it feels like this

587
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,370
alien should have easily caught up to

588
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,809
the bus and destroyed it by now or were

589
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,339
these ships trying to blow up the alien

590
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,959
should have destroyed the bus by now we

591
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,120
are within six minutes actually nine but

592
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,380
you couldn't possibly know the movie

593
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,970
with the stor time to suit its needs but

594
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,780
good ticking clock narration dude can

595
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,429
come on movie how much bullshit you

596
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,440
expect me to swallow like all of it I do

597
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,210
have a gag reflex you know is there ever

598
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,320
going to be a realization from these

599
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,370
pilots that they're shooting is it

600
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:47,059
working Oh what did the shield lose its

601
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,710
maximum amount of hit points thank god

602
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,240
this video game has been boring and

603
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,890
confusing by the way why is the alien

604
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,390
queen so intent to destroy the school

605
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,190
bus and Patricia isn't the mission for

606
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,659
her to find the sphere why does she care

607
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,460
so much about these assholes this alien

608
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,780
queen is so motivated by flashes of

609
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,950
anger it's a wonder she ever got this

610
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,630
far and our earth takeover attempt how

611
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,440
much you wanted that Liam Hemsworth

612
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,929
saved her ass like all the dollars I got

613
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,450
- very well he just ruined my back she

614
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,280
lets a second guitar of our system this

615
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,330
is where movies officially make you

616
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,190
angry these assholes flew out of the

617
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,929
mothership 15 minutes ago but did the

618
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,400
alien queen want to take control then

619
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,289
nope just allow them to fly out no

620
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,789
problem what about when these ships were

621
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,470
firing at her a minute ago nope

622
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,059
just allow them the time to save not Mae

623
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,950
Whitman then control it these guys have

624
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,480
no manual controls and the alien ships

625
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,919
they stole then they turn on the fusion

626
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
thrusters manually mind you and

627
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,650
amazeballs

628
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,179
I gotta controls back make up controls

629
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,390
back Big Town if this movie just steal

630
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,250
from Independence Day and aliens while

631
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,630
taking Close Encounters of the Third

632
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,740
Kind name in vain

633
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,240
nice gag but his hands are both on the

634
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,130
wheel and these wipers just turned on so

635
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,809
that's some magic bull or else he's got

636
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,039
a child under the dashboard where we

637
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,390
can't see that's just turned on the

638
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,559
wipers which raises even more questions

639
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,570
and none of these crashing alien ships

640
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,159
landed on anything or anyone important

641
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,679
the end the marriage you trying to shoot

642
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,900
me this joke is unfunny what's worse is

643
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,980
that it's actually kind of offensive

644
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,480
casually suggesting violence is

645
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,280
commonplace in marriages but mostly it's

646
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,140
unfunny yes let's let all the little

647
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,909
school children get super up close to

648
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,110
the we think she's dead but we don't

649
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,700
know for sure alien queen and her

650
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,380
dripping bodily fluids Jesus

651
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,789
10 years after this here in Brockovich

652
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,200
takes David and his dad for all they're

653
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,940
worth in a vicious yet just class-action

654
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,830
lawsuit on behalf of these kids who all

655
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,779
developed Neptune pneumonia

656
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,059
you guys should stay with me for a while

657
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,580
but we'd really like that what the pink

658
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,440
movie this is some kind of prequel to

659
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,840
lovely bones or something I mean old man
