this game with me it's called patently

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,759
stupid what it does is we create a bunch

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,799
of problems and then we draw a solution

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,750
to it and then poop jokes ensue dick

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,150
jokes ensue all sorts of immature humor

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,189

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,399
is packed with future millionaires yeah

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,860
now everybody knows the best inventions

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,860
solve big problems and to identify those

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,840
big problems we'll need to do a little

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,329
market research on your device you're

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,460
going to receive to fill in the blank

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,420
prompts type in anything at all now your

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,320
problems getting sent to the other

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,840
attendees to inspire their creative

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,570
masterpieces so let's get to it I think

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,350
there's something about these

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,610
announcements that just makes this game

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,210
hilarious

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,080
just the way they inflect things some

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,400
other people that are watching we're

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,369
just filling in the blanks here but your

34
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,750
ethics might be getting in the way of a

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,130
good idea I've always thought that

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,689
ethics needed to go out the window when

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:35,340
we're playing things like this simply

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:44,460
pick the one you want to solve where you

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,649
bring your designs to life using nothing

40
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,590
but a pen and paper okay ran out of

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,030
paper so you'll have to use some

42
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,970
cocktail napkins okay and don't forget

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,460
to spice it up with a little color all

44
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,119
right okay I'm ready for this okay I got

45
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,820
it I got it guys and I'm trying to avoid

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,100
the the default strategy of mine which

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,990
is just to put dicks into everything

48
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,119
that I do so I'm hoping that I can kind

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,000
of avoid that as much as I possibly can

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,120
okay so now let's bring it all home give

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,590

greatness

109
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,849
you'll need to acquire $1200 in capital

110
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,460
to not only fund your invention but also

111
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,580
net yourself a 500 dollar funding bonus

112
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,030
in a successful invention and get double

113

to call

168
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,820
yeah that sounds great but what does it

169
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,700
look like well take a look silly but

170
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,160
Lina won't forget about this in five

171
00:13:44,160 --> 00:14:00,720
minutes it sure will and that's how it's

172
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,010
done everybody funny that's not funny

173
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,540
that's not funny

174
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:33,330
I sure do Lina that'll be stuck in my

175
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:41,880
head for days darn straight just stop

176
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:54,270
doing well but what's it look like take

177
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:02,240
a look for yourself in my head for days

178
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,110
that's the idea

179
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:15,870
and scene you can't bring this on pal

180
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,630
she called me anyways long story short

181
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,460
okay don't give me that look okay okay

182
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,940

186
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,430

189
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,410
this looks great Lina but without a tag

190
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,040
line I'm afraid I just won't remember

191
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,860

198
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,910
what's it look like well take a look

199

my brain is bad I can only remember

201
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:39,240
things that have a tag line stuck in my

202
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:49,350
head for days that's the idea great job

203

00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,220
only remember things that have a catchy

218
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,540
tagline

like this actually tried to make a

238
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,929
product and not focus on the actual sake

like well take a look silly Lena but

244
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,920
without a tagline I'm afraid I just

245
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,520
won't remember it well you're in luck

246

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,250

Grande provides her own milk and cookies

253
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,620
I thought I was gonna I couldn't breathe

254
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,090
for a second there and I know that

255
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,070
suggests that I'm a horrible person but

256
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,540
I literally legitimately couldn't

257
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:40,950
breathe mine is the best one it's

258
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,950
legitimate it has almost nothing to do

259
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,720
with the penis okay it might have

260
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,280
everything to do with a penis it might

261
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,740
actually be completely 100% penis it

262
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,050
might actually be 200% penis now that I

263
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,910
think about this but but wait you'll see

264
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,360
you'll see what I got going on it's

266
00:22:00,210 --> 00:23:14,370
problem sure do I don't think anyway I'd

267
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,990
like to think that I'm the best with

268
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,820
coming up with the taglines I think

269
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:35,210
that's my strong penis attack with that

281

problem I have I'm perfectly happy with

this

288
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,690
oh that's amazing but Lena my brain is

289
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,180
bad I can only remember things that have

290
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:20,150
a catchy tagline that'll be stuck in my

291
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:27,470
head for days hey thank you I'd like to

292
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,060
think there's no bias in that it's my

293
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,800
artistic abilities really got it through

294
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,530

297
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,660
a pick it okay I got one I'm not proud

298
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,070
of what I picked but I picked it okay I

299
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,070
did one that wasn't horribly gross I did

300
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,320
one that wasn't horribly grandma has

301
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,780
nothing not my phone this has nothing to

302
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,570
do with Grandma I've got a very clever

303
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,700
idea and I'm I don't know I keep wanting

304
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,350
to hop up on my stool I think it's just

305
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,030
a instinctive thing to be taller

306
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:12,750
[Laughter]

307
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,730
why do I make myself laugh I don't know

308
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,740
I'm so sorry I'm such a loser I make

309
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,660
myself laugh more than anybody makes me

310
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,120
laugh but I'm like Ethan there's no one

311
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,960
that makes me laugh harder than my own

312
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,240
prep everybody hurry up okay hurry up

313
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,210
you're a on time pay and out of time I

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,150

well have I got just the thing for you

316
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,900
it's just a little thing called yeah

317
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,419
that sounds great but what does it look

318
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:56,679
like take a look for yourself in the

319
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:15,250
toilet and scene the problem Jelena but

320
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:24,970
sure do it's simply called my prayers

321
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,130
have been answered but what's it look

322
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,429
like

323
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,340
glad you asked point your peepers at

324
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:42,680
this

325
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,630
[Laughter]

326
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:55,630
and that's how it's done everybody it's

327
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:20,620
just a little thing called darn straight

328
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,990
and see we done what have we done

329
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,690
tie him up and force him to watch I

330
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,160
think that's the opposite of the
