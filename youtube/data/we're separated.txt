here

86
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,360
the bad thing you don't have to speak or talk to or interact with a human being

87
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,640
when you rent a car that's how everything should be okay

88
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,169
and this is not an endorsement of Hertz rental far as you sort of have to deal

89
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,939

94
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,329
it wasn't my fault no okay

95
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,370
it's okay I've always wanted to go over the spike things

96
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
there is my lucky day yeah they see this

97
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,110

99
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,680

100
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,100
that'll pop the time oh it's not all right

101
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,010
i should say this on the other side

102
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,000
no one else sees the humor in this but I think it's pretty funny

103
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,810
the gate also crashed on the car look at this mark

104
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,760
this happen before

105
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,740
you can have it

106
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:45,910
how does that happen before and they don't fix it you would think that all

107
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,870
right

108
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,590
