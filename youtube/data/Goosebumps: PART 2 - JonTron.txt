affect the RAM disk this one starts off

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,780
with our main character Larry boys

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,670
running from a bunch of dogs and having

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,040
some life-changing inner monologue right

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,860
away leave me alone dumb dogs I can't

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,969
put my finger on it but there's

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,770
something really unsettling about this

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,770
whole thing hear me wheezing it's

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:16,170
because I had these stupid a real

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,660
journey nah come on you're being too

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,680
hard on yourself it's not having me try

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,330
and get me now

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,630
so much for the bright side

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,250
[Music]

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,150
I really do wish it ended there nice

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,860
doggies go home doggies here that's Lily

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,650
my best friend she's pretty cool you

34
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,520
know for a girl what is that supposed to

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,650
mean that's not in the book the mention

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,850
of Lily in the introduction is that

37
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,100
she's small and cute not about how she's

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,640
cool for a girl the best part about this

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,800
is that you know an adult wrote this

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,960
script that kid had nothing to do with

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,430
this when the cameras cut he was

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,960
probably like are you sure we should say

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,220
that hey Larry

44
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,190
you're pretty cool for a girl too what's

45
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,170
that supposed to mean John I wish I knew

46
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,110
what's up with those dogs

47
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,300
maybe they smell your fear I would know

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,160
since I got mauled by them

49
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,560
gee thanks like I needed to hear that Oh

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,430
Larry you're just a you're a fucking

51
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,300
asshole

52
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,830
so Larry goes off to roll his eyes

53
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,470
Simona the shitty GarageBand this kid is

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,550
best thing ever

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,350
they find some tanning lotion and

56
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,260
larious just just really goddamn happy

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:52,110
about that my god the actors in this

58
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,150
episode have an uncanny ability to make

59
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,620
their voice and face look as

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,120
disconnected as possible

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,940
so next Larry goes home and expositions

62
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,800
the shit out of his I think it was that

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,440
made me feel sick but I can't tell mom

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,270
and dad they kill me they know I was

65
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,760
using some old stuff like them he then

66
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,260
stumbles upon the discovery that he's

67
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,730
growing excess hair where he applied the

68
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,010
tanning lotion so then he goes to the

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:26,550
bathroom to remove it and just - are you

70
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,180
almost done in there oh well could you

71
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,270
just hand me out my razor can I get some

72
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:41,459
privacy that's like the joke voice

73
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,320
people do when they're trying to pretend

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,239
to act natural

75
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:54,900
can I get some fries so after all that

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,940
Larry catches up with Lily and talks to

77
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,620
her about his strange experience the

78
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,170
night prior did you notice anything last

79
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,170
night where you rub that instant tan on

80
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,750
I mean like in revolving hair I don't

81
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,920
like where this is going

82
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,470
I mean hair you know like where you

83
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,200
don't expect to see it are you growing

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,419
from I expected hair no are you no are

85
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,239
you no I just thought maybe you know

86
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,880
what growing hair in weird places FBI

87
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,450
should be not gonna store any minute now

88
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,990
hairy Larry okay

89
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,570
so um after that painfully horrifying

90
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,550
conversation happens they go to see

91
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,230
their friend who isn't even home in fact

92
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,150
so they decide to go up to his room to

93
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,720
do some investigating

94
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,570
clothes are still here is that really

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,110
relevant at all

96
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,540
so this creepy realtor guy tells them

97
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,860
that man has moved out and is

98
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,960
unnecessarily creepy for no reason at

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,580
all so at this point in the story Larry

100
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,780
is basically just going from place to

101
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,250
place trying to hide his hair from

102
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,430
people and being embarrassed and you

103
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,680
can't piss on hospitality I won't allow

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,030
it

105
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,310
where's the bathroom

106
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,330
are you okay Larry I decided I better

107
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,410
get out of here

108
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,630
any way I could

109
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,230
be right there what's for dessert

110
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,430
dessert was that lame or what no Mac

111
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,660
it's a pretty normal thing to say

112
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,880
honestly so he escapes homework through

113
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,390
some dogs and I had to check and see if

114
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,950
there was hair growing anywhere else on

115
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,900
my chest please later you'll understand

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,610
I'm on my back you don't know what

117
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:53,300
you're doing here now naturally Larry's

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,860
parents are wondering what the fuck is

119
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,480
up with Larry so they call the doctor to

120
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,160
check him out I don't think the tanning

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,540
lotion and anything to do with it

122
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,760
really that's not likely oh it's

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,520
probably some sort of skin irritation

124
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,610
yes Larry has a band audition coming up

125
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,380
yes yes

126
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,290
yes that's probably it now where did I

127
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,750
put that MD eventually Larry starts

128
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,100
connecting the dots and comes to the

129
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,870
conclusion that the kids disappearances

130
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,860
are linked to them turning into dogs he

131
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,450
goes around town talking a bunch of

132
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,300
stock vague adults my favorite kind of

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,480
them listen to what I'm telling you

134
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,850
there is no Lily yes there is them

135
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,050
forget about her

136
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,060
let's go be difficult but the great must

137
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,310
always fall he gets fed up with his lack

138
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,110
of detective skills and makes it known

139
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,660
how about you roast beef I don't want

140
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,870
food I want answers

141
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,370
god damn it Larry you're hard to love

142
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,190
was your heart it ain't what were my mom

143
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,680
and dad hiding could Lily really be a

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,860
dog

145
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,569
[Music]

146
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:06,520
I think I'm gonna keep going after that

147
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,009
can't do that and yes he was a dog and

148
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,550
so was everyone else they were dogs more

149
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,080
all the stories real good on this one

150
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,319
it's up don't be unlucky and be a dog

151
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,509
all right this is Halloween after all

152
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,270
and after all Halloween is a scary

153
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,550
so it's time to take a look at the final

154
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,770
chapter of our little goosebumps saga

155
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,110
I thought those last two were bad honey

156
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,719
those were Citizen Kane Casablanca in

157
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,029
relation to this butchering of an oral

158
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,300
Stine classic West but certainly not

159
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,039
best wolf speech well third one's

160

things you stupid bitch okay first I was

169
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,249
kind of advocating for you who's used to

170
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:14,479
being a dick for no reason thought you

171
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,619
were the victim but not I can basically

172
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,119
see that you're both pretentious fucks

173
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,039
so pretty immediately they get startled

174
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,749
by some stranger kids who live nearby

175
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:26,930
oh god it's Whoopi Goldberg best one

176
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,439
ever

177
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,409
did you say Jack we've been watching you

178
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,329
guys okay so that's not creepy at all

179
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:34,099
we're staying with Brad and Agatha our

180
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,319
fourth cousins twice your model removed

181
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:40,459
Jerry twice removed keep Romano

182
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:43,039
it's much better now if I just have to

183
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,839
say my favorite thing about this episode

184
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,939
is the acting chops on that creepy girl

185
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,130
I could see you this morning heading out

186
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,259
for the graveyard so we thought we'd

187
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,939
give you a little scare from these

188
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:55,279
strange kids Jerry and Terry learn of a

189
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,380
ghost named Harrison Sadler that

190
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,180
allegedly still roams the area

191
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,020
is dead but he still walks the night and

192
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,460
just like that before you know it they

193
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,510
do that thing where they just start

194
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,130
acting spooky out of nowhere and say

195
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,600
they gotta go get Jerry a little more of

196
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:16,750
that

197
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,140
oh I sure will Brad isn't that making me

198
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,940
really uncomfortable wait a sec didn't

199
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,530
they say these were their fourth cousins

200
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,810
twice removed who so nice your folks

201
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,910
brought you up here to be with your own

202
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,640
cousins is that how that works I'm not a

203
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,780
scholar but these look more like

204
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,880
grandparents to me like I said

205
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,590
disclaimer I'm not a schooler so

206
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,150
everything's going great and everyone's

207
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,770
happy that is of course until they bring

208
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,180
up the kids they met on the beach Sam

209
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,250
and Louisa we met some other Sadler's

210
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:49,240
today kids a salmon Louisa

211
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,999
nice kids I just love dinner scenes like

212
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,529
this where everything's going great and

213
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,269
then someone says something that cues in

214
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,610
the unsettling music and everyone

215
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,170
suddenly becomes distant and mysterious

216
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,069
like they've never even known each other

217
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:09,459
some ghost in a cave oh I got some

218
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,240
reading to do excuse me you'll help jack

219
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,009
quick I need your help reading this or I

220
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:16,779
won't be able to do it in time I want to

221
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,189
find out where in this classic book

222
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,079
series RL Spain said you wanted to show

223
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,830
to me written by a bunch of chimpanzees

224
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,500
[Music]

225
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,330
it doesn't say anywhere some kinds of

226
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,040
see what you can actually it's full of

227
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,060
iodine bugs I wish I had a book on all

228
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,740
the different types of seaweed I didn't

229
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,570
even think it was possible to sound like

230
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,130
that much of a bitch talking about

231
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,150
seaweed Congrats good man this girl

232
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,860
could make Gandhi sound pretentious

233
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,350
Gerry takes a nice trip and finds a

234
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,140
skeleton laying on the beach skeleton of

235
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,320
what yeah a raccoon on the beach smaller

236
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,700
every single time they show that

237
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,350
skeleton again they use that Chuck

238
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,690
stingers sound the bones are picked

239
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,550
clean what kind of animal would do

240
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,920
something like this I guess if you're

241
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,040
going to be around here you should know

242
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,840
it wasn't an animal that beat those

243
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:29,260
bones clean it wasn't ghosts always bark

244
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:38,230
to warn about goes oh

245
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,300
the ghost lives up there first of all

246
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,720
why did she turn backwards 270 degrees

247
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,400
instead of easier 90 that's white

248
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,070
alright let's keep on going right over

249
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,750
close to the end god damnit I'm gonna

250
00:11:53,750 --> 00:12:04,670
enjoy this Halloween if it kills me but

251
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,740
that's okay just think about how I feel

252
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,750
next time maybe Jerry then spots of

253
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,980
light and the cavern where Harrison

254
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,320
Sadler is supposed to be and they once

255
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,940
again bring this knowledge back to their

256
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,040
relatives cousin grandpa tries to

257
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,840
explain it away using aurora borealis

258
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,450
but the kids just aren't buying it you

259
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,480
have you ever hear of aurora borealis

260
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,670
German oh yeah it happened certain times

261
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,770
in here or something electric gets in

262
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,810
the air and the whole sky lights up and

263
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,140
streamers bullshit grandpa at this point

264
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,910
we know something fishy is going on

265
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,740
Jerry scares Terry like this for no

266
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,160
reason and it's decided between them to

267
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,870
go out to the cave for a grand adventure

268
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,810
to put this mystery to rest once and for

269
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:51,430
all and let me go to sleep tonight and

270
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,650
here is where we finally come face to

271
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,320
face with the ghosts of Harrison said

272
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,080
that's not a ghost

273
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,670
there's not a ghost at all that's a guy

274
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,280
it's dangerous to get involved with

275
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,550
ghosts ghosts I don't like nothing

276
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,300
personal

277
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,250
it's just a cultural thing I think I'm a

278
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,330
ghost don't you oh I want

279
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,170
goes alright but I got my eyes on you I

280
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,240
saw your grace and ancestors not mine

281
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,060
bullshit if the Gulf I'm going to tell

282
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,800
you a story and I want you to listen

283
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,140
very carefully in the year 61

284
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,660
I love exposition so the totally not

285
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,240
ghosts of Harrison Sadler explains that

286
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,610
300 years ago pilgrims sailed to this

287
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,770
very location but when they got here

288
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,390
they were faced with a terrible winter

289
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,640
and bare bones living conditions and

290
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,710
their deaths were so unbearably painful

291
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,600
that they stayed here as ghosts like you

292
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,760
I told you I studied ghosts I'm not a

293
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,180
ghost like me specifically I am NOT a

294
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,220
ghost but I've taken many courses and

295
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,870
ghosts and I'm decently interested in

296
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,390
ghosts but I am definitely not a ghost

297
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,550
and any information you find that may

298
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,070
lead you to believe that I am a ghost

299
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,610
that is wrong trust me you're too young

300
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,240
friends our family's dead but three

301
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,100
centuries never studied them oh okay I'm

302
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,350
King he tells them to go up to the

303
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,390
graveyard to find their answer which

304
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,980
apparently they just do because it's

305
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,140
after some searching they find the

306
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,810
gravestones of Louisa and Samuel the two

307
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,880
strange kids on the beach yeah but it's

308
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,320
okay it's probably misunderstanding

309
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,580
they're probably just more distant

310
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,150
relatives superior that goes clever you

311
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,170
think we're the ghosts

312
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,480
where do these go

313
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,180
our ancestors which is gotten into

314
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,060
actually oh my god they actually use

315
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,230
that excuse again good they may be good

316
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,270
ghosts but they're certainly not good

317
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,970
Liars so Sam and Louisa show Terry and

318
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,410
Terry their own graves

319
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,820
for some reason I don't I don't even

320
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,160
know at this point damn in Terry Scrooge

321
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,640
this is your fate you don't go back to

322
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,800

326
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,140
that's Grimm's fairy tale woman that's

327
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,480
like before we had reference to a large

328
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,550
body of the war literature levels

329
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,680
storytelling can you tell me some why

330
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,890

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,250
this ship they come to an agreement and

333
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,140
hatch a plan to stop a ghost of Harrison

334
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,690
Sadler once and for all was their plan

335
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,140
you asked

336
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,530
okie Ravens to use rocks to trap the

337
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,560
ghost they all arrived at the beachfront

338
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,630
and are just about to complete their

339
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,010
plan No

340
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,700
you'll come with us I can't Jerry

341
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,110
I'm scared Jerry it's just not possible

342
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm frightened well here we all are

343
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,390
you've done well bringing the ghosts ah

344
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,820
yes you thought I was the ghost because

345
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,070
she the ghost convinced you that she

346
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,200
couldn't be the ghost but that I am the

347
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:53,280
ghost clever tricks for a ghost come on

348
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:07,260
Terry wait now what are you screaming

349
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,180
next time you see me sleeping don't wake

350
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,060
me up I'm gonna go ahead and give you

351
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,800
two seconds to figure out the twist have

352
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,020
a guess yep the old people were the

353
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,180
ghosts and they eat dogs maybe they

354
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,560
could have saved us some time and gone

355
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,690
back and eaten Larry Boyd for us and I

356
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,250
can't think anything relevant to say

357
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,660
about the first one that was a long time

358
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,790
ago and I'm saying also I guess all the

359
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,860
other people were ghosts too better they

360
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,600
all just died a horrible death back

361
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,130
there I guess that would mean if they

362
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:44,320
were ghosts before they are now honestly

363
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,090
this show might be some of the cheesiest

364
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,310
shock this side of the planet but I'll

365
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,230
never forget the spirit of the originals

366
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,940
books which are honestly still pretty

367
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,920
gripping today despite the simplicity I

368
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,570
suppose that's what you call good rice

369
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,270
so kick back watch the leaves change and

370
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,550
enjoy the month of October folks it only

371
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,440

374
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080

377
