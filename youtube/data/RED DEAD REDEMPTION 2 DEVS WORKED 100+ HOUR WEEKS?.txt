1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,860
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,750
YouTube boogie2988 comin atcha live was

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,190
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,330
and this is my weekly gaming news

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,340
wrap-up so let's just jump right into

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,260
the games now this week's episode is

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,210
sponsored by the folks over at Nord VPN

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,290
and I know you've heard me talk about

9
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,049
Nord before but let me reassure you now

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,720
it's more important than ever to have a

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,760
VPN installed on your phone if you're

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,380
gonna be using Wi-Fi outside of your

13
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,910
house next week I'm gonna be traveling

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,680
and as usual I'll be connecting my phone

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,380
to the airplanes Wi-Fi the airport's

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,840
Wi-Fi a hotel's Wi-Fi a restaurants

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,880
Wi-Fi I will be connecting to a lot of

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,649
unsecured locations and it seems like

19
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,210
every single day I'm reading another

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,219
article about these hackers who said at

21
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,629
these big conventions who said of these

22
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,670
hotels who set at these restaurants and

23
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,800
use these little pineapple devices to

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,660
steal your login credentials to your

25
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,730
bank account to steal your airline miles

26
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,770
to hack into your private stuff I

27
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,750
definitely do not want that happening to

28
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,820
me that's why I always have noord VPN

29
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,039
turned on on my phone this way I know

30
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,420
I'm safe no matter whether I'm

31
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,340
connecting to my home system or anywhere

32
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,109
else now there's a lot of other perks to

33
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,910
having Nord VPN on my phone or my home

34
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,489
device such as file-sharing or being

35
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,540
able to make it look like I'm from

36
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,650
another country so that I can watch

37
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,570
content on a streaming service from

38
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,950
another country that's that's really

39
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,869
cool not to mention the cybersex option

40
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,700
here for the Android devices allows you

41
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,229
to block ads on the internet which is

42
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,360
really really useful but the best news

43
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,560
is if you sign up for the two-year plan

44
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,110
you only pay four dollars a month and

45
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,369
that is definitely worth it for the

46
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,170
peace of mind along with all the other

47
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,360
perks you have by installing a VPN on

48
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,220
your system so do me a favor and go to

49
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,030
Nord VPN comm /bo OG IE and sign up for

50
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,860
that two-year plan and when you do

51
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,570
you'll be supporting me at the same time

52
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,250
but more importantly you'll be keeping

53
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,110
everything on your phone and all your

54
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,600
login credentials safe I highly

55
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,850
recommend it so the hot topic this week

56
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,640
is the folks over at Red Dead Redemption

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,340
to supposedly working 100 plus hour long

58
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,799
weeks to get the game ready for release

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,899
now that may or may not be true so let's

60
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,790
let's deep dive into it and all of these

61
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,350
rumors about them working hundred hour

62
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,700
weeks starts right here

63
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,560
when Dan Hauser actually said we were

64
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,110
working 100-hour weeks several times in

65
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,719
2018 the finished game including 300,000

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,910
animations 5,000 lines of dialogue and

67
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,709
many more lines to code even for each

68
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,150
Red Dead Redemption

69
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,650
2 trailer and TV commercial we're

70
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:13,950
probably

71
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,720
made 70 versions but the editors may

72
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,340
make several hundred same and I will

73
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,410
both make lots of suggestions as well

74
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,150
other members of the team now the quote

75
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,800
about hundred hour work weeks definitely

76
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,510
got people talking you guys aren't aware

77
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,670
of this a lot of game developers really

78
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,040
do end up going into crunch time a month

79
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,540
or even six weeks or sometimes two or

80
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,459
three months before a game is released

81
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,569
and a lot of people have complained

82
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,780
about having to work 50 60 70 80 hour

83
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,450
weeks so hearing Rockstar admit that

84
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,310
they've done that was was really

85
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,780
shocking and it got a lot of people in

86
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,220
the industry as well as gamers talking

87
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,780
about it here's the story from my past

88
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,790
back when I used to know the developers

89
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,799
that were working at EverQuest they

90
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,150
would tell me during crunch time they

91
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,370
were working 8090 sometimes 100 hour

92
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,670
weeks sometimes never leaving the office

93
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,810
living in their office sleeping in their

94
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,180
office if they slept at all just before

95
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,769
an expansion launched as an expansion

96
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,239
launch to make sure that everything was

97
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,950
working correctly to make sure that the

98
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,780
servers were up so I've definitely heard

99
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,970
those kinds of stories before so this is

100
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,489
very believable now dan Houser did try

101
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,560
to clear that statement up by letting

102
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,239
everybody know that that wasn't the case

103
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,370
for everybody working in at Rockstar he

104
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,440
was only talking about himself and three

105
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,750
other writers on the lead team who spent

106
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,850
about three weeks towards the end of the

107
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,370
game development for the story working

108
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,380
really really hard to make sure that was

109
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,450
going live so not not everybody at

110
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,280
Rockstar is supposedly putting in like

111
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,930
slave-like hours and they certainly

112
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,280
weren't doing it for years or even

113
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,810
months he said they were only doing it

114
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,910
for about three weeks full statement

115
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,109
here on the screen if you want to pause

116
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,420
and read it but largely Houser says that

117
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,819
he Mike guns were through for Humphreys

118
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,680
Lazlo and himself had as they always

119
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,900
have three weeks of intense work where

120
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,609
they wrapped everything up only three

121
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,459
weeks not years he said we've all worked

122
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,900
together for at least 12 years now and

123
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,790
Phil we need this to get everything

124
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,560
finished after so many years of getting

125
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,819
things organized and ready on this

126
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,680
project we needed this to check and

127
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
finalize everything as you can imagine

128
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,069
the YouTube and Twitter rumor mills

129
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,019
really started milking this so rockstar

130
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,090
actually encouraged its employees to

131
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,260
speak out about their personal

132
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,790
experiences working there and we've seen

133
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,720
a few people do that

134
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,940
vivianne Langdon who works at Rockstar

135
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,380
says I've never worked more than maybe

136
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,910
50 hours a week and that's a rare

137
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,650
occurrence but I generally work about 2

138
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,660
to 6 hours of paid overtime for a week

139
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,280
Danny banister says I've been with

140
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960
rockstar for two years and worked on Red

141
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,610
Dead Redemption too I've never worked

142
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,930
anywhere close to a hundred hours

143
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,639
week there was some crunch sure but

144
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,229
nothing ridiculous we worked hard on the

145
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,120
game but we weren't being abused I think

146
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,500
the most I did on Red Dead Redemption

147
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,410
too was 60 hours for one week and then

148
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,729
he followed up by saying I know for a

149
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,139
fact that my lead would have sent me

150
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,580
home if I ever attempted 100 hours a

151
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,560
week that's just not how it's done here

152
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
however Tom Fawlty who works at Rockstar

153
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,880
North says I should probably add my

154
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,320
voice to the conversation going on

155
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,539
around crunch we do crunch

156
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,220
I've not seen anybody forced to work 100

157
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,780
hour weeks but I've definitely seen

158
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,699
friends get closer to that figure than

159
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,889
is healthy he added I am asked

160
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,479
encouraged and expected to work overtime

161
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
both nights and weekends when coming up

162
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,900
to a big deadline the most I've ever

163
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,639
worked in a single week during my nearly

164
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,639
5 years here has been 79 hours but that

165
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,599
was not recently

166
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,699
personally I know for a fact that crunch

167
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,560
is a thing in the video game industry

168
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,479
and just about any other industry just

169
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,039
before a launch just before release it's

170
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,840
absolutely going to happen a hundred

171
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,270
hours sounds extremely exaggerated

172
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,070
though I doubt that even Dan Hauser and

173
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,770
his team put in 100 hour weeks it just

174
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,599
wouldn't be productive to do so now that

175
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,610
said do I think the folks at Rockstar

176
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,370
are probably overworked absolutely they

177
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,650
might even be underpaid but it does look

178
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,479
like the majority of them when asked to

179
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,210
do overtime get paid for overtime and

180
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,949
that's a good thing I would imagine

181
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,110
there are still some salaried people who

182
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,580
are working far more than they're

183
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,320
getting paid for that would sink and

184
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,699
that happens all throughout the industry

185
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,560
but it sounds like Rockstar certainly

186
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,630
isn't any more problematic than the rest

187
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,979
of the industry in fact it sounds like

188
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,030
they're doing pretty good

189
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,470
but it does look like they're definitely

190
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,060
overworked at Rockstar if you were

191
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,530
putting in 60 hour weeks that's

192
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,270
exhausting 70 hour weeks

193
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,759
somebody claiming 79 hours for the work

194
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,590
that's just not productive I can't

195
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,849
imagine you're being compensated for

196
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,680
that and even if you are that's just

197
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,479
exhausting you probably should never

198
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,340
have to work that hard even during

199
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,470
crunch time it sounds like poor

200
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,449
management if that's the case but at

201
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,889
least it does sound like it's a rarity

202
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,449
if this is happening over at Rockstar

203
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,340
and not the way to expect people to work

204
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,020
and that's a good thing I'm curious as

205
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,310
to what you think though have you ever

206
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,409
put in an 80 or a hundred hour work week

207
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,789
is that something you could even imagine

208
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,370
doing it doesn't this make you scare to

209
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,690
be a game developer does this make you

210
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,699
want to be a game developer if you are a

211
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,050
game developer I would love to hear your

212
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,250
stories let me know in the comments

213
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,659
section below and let me know if you're

214
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,560
still gonna pick up bread Dead

215
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,719
Redemption - I know I'm definitely going

216
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,639
to if people work that hard on the game

217
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,800
makes me wanna play it all the more

218
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,090
there is good news about Red Dead

219
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,249
Redemption - and I saved it for last it

220
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,870
looks like according to news reports

221
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,449
there's about 60 hours worth of gameplay

222
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,639
in the campaign on average probably more

223
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,800
if you do everything in it that's a

224
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,150
really really good thing that sounds

225
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,560
like an average work week at Rockstar

226
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,389
though I wonder how many of you guys are

227
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,159
gonna beat that game in a week and not

228
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,349
even get paid for it but 60 hours is a

229
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,729
lot of gameplay so I'm looking forward

230
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,150
to it

231
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,469
oh and one more thing about Red Dead

232
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,669
Redemption - as you guys know I

233
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,889
generally do not recommend pre-ordering

234
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,569
because of bugs and other issues and

235
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:13,529
stuff along that line said always

236
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,389
waiting til the review but if you do

237
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,830
decide to preorder a Red Dead Redemption

238
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,719
- you can start pre loading that game

239
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,849
now which is good because it looks like

240
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,379
the Xbox version of the game is taking

241
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,810
up eighty eight gigs worth of space and

242
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,669
the PlayStation version is listed at

243
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,879
being over a hundred and ten gigs of

244
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,650
space and in fact they said the retail

245
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,990
version of it might actually be on two

246
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,729
different discs so if you plan to get

247
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,379
that game digitally you probably want to

248
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,020
start pre loading it right about

249
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,580
yesterday now in a previous episode of

250
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,710
this show I promised you guys that there

251
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,129
would be Diablo 4 news at Blizzcon the

252
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,750
folks over Blizzard aside to make a liar

253
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,060
out of me apparently according to this

254
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,979
news post by Blizzard it looks like

255
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,870
Diablo 4 will not get announced at the

256
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,270
show which is only a few days away they

257
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,069
say we know what many of you are hoping

258
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,180
for them we can only say that good

259
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,039
things come to those who wait but evil

260
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,469
things often take longer we appreciate

261
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:05,789
your patience as our team works

262
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,710
tirelessly to create nightmarish

263
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,969
experiences where they the lord of

264
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,529
Terror while we won't be ready to

265
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,149
announce all of our projects we do

266
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,490
intend to share some diablo related news

267
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,339
with you at the show so who knows maybe

268
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,500
we'll get something but we're probably

269
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,020
not getting a release date they did say

270
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,610
the November 2nd is not only the first

271
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,319
day of Blizzcon but we would get some

272
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,050
diabolical news that day what it'll be

273
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,000
we honestly don't know I'm gonna think

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,620
maybe a mobile game at this point

275
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,599
it's also the day that the Nintendo

276
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,550
switch version gets released which I do

277
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,779
plan to pick up because I want to play

278
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,640
Diablo on the go even though I've never

279
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,839
played with a controller I never played

280
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,339
a console version should be a good

281
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,289
version I hope especially with Ganon as

282
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,930
a playable character but I mean I guess

283
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,940
maybe we'll at least get to see a logo

284
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,250
for Diablo 4 but if that games coming

285
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,589
out I'm thinking 2021 at best at this

286
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,000
point
