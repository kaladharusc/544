ignoring me the thrusting of my pelvis

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,230
that suggests that maybe you should get

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,640
out of my way why are you in my house

satisfying but somehow it's the exact

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,770
opposite of that

78
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,600
