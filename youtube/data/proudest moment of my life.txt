freeway and then on the other side there's a drainage ditch where it's

I

25
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,610
apparently we're not going to late but this drive is taking us an extra hour

26
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,550
and a half

27
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,000
traveling with babies not easy

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,300

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,280

30
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,019
he's around photo albums 1996

31
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,319
I was 15 and my little brother

32
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,720
this is my dad me and my kid brother that's us like a few blocks from here

33
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,140
so this is what i look like going into freshman year in high school

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,910
that's me there I don't have any pictures of me from when i was in high

35
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,450
school

36
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,530
that's like the thing about high school is when you're in high school that is

37
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,300
your entire world and as you grow up you realize that the significance of high

38
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,890
school doesn't really go away

39
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,310
this this is 1999 and this is what I look like

40
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,470
that's 17 or 18 year old Casey the year I was supposed to graduate high school

41
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,560
and that is one year old oh and my kiddo and he was one

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,760
see I never graduated high school I dropped out when my girlfriend got

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,630
pregnant which was which was junior year

44
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,790
there is again I didn't drop out of high school because I didn't think high

45
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,960
school is cool

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,440
I didn't drop out of high school because I had something better to do i dropped

47
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,510
out of high school because I had to

48
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,960
I didn't have any money i had to get a job to support my new baby

49
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,240
I worked in a restaurant washing dishes now there are a lot of things I don't

50
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,850
remember from that time my life but there's one thing that I remember

51
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,280
distinctly and that senior skipped it

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,640
that's the day of your senior year in high school your last year in high

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,480
school when everybody skip school and parties and even though I wasn't in high

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,950
school I still went super excited to see all my friends again but when I was

55
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,330
there I felt like an interloper

56
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,090
I felt like I didn't belong and that was one of the hardest i did that me up man

57
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,650
I remember that and I I felt like a loser

58
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,340
see I wanted to finish high school and never been proud of the fact that i

59
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,310
dropped out of high school I did it because I had to I did it out of

60
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,250
necessity but you remember when my kid was born

61
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,140
that was 18 years and two months ago today when my kid was born promising

62
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,650
myself that he would never have to deal with that I was dealing with done that

63
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,660
he would never have to drop out of high school

64
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,350
as you would graduate alongside his friends and going to bigger things

65
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,150
