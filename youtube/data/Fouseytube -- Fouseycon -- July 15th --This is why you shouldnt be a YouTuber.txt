1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,380
Tyler Perry put me in his movie! Ayyyy

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,120
(Female Reporter)
This wasn't the venue youtuber Yousef Erakat,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,360
known as fousey, had in mind.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,940
He organized and promoted through social media

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,220
what he called the &quot;Hate Dies, Love Arrives&quot; concert at the Greek Theater.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,000
But when someone called in a bomb threat,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,040
1500 concert-goers had to evacuate.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,980
(Felix)??*claps*

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,540
What the hell is wrong with YouTube?

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,160
You know, not just YouTube but the YouTubers specifically.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,380
We barely just forgot about the TanaCon.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,260
But apparently, one of the most appalling YouTubers

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,780
FouseyTube

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,040
saw TanaCon and thought to himself,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,260
(still Felix/ Pewds)
Yeah! I can do that.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,260
But worse.
(laughs a little)

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,260
That's right ? every?body

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,080
FouseyTube, the guy that fakes drama with Ricegum.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,240
errr.. Oh, Ricegum punched me

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,600
(clip plays with minecraft ambient peaceful music)

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,960
High Pitched Hyucks

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,280
this is a medical disorder

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,960
he's the kind of youtuber whose ego is so big

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,480
that literally he cannot take

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,040
any form of criticism

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,980
and I'm sure  he's gonna watch this video

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,200
goin : &quot;omg ,Pewdiepie talked about me guys&quot;

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,800
&quot;wow&quot;

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,320
&quot;I'm such a big deal&quot;

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,820
no

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,500
no you're not

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,720
i want it to be clear

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,640
i'm making this video

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,620
specifically to ridicule you

35
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,600
*chuckles*

36
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
it's not  a compliment

37
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,020
i'm not complimenting you

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,620
but apparently

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,480
hashtag

40
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
#thekingisback

41
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
everybody

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,660
and needless to say

43
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,360
the event was a disaster

44
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,020
first of all

45
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,300
*beautifully chuckles*

46
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,400
*beautifully laughs*

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,360
a lot of people showed up

48
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,640
to this concert

49
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,380
&quot;concert&quot;

50
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,900
with quotation marks

51
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,380
apparently fousey got the idea

52
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,720
that in five days

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,220
he's going to  arrange

54
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,320
the most lit concert

55
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,180
in L.A.

56
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,040
the &quot;Free Coachella&quot;

57
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,900
as he calls it

58
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,700
fousey: tell them where tickets were gonna be

59
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,580
on it's own

60
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,780
it's 3:18 right now

61
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,940
tickets are gone

62
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,920
they've been gone

63
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,600
people are reselling tickets

64
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,240
already

65
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,540
you guys heard this before?!

66
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,560
you guys heard this?

67
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,780
tana: free tickets just gone

68
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,700
fouse: they've been gone

69
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,960
tana: thousands and thousands

70
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
fouse:tickets are gone

71
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,360
poods: tickets just gOnE (mimics tana and fousey)*chuckles*

72
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
thousands and thousands

73
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,560
they.. they just get off on this stuff

74
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,740
so many people came to MY event

75
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,660
i'm important right

76
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,120
*makes weird sound

77
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,200
i'm still relevant right guys?

78
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,300
fouse: people are reselling tickets

79
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,060
already

80
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,640
poods: as you mayayayay

81
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
have already imagined

82
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
this event follows lot of similarities

83
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,860
to TanaCon

84
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,620
promises of a -- people appearing

85
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,400
that didn't really happen

86
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,320
*chuckles a little*

87
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,300
and by really i mean not at all

88
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,140
he.. fousey had been hyping that

89
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,840
Drake was gonna be there

90
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,020
he never technically said it but

91
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,520
it was insinuated

92
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,420
and the fans bought it as well

93
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,200
putting Drake in the thumbnail

94
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,480
saying Drake will show up

95
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,940
if this video gets a million views

96
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,260
two million views

97
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,080
keemstar

98
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
the litlle.. the sly little gnome

99
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,380
obviously knew something was up

100
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,260
keemstar: like we don't really know what this is right?

101
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,880
so is that why everybody clicked on July 15th?

102
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
*people agreeing*

103
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
someone: i feel like thats the reason

104
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,020
keemstar: who do you think is gonna be here

105
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,220
someone : YOU

106
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,200
*laughing*

107
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,840
keemstar: i am definetely here

108
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,080
some guy: maybe snoopdog

109
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,860
keemstar: you think spoopdog?

110
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,500
that'd be f-ing dope

111
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,400
guy  with the camera:if the lava something works jake paul would be here

112
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,660
*repeats*

113
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,820
keemstar: do you guys think that Drake is gonna be here

114
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,760
guy with the camera: hell yeah.. hell yeah

115
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,380
Someone: a very good chance!

116
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,300
poods: yeah very good chance

117
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,080
very veveve very good chance

118
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
there is a very good chance

119
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,420
Drake was in New York during this event by the way

120
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,660
*laughs*

121
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,380
he was most definitely not gonna come

122
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,420
and if he did it would be what?

123
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,480
ten  hours late?

124
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,640
it's gonna be like the royal rumble

125
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,440
of a concert

126
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,760
coz you don't know who's coming out

127
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
that's the fun part

128
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,260
poods: Jay cool is coming

129
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,040
ooh..

130
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,300
the fun part is that i..

131
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,720
i can't tell you who's coming to this event

132
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,860
but you know

133
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,720
i'm gonna name drop all this big rappers

134
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
if they show up or not

135
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,260
pff .. you know i never tecnically said anything

136
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,140
you know what they got

137
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,200
you know what they got instead

138
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,900
way better than Tekashi 6ix9ine

139
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,040
way better than Jay cool

140
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,420
way better than

141
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,160
uh

142
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
Drake

143
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,280
they got my man

144
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,640
lil poppy

145
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,700
that's right they are still breeding &quot;lil&quot; rappers

146
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,540
i feel like any new rapper at this stage

147
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,280
shows up with a name &quot;lil&quot; in front of it

148
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
that i haven't heard about

149
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,300
i immediately want that person just to disappear

150
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,820
GONNA GET LIT

151
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,400
here we go

152
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,660
(what is this)

153
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,080
(wtf)

154
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,740
(send help)

155
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,220
poods: he basically sings his line for  six minutes

156
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,560
i'm not joking

157
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
i'm not gonna bother showing it to you

158
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,040
but that's essentially it

159
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,180
and he tries to teach his audience to sing this line

160
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,640
no one remembers the line

161
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,120
and no one really cares

162
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,040
(showes clip)

163
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,240
look at that audience

164
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
if that audience isn't lit

165
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
i don't know what a lit audience looks like

166
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:03,280
(shows clip)

167
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,520
so.. it didn't really work to get the audience lit so

168
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,740
lil poppy

169
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,120
genious as he is

170
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,820
decides

171
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,700
you know what

172
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,040
maybe if I give away a  free t-shirt to the audience

173
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,020
then it will be lit

174
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,700
(no it won't)

175
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,760
now i don't wanna disrespect this artist

176
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,020
honestly a lot of them weren't bad but

177
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,420
no one knows who they are

178
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,900
at least the people that came to the event

179
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,660
didn't come to see Lil poppy

180
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,140
didn't come to see

181
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,240
Lil manbun

182
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,340
didn't come to see

183
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,460
keemstar

184
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,640
*laughs*

185
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,980
oh wow look how sold out that is

186
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,400
thousands and thousands of tickets just gone

187
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,500
(keemstar says the thing )

188
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,840
poods: *claping* hehehe he

189
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
he said the thing

190
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,420
guys he said it

191
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,980
great

192
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,300
they clearly just got payed to show up

193
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,760
hey you guys uh um uh listen to this guy

194
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360

195
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,320

196
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,920
&quot;yo what's popping LA?&quot;

197
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,380
&quot;Thank you guys so much for coming out and showing support to all the creators and fouseytube&quot;

198
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,120
&quot;We couldn't do it without you guys. Love arrives, hate dies&quot;

199
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,700
&quot;You already know what it is&quot;

200
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,140
i'm a hand over the mic to alex wassabe give it up for him everybody

201
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,600
poods: you guys know what it is right?

202
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,060
uh um

203
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,920
and alex just goes

204
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,140
alex: yoo wassup

205
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,980
wow

206
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,580
did fousey put this together in seven days?

207
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,320
look at this

208
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,640
This is crazy. This is gonna be crazy, I don't know exactly what's about to go down

209
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,020
but im excited

210
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,540
poods: no one knows whats going down

211
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,840
i like how it said &quot; need 2 million viewers for drake&quot;

212
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,860
it got one point nine

213
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,020
million views

214
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,760
and then it got taken down for copyright

215
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,660
so the video would literally

216
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,920
never ever

217
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,900
get two million views*laughs*

218
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,800
some random guy: i was here i was scared

219
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,080
we had no reception

220
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,720
pure chaos

221
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,580
Reporter: Police Say the caller claimed there was a device at the theater

222
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,080
the bomb squad and the canine unit were called in to search the grounds

223
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,580
 

224
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,620
Officer Sanchez: No actual device was located. However due to the Direct Threat

225
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,320
 

226
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,620
It was determined that the venue should be evacuated.

227
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,200
That decision was made by the general staff here

228
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,280
And in conjunction with all our officers and supervisors

229
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,000
Reporter: Some big name artist would be taking the stage

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,200
Girl: I'm actually from Chicago. I flew out here and um--expected to meet Drake

231
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,680
And it completely went over the barn so it was kind of disappointing

232
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,320
Guy: Drake was suppose to be here. LeBron James was supposed to be here

233
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,560
Uh, J. Cole was supposed to be here

234
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Pewds: Clearly these people were very happy with how this event turned out

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,240
*beautifully chuckles

236
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,340
Why you keep having events

237
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,320
Stop.Having.Youtuber.Events

238
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,360
Stop. Just stop

239
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,080
Why did he come up with this idea

240
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,880
TanaCon did an event in 30 days and it was a complete disaster

241
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,220
*mocking* I'M gonna do an event in 7 days

242
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,100
I can prove that I can make a bigger disaster

243
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
You think you're worse than me Tana?

244
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,960
Nah, I'm worse

245
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,940
Fouseytube then appeared in the parking lot and

246
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,860
uh, started acting like he was a messiah

247
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,200
Fousey: Can I say something? (Crowd: Yeah!)

248
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,860
Fousey points: To YOU

249
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm looking at you dead in the m*f*king eye

250
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,020
I'm not hiding behind twitter I love you

251
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,560
I f*cking love you

252
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,960
(Random guy: We love you too fousey!)

253
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,580
Pewds: cut to 10 minutes later

254
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,760
Fousey: before I even got to tell my story

255
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,000
You're making a documentary on it

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
So you can post it after the fact

257
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,700
So this attracts, you coulda put this onto the hot news

258
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,320
and how fousey f*cked up and he should kill himself

259
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,820
(crowd boos)

260
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
But if this is a success

261
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,980
I become a good person, but why do you get to profit off of me being a good person

262
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,840
Why can't I make a documentary on this story

263
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,040
(pewds chuckles)

264
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,820
(crowd continues booing)

265
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,840
Pewds: what is he doing

266
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,800
You're still talking about the little things

267
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
Pewds: but before we get into that

268
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,540
I feel like we need a lil bit-- a lil bit more context

269
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,200
Why is he acting like this?

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
What is wrong with him

271
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
I don't care enough to find out, but I guess if you tell me

272
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,960
I'll listen

273
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,260
You're welcome everybody I'm about to break it down

274
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,700
Fouseytube was on tour in Australia and realized

275
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,040
&quot;Wow I really used to have a lot more fans coming to my meet-up events&quot;

276
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,560
&quot;What is going on it's AlMoSt like I'm not as relevant as I used to be&quot;

277
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
&quot;and people don't care about me as much&quot;

278
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,020
&quot;So maybe I should just cancel this event and create a NEW one&quot;

279
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,340
&quot;Maybe I can just make it free so that more people will show up&quot;

280
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,340
&quot;and then just lie about all these artists that are gonna appear&quot;

281
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,220
Fousey: we did a 375 venue show in Australia

282
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,640
and I sat there and I was like

283
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,100
something's not right

284
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,140
cuz in 2012 before I even HIT it on Youtube, I get a sold out show for 3000 people. In Australia

285
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,040
Pewds mocking: WoW I used to have 3000 people watching me

286
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,420
Now I just have 300 MeEH

287
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,380
He somehow got it into his head that he's Kanye West

288
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,880
Fousey: ya'll, sit tight. Um

289
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,760
People hate like on Yeezy and stuff because of how much he bigs himself up, right?

290
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,460
But, what's wrong with that?

291
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,480
What if we all did that as people and stop recognizing it as being egotistical

292
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,460
or being into yourself and saying

293
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,120
I understand how powerful I am as a person

294
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,480
Pewds: cuz that would be obnoxious just like you are *chuckles*

295
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,240
He also appropriated Drake's whole look for some reason

296
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,140
giving money

297
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,820
giving TwEnTy Australian dollars

298
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,460
away, to his fans, guys

299
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,500
pretty big deal

300
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,580
Fousey: alright look, how much is Australian dollars

301
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,540
like 200? Take this

302
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,840
give this to the people. Give it around, pass it around

303
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
(some KooL KiD being super KooL)

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,340
(pewds claps, BullyHunter music in the background) Fouseytube, a man of the people

305
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,140
&quot;ay how much is 200 in Australian dollars&quot;

306
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,440
what a legend, make sure you get this on camera right

307
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,160
(robot voice) hey guys, I know Drake's dad. Laugh out loud.

308
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,280
Thousands of tickets just gone. Free tickets just gone

309
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,560
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha

310
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,200
Pewds: he's insane. He's absolutely insane

311
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,640
He's making a video saying that I can't believe I'm here

312
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,620
(mocking) guys, did you know I know Drake's dad *shrug*

313
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,620
y'know, it's no big deal. It's whatever

314
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm friends. I'm friends with Drake's dad. We hang out. We play Fortnite together *beautiful chuckle*

315
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,380
He also went to TMZ's office just like Kanye did when he was promoting his album

316
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,420
so, well KaNyE dId It, So I gUeSs I could do it too

317
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,360
Fousey: I'm tryna invite ya'll on July 15, let's talk. Literally

318
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,280
TMZ. Right now. With the crew

319
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,860
(guy: what are we doing right now?) Fousey: uh, just go take a nap

320
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,120
Pewds: LiTeRalLy I'm on TMZ right now. It's lit. It's lit guys.

321
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,460
(fousey laughs like a lil maniac)

322
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,340
Pewds: they're gonna love it.

323
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,560
Obviously they weren't let in. No --they don't care

324
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,940
What's with wearing hats like this.

325
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,140
(Gloria Borger voice) Now I'm not the most fashionable person

326
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,600
But can someone explain this trend to me

327
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,180
Ok? What is this?

328
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,620
But the best part out of all this

329
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,260
*weird chuckles*

330
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,600
is the fousey breakdown on the parking lot after the event got cancelled

331
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,480
Fousey: can I say one thing?

332
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm crying right now because I'm in fear

333
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,080
*laugh*

334
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,640
(mocking) &quot;can I say one thing?&quot;

335
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,040
&quot;I am so-- I am crying right now, as you can tell. I'm devastated

336
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,580
Fousey: I love *** banks

337
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,740
I LOVE banks

338
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,420
Pewds: I love banks too

339
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,620
They enable loans

340
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,440
make people start their own businesses

341
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,520
grace the economy. I LOVE banks

342
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,380
He's talking about banks the youtuber

343
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,440
Apparently he's thrilled about banks because he answered him on DMs one time

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,920
Foursey: that year that I gave up, I would DM Banks at random, and he's at the top, running shit in LA

345
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,040
and he would still DM me back

346
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,940
Pewds: WhAt? wHat? Someone DMed you back

347
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,980
Dude. You're on top of the world. You're basically god now

348
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,780
This guy. This guy

349
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,120
Fousey: cuz if we all worked together we could make billions of dollars

350
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,080
I don't even know if I'm supposed to be sharing this information

351
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,640
Pewds: nah he better not, pls don't share this information

352
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:36,360
Fousey: They calling me crazy bc it's higher level thinking cause you're thinking clearly. Without greed. Without ego.

353
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,580
Pewds: this guy is actually saying that he's thinking without greed, and without ego

354
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,260
And anyone that thinks otherwise and thinks he's crazy

355
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,700
They're not on his higher level of thinking

356
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,760
That's what it is. You're not --if you don't understand

357
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,860
That this man basically has NO ego, it's cuz you're not on the higher level of thinking

358
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,780
That's on you, basically

359
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,020
Fousey: why can't I start an infrastructure, call it Fouseytube enterprises

360
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,180
set up teams, set up groups, set out infrastructures

361
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,420
so I can help make the world a better place

362
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,000
Pewds: just DO it. Just do it. No one cares. No one's stopping you

363
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Why can't I be KaNyE WeSt MEeEh

364
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,540
So he goes off and tells how he met Drake

365
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,260
And I don't understand how anyone is listening to this man at this point

366
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,640
that's the most amazing thing out of all of this

367
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,920
I mean I guess it's like watching a train wreck

368
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,960
It's the same reason I'm talking about it

369
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,920
It's fun to look at

370
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,400
But then finally, why did he do all this?

371
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,500
What was the point?

372
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,220
Wh-why- What did he try to achieve

373
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,540
Well apparently he released a song

374
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,460
This is all to hype up his song

375
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,640
I imagine at the very end Fousey was gonna come out and play this song

376
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,680
But instead we get to hear it on the parking lot

377
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,500
And it's- it's a killer. It's a killer

378
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,740
Now what he says is that this song is gonna be the NUMBER ONE billboard hot hundred

379
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,460
350 million views in under three months

380
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,660
A Club BANGER

381
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,840
On radio in the entire world at least once a day

382
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,260
uhhh, let's, uh- let's hear it

383
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,460
Fousey: This song is gonna be talked about by celebrities. Reacted to by every single youtuber in the world

384
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,000
Pewds: *laughs* every single youtuber in the world

385
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,500
ohhh

386
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,260
Maybe, maybe that's what's happening right now. Maybe I don't even know

387
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,820
Fousey:Yo Khalid,  acting's not working out for me can I get on your album maybe?

388
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,460
Khalid: Absolutely not. Don't play yourself (smart decision tbh)

389
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,040
Pewds:Wow it's feat. DJ. Khalid, that's really cool

390
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,700
Fousey: hey Brian.

391
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,900
*creepy chuckle*

392
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,560
Rice ain't got no spirit

393
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,700
Got no deeper layer

394
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,640
One ghostwriter, one ghost for my player

395
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,960
Pewds: It's a, a ricegum disstrack

396
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
The number one banger

397
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,680
Played all across the entire world. Reacted by every single youtuber

398
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,880
350 million views

399
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,220
It's a ricegum disstrack

400
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,520
It's a ricegum disstrack!

401
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
It's a- of course!

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,060
Of course, that's what people play at the club.

403
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,140
Pewds impersonating someone at the club: I love this song! I love how he hates on ricegum!

404
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,020
*starts chuckling*

405
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,060
*clap clap* alright I'm done

406
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,900
Alright, I'm done. I'm done

407
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,180
That was it. That was- July 15  the Fouseytube event disaster summarized for you

408
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,220
*Pewds imitating philip defranco*: In case you didn't know, you've just been filled in

409
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,800
Fousey if you're watching, I'm sure you are, hello, how are you doing?

410
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,220
You literally just appear needy, egotistic, and like a complete moron

411
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,120
We're really seeing this more and more now with youtubers

412
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,360
that once were big, grasping to anything for the relavency

413
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,020
Doing anything to desperately  attempt to stay relavent

414
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,900
and it's, ya know, as sad as it is it's still very entertaining

415
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,160
I'm not complaining

416
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,980
*chuckles* but I keep thinking so many youtubers should not have been youtubers

417
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,140
Fousey's clearly not 100% in his head

418
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,200
And it's tough being a youtuber and  I think a lot of people just aren't ready for it

419
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,960
Once you hit that high of getting subscribers, getting money, uhhh, everyone loves you, ya know?

420
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,960
But it comes to a point for everyone  where you just start- it starts going down and some people just can't accept that

421
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,880
and I think it drives people crazy

422
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Fousey I would encourage yourself to ask yourself &quot;Why do you want all these things?&quot;

423
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,100
&quot;Why do you want this song to be the hot hundred?&quot;

424
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,660
&quot;why do you want it to get this many views?&quot;

425
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,380
&quot;Why did you make it? What was the point of it?&quot;

426
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,420
Cause I think, until you're honest with yourself and answer those questions, your just gonna keep falling in the same trap over and over and over

427
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,320
And I genuinely- I- like i enjoy laughing at this stuff

428
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,720
But I also don't really genuinely feel like I hope he just goes crazy and ends up dead or something

429
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,180
I don't know, cause that's what I'm seeing here. A path to it

430
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,520
that being said this video's over now!

431
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,740
Go ahead and leave a like if you enjoyed watching. I really appreciate it.

432
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,320
Subscribe if you haven't. Hit that bell button

433
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,240

434
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,000
Goodbye.
