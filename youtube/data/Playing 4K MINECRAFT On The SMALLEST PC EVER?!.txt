mini desktop it's just it's pretty neat

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,750
not much to it they also provided a

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,280
remote to control the mini PC I find

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,410
this pretty awesome they I've reviewed

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,200
one of their more professional remotes

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,960
and it was very fun to use nonetheless

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,520
it was very fun you got pulled a little

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,690
tab and this one is just a basic remote

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,660
for it but it has looks like it has your

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,760
basic necessities that you could even

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,220
use with it if you connect it to a TV

57
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,160
which is you could as well so it's sleek

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,790
small light and thin which is pretty

59
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,190
darn awesome and now we have the actual

60
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,460
PC the one the only the very sleek

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,870
design it's beautiful

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,750

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,010

64
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,100
I love how small it is I love everything

65
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,050
about these computers they are so handy

66
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,210
and they are so fun to have and we had a

67
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,200
little warning sticker that you can

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,910

71
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,310
vents on the side we have the the

72
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,100
heating design on the top and on the

73
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,010
back let's focus in the camera come on

74
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,980
focus focus focus we have on the back we

75
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,510
have the internet port we have a lot of

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,680
different ports - we have two USBs we

77
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,980
have the HDMI the VGA the power cord

78
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,510
the type-c USB and a place for

79
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,700
headphones and on the side we have two

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,640
more USBs and an SD card capable up to

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,990
200 and I believe it's a 200 was a 256

82
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,850
gigabyte some something like that - and

83
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,420
you have 256 gigabytes SD card to add on

84
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,130
to the storage that already has in it

85
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,040
which is very useful okay guys I set up

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,660
everything here

87
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,390
on my desk I have the mini PC hooked up

88
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,610
to a mouse a keyboard and I'm gonna get

89
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,920
the HDMI cord to plug into the monitor

90
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,420
but we have the mouse to the keyboard

91
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,850
and power cord so we need to plug it

92
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,980
into the monitor and it's gonna be

93
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,960
pretty nice pretty sleek does not take

94
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,010
much room at all and we still have to

95
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,410
technically three available USB s so I

96
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,500
could I could plug in a microphone USB

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,420
microphone professional microphone and a

98
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,600
webcam and it'd be right right all there

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,330
it would be a good nice little recording

100
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,450
setup and here we go we're setting up

101
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,730
setting up setting up it's going good

102
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,560
it's going good

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,910
it's gonna take a few minutes to set up

104
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,840
guys but we will get there soon all

105
