1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,319
hello everybody my name is markiplier

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,170
and welcome back to universe sandbox now

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,390
I haven't played this game since the oh

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,650
it's so cool song came out I've only

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,090
played it once and I think that's

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,710
actually a tragedy because I I recently

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,269
came across some videos of this again I

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,029
was like oh man I really think this game

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,340
is cool like this game is just kind of

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,840
alright whoa hey whoa ease up there

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,080
Sonny Boy wow there's so much detail on

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,830
that look at that I didn't know the hell

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,750
was there before though the squiggles in

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,940
the Sun so it's been a while since I

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,430
played it again and uh yeah I thought

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,530
I'd just give it another go and I wanted

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,450
to do this a bit more objective-based oh

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:50,059
my god as far as it goes oh boy

19
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:53,100
whoa ah man this thing still blows my

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,590
mind I mean it's it's it's just like

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,600
it's not that crazy but it's kind of

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,730
crazy okay so there's a few things that

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,649
I wanted to do when I played this again

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,090
the last time I played this I didn't

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,619
really have an objective this time I

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,799
want to recreate a few events and also

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,750
create some events that are from

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,880
questions that I would have and I would

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,010
kind of like to see reproduce in a way

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,409
that is less destructive to our solar

31
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,930
system and leads to us all being dead oh

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,240
man look at all these objects you know

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,009
for the first time in a long time

34
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,500
I went out to Hawaii for my vacation I

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,659
could see the center of the Milky Way

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,220
like I could actually see it it's

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,350
something if the night is clear enough

38
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,670
and you don't have as much light

39
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,960
pollution and some people around the

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,460
world like this is a common thing but if

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,530
you look up at the sky you can actually

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,159
see the center of the galaxy this is

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,680
such a fascinating concept and and I

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,750
haven't seen it since I was a kid just

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,549
because it's been so like light

46
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,290
pollution in LA and stuff like that but

47
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,210
you can lose sight of this beautiful

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,810
like magnificent or inspiring sight

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,119
that's just available for everybody to

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,219
see up in the night sky the sheer

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,950
magnitude of that center of the galaxy

52
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,530
it not even comparing to the rest of the

53
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,479
universe like the sheer magnitude of

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,190
that center of the galaxy just that

55
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,020
milky arm spreading across the sky is

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,840
so immensely huge that you cannot

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,030
perceive it like the magnitude of it is

58
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,470
something that your brain tries to

59
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,080
process but it just does not go anywhere

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,220
near the truth of how tiny we are in

61
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,530
comparison to that object and it's not

62
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,060
even an object it's a collection of

63
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,910
objects and then beyond that it's just

64
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,120
one galaxy in a universe of billions of

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,420
galaxies but I could see that and it

66
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,730
kind of got me thinking like a I want to

67
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,310
play the skin so here I am ready to play

68
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,350
it again and so what I want to do like

69
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,510
in the beginning here what I really

70
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,640
really want to do is I want to reverse

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,459
time okay we're gonna go back in time

72
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,760
we're gonna go back in time really far

73
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,340
okay so what I'm doing right now is I'm

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,600
sending the solar system into a spiral

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,660
of death what we have here is a

76
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,360
simulation that's running faster than it

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,420
can mathematically collate so what's

78
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,160
gonna happen eventually is this is going

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,060
to get so unbelievably wonky as it

80
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,130
starts to lose its position that things

81
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,959
are going to drift farther and farther

82
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,180
of where they actually would be in an

83
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,070
accurate simulation and we're just going

84
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,810
to eventually fall apart you can see

85
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,820
like this this actual target is much

86
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,310
lower than what it should be I'm aiming

87
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,850
I'm aiming for yeah a hundred and

88
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,680
forty-five thousand years per second but

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,299
I think that's that's a little bit too

90
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,269
much let's let's get like I want it I

91
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,340
want to hit a nice nine hundred years

92
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,170
per second that's what I that's what I

93
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,670
would be going for I mean this is

94
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,150
blazing through it's now 1885 but I want

95
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,160
to go farther I want to go all the way

96
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,930
back to the beginning and the only way

97
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,430
to do that is to sacrifice some accuracy

98
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,660
otherwise I'm gonna be here forever so

99
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm going to increase the max positional

100
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,450
error to let's make it a good old 10 m/s

101
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,329
that's how bad the positional can be so

102
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:14,890
let's keep it going

103
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,269
oh now what's interesting is this

104
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,519
movement here that's actually the

105
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,850
movement of the Sun through the galaxy

106
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,070
see the sun's not just in one spot it's

107
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,370
moving we all are I mean not just around

108
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,470
the Sun but our entire solar system is

109
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,710
moving around the galaxy in a big spiral

110
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,770
as the Milky Way twists and turns so do

111
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,530
we twist and turn upon it among the

112
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,120
billions and billions of stars that we

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,700
exist on but this is still not going

114
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,810
fast enough or faster oh and lots of

115
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,590
faster all right there we go now we're

116
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,960
picking up some speed oh my god that is

117
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,410
not right oh we're getting into some

118
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,270
kind of a spiral but we're moving faster

119
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,030
now a little bit faster but uh you know

120
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,610
it's uh is what it is so let's add

121
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,280
another zero to this bad boy no not

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,630
there on that side of the decimal

123
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,470
doesn't work anything okay whoa whoa oh

124
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,810
we are booking it back in time all right

125
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,450
we are gunning we're gunning back in

126
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,200
time way wickedly way way way fast so

127
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,340
I'm gonna pause this point and where are

128
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,410
we exactly what what oh what is uh what

129
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,850
is the current situation that's going on

130
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,820
here we've got a whole lot of nothing

131
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,890
let's let's tune it down let's go back

132
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,590
to one year a second let's try to make

133
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,160
this a little less crazy you know I

134
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,530
don't even know where earth is here

135
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,140
where's earth did we lose our there's

136
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,850
earth okay I think we might have lost

137
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,729
her oh my god we lost our earth oh no

138
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,660
earth wait um earth baby listen listen

139
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,060
uh whoa earth there you are okay

140
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,310
Earth okay you're being real optimistic

141
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,190
saying that it is zero zero zero zero

142
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,590
eighty and there's life on this planet

143
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,810
with lights and whatnot but you know

144
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,760
let's let's let's assume that you're

145
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,560
just being optimistic here okay so we've

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,060
officially destroyed the entirety of

147
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,620
everything we have reversed time into

148
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,810
the point where everything exploded yeah

149
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,180
it's no good so one of the things that I

150
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,090
wanted to explore was this topic that

151
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,620
there could be a moment where earth just

152
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,400
simply loses it like if the Sun were to

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,830
disappear okay if for whatever reasons

154
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,400
say a black hole or another star passed

155
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,130
close enough by our solar system to pull

156
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,740
the earth out of orbit or if the Sun

157
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,160
were to suddenly disappear completely

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,770
all of the planets would just like go

159
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,710
off instantaneously tangential to where

160
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,360
they were originally going with nothing

161
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,070
left to pull them down into the gravity

162
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,080
well the Sun nothing's gonna hold them

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,310
in orbit anymore therefore they

164
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,530
instantaneously just carry on the way

165
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,880
that we're going so what I want to do

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,180
now is I want to show you let's how do

167
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,830
we reset this whole shebang

168
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,120
all right so here we have the solar

169
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,930
system it is home the only home we'd

170
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,460
ever know and the only home that we got

171
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,289
right now what's gonna happen if I just

172
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,160
you know get rid of the Sun if say for

173
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,060
example the Sun just pause disappear

174
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,310
what would happen there they go all the

175
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,440
planets all the orbiting objects

176
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,490
everything that once was is now gone off

177
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,740
on its own Jupiter's going off on its

178
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,720
own all of the asteroids are going off

179
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,240
their own Uranus is off on its own as we

180
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,720
all know Neptune even Pluto gone off

181
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,900
into the cold dark depths of forever now

182
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,970
that we're at this point it's a little

183
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,430
too late but what if we were to suddenly

184
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,210
bring the Sun back let's say the sun's

185
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,200
gonna go right try to get it exactly

186
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,289
where it was point and there she is oh

187
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,280
whoops there she goes

188
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,849
oopsies ah wait oh no that's two suns

189
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,830
now that's not what I wanted okay that

190
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,940
is just regard damn dick ulis can you

191
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,680
okay now we got two suns in an orbit all

192
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,300
right not what I was hoping for but hey

193
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,190
you know I'm not complaining that is a

194
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,919
pretty sweet ballet okay so we got two

195
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,930
ballet ting Suns here going off in a

196
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,419
spiral and you can see that the other

197
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,510
objects in the solar system are suddenly

198
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,769
starting to be pulled back

199
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,389
not all of them Eartha seems to be

200
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,300
pretty well off on its own it might have

201
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,550
a slight curve towards ya it's got a

202
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,050
slight curve but I don't think it's ever

203
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,910
gonna return back but you never know

204
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,319
let's see what happens

205
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:57,040
Jupiter has made quite the turn yeah

206
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,129
Jupiter seems to be coming back the Sun

207
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,230
is desperately trying to orbit the other

208
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,619
Sun he be is caught up in the dance real

209
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,879
hardcore earth is still projected to

210
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,160
dance out that way for almost all

211
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,170
eternity but oh my god you can see its

212
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,939
projected line just with the dancing of

213
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,860
the sun's it doesn't know what it's

214
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,709
gonna be doing that's funny don't add

215
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,809
more Suns to this okay let's add another

216
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,939
Sun there oh whoa okay wait no it's not

217
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:31,389
good I just blew up everything holy shit

218
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:39,489
oh shit okay well supernova aside Wow oh

219
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:43,089
oh oh God

220
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,040
okay that that was a bigger boom than I

221
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,439
thought it was gonna be okay all right

222
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:49,329
okay all right okay that's that's not

223
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,339
good all right okay let's reset for a

224
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,600
second all right now I know what I'm

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,329
gonna be doing I have a good idea so

226
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,339
what I'm gonna be doing the most

227
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:58,959
fascinating thing that I see yeah

228
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,879
besides blowing up the entirety of the

229
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,399
Sun that's fun and all but I want to go

230
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,529
through as many ways as possible of

231
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:08,980
destroying the earth our home the only

232
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,379
home that we have and what worse fate

233
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,319
could befall it than to be subjected to

234
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,089
the forces of the cruel cruel universe

235
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,699
of which we live in it's not gonna be

236
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,699
fun it's not gonna be pretty but it's

237
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:24,429
going to be what we do here so I want to

238
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,839
focus on just old-fashioned Earth

239
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,369
removing all the other variables I mean

240
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:32,290
in this one we're gonna obviously like

241
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,299
we're not gonna be doing much but it's

242
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,790
just earth earth and it's lonely moon

243
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,739
let's imagine a few scenarios all right

244
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,299
everyone put your thinking caps on

245
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,660
so imagine Earth is here right it's fine

246
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,189
but I think one of the nightmare

247
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,410
scenarios is that the moon would

248
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,129
eventually just fall into earth one way

249
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,540
I can do that is actually just by making

250
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,500
earth way heavier it's

251
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,960
this looks Oh shirt Oh goodbye what the

252
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,330
hell happened

253
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,780
fragment did you scrape the earth Oh bit

254
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,700
too fast hang on away I didn't even see

255
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,810
it what the hell happened

256
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,090
all right go again oh is that oh well

257
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:20,580
incoming I guess Oh dad dad looks like

258
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,040
one of my Kerbal space program

259
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,190
trajectories gone horribly wrong you Shh

260
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,550
okay yep this one is not gonna go

261
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,260
farther it's gonna be in a decaying

262
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,180
orbit until it eventually just slams

263
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,170
into this thing

264
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,890
oh the fragments oh my god the gravity

265
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,050
of Earth is ripping the moon apart

266
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,390
that's so cool

267
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,090
the moon is literally being torn to

268
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,890
shreds which is probably bad because

269
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,180
these fragments are probably gonna be

270
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,380
slamming into Earth in no time flat but

271
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,110
besides that let's focus on the other

272
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,120
here in the now oh my god there's so

273
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,250
many fragments either way this is not

274
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,810
spelling good stuff for the earth the

275
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,180
earth is in a lot of trouble and oh here

276
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,650
comes oh my god the moon has an evil

277
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,610
glowing eye staring death right out

278
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,790
there though my god they're fragments

279
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,660
get pulled right off of the moon there's

280
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,730
a reason oh look at the shadow oh that's

281
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,880
cool yeah so that's what happens with

282
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,070
like Saturn's rings there's a certain

283
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,410
zone inside Saturn's gravity well where

284
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,380
objects orbiting it cannot stay in one

285
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,960
piece they cannot collate into an object

286
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,520
because their gravity is not strong

287
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,580
enough to fight against the forces of

288
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,980
like the orbital like trajectory of

289
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,050
being that close to something like

290
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,390
Saturn it gets torn to shreds like

291
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,610
what's happening to the moon right now

292
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,380
so even these fragments I think are

293
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,330
getting torn into even smaller fragments

294
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,430
so every time they get hit they get

295
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,160
ripped apart again which is creating I

296
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
believe a ring or at least it will

297
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,000
create a ring here comes the moon again

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,760
oh it's beautiful oh yeah more fragments

299
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,800
all right so let's just let this run for

300
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,420
a good while I'm gonna go up to 10 hours

301
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,030
a second it's just gonna run unless the

302
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,580
moon slams into the earth which I don't

303
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,530
think actually it's gonna do I think

304
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,360
it's gonna be a super elliptical orbit

305
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,100
and every time it passes by more and

306
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,770
more fragments are gonna be torn up each

307
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,270
of the fragments getting smaller and

308
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,440
spar it's like being run through a

309
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,540
blender and some of the fragments aren't

310
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,950
coming back like obviously those guys

311
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,110
ain't coming back but the ones that do

312
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,820
get caught in here they just keep

313
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,890
spiraling over and over again

314
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,210
that's so cool this is not what I

315
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,850
expected to happen oh they're coming

316
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,620
back the fragments are coming back oh

317
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,020
look at you guys oh look at you guys or

318
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,030
any of these guys coming back nope those

319
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,540
guys are out II the moon has lost a lot

320
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,730
of its mass the moon has lost almost

321
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,040
three powers of ten of its mass just

322
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,630
from being shredded in the Earth's

323
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,550
gravity I'm not a hundred percent sure

324
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,750
but I think the moon actually might be

325
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,100
getting closer and closer to this thing

326
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,890
whoa that one tore up into a bunch I

327
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,120
wonder if there's something I can do to

328
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,610
make the Earth's atmosphere larger oh

329
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,140
that's so cool

330
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,060
you can make green could we could we try

331
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,390
to simulate the terraforming of a planet

332
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,550
like could we terraform Mars Oh that'd

333
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,650
be nuts

334
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,120
okay that's next on my list that's next

335
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,240
on my list oh that's so cool okay so but

336
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,830
anyway let's try to make more atmosphere

337
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,360
let's say the atmosphere is going to be

338
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,960
larger it is now one magnitude larger

339
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,290
which I think should cause some of these

340
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,410
things to rub and therefore slow down

341
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,390
okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna put the

342
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,480
kibosh on this I'm gonna raise the let's

343
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,820
go back to one I'm gonna raise the mass

344
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,550
to no not one hundred and twenty twenty

345
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,880
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay yeah Wow

346
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,290
oh wow that is that is causing a great

347
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,910
deal of destruction I I'm sorry oh boy

348
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,640
yeah wha Oh oh boy that's that's bad

349
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,070
okay well

350
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,320
I have a funcle' who have a funkalicious

351
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,280
feeling that the moon's gonna have some

352
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,430
to say about this real soon and by real

353
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:32,880
soon

354
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,390
I mean right about now slow slow slow

355
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,550
slow slow down there we go alright Moony

356
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,350
sorry it had to be like this but you

357
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,720
know how it'd be you know how it'd be

358
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,350
bub oh and before we hit let's make you

359
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,100
Massey er just just cuz you know you

360
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,840
gotta be what you once was you can't be

361
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,820
what you are you're you're just a

362
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,830
shrimpy boy now you got to be a big

363
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,320
beefy boy you know what I mean I think

364
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,090
the moon was bigger than that I'm pretty

365
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,750
sure alright Moony there you go not ask

366
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,050
more like a moon maybe even the moon was

367
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,170
a burger I think oh yeah no it's it's

368
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,250
that's about the size of the moon

369
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:35,700
alright now you may impact your we done

370
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,060
yeah we done yeah we all done yeah we

371
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:47,580
done oh my oh wow you know what this is

372
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,270
gonna do this is gonna form another moon

373
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,650
that's what this is gonna coalesce into

374
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,850
I bet that's gonna form another moon oh

375
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:06,510
no way it's gonna come never ride it's

376
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,010
just gonna cause a horrible ring of

377
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,870
destruction is that is that what's left

378
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,470
of the moon

379
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,650
wait what is what is that that is a very

380
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,180
there's a very round formation what the

381
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,650
heck oh my god oh my god it did

382
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,740
it formed another moon this one is 21

383
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,809
times the mass of the moon but this is

384
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,480
not the original moon they hit this is a

385
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,570
fragments that coalesced into this super

386
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,890
super hot ball of liquid rock and while

387
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,830
the earth is just burning alive oh my

388
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,530
god it is it is just a fire wave of

389
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,350
destruction it is still going oh my god

390
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,260
these are probably tidal waves of lava

391
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,580
kilometres high huh of the earth it's

392
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,090
like a perfectly oh my god that is

393
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,679
beautiful and horrible yeah and there's

394
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,020
more still crashing into it right now

395
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,049
but this guy is good I thought I thought

396
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,380
that was gonna be food no isshe's Oh

397
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,150
actually I mean what if I drop the

398
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,450
weight of the earth just just a bit

399
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,799
let's make it 15 let's make it 15 yeah

400
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,750
let's actually let's make it let's make

401
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,020
it down to 10 let's make it 10 see how

402
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,630
that does see now the orbits a little

403
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,250
bit bigger the earth is still getting

404
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,860
bombarded and that's okay but this is

405
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,679
now not going to impact again so let's

406
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,110
crank up the time while this is you know

407
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,480
this is currently dying but you know it

408
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,490
is what is about the earth you know it's

409
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,020
saying its swan song it's it's pretty

410
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,450
much done so so why not why not go a

411
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,549
little faster all right so all as if

412
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,679
this point all life has been wiped off

413
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,210
don't think that just cuz this sections

414
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,289
not on fire doesn't mean that

415
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,490
everything's dead there because

416
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,220
everything is very dead they're

417
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,100
extremely dead very dead all oceans

418
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,620
boiled off everything is just gone the

419
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,260
mantle is ruptured so the entire like

420
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,760
the entire surfaces is going to be

421
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,250
completely destabilized and all the

422
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,870
tectonic plates look right now the the

423
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,419
water is boiling off which is such a

424
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:18,590
cool feature I didn't know that they

425
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,789
could actually do that but the water is

426
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,950
boiling off and the water is now all

427
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,830
vapor all greenery is gone there's

428
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,110
nothing left but ash and dust and

429
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,990
there's another piece no that's the same

430
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,350
piece okay now this is the new moon this

431
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,870
is old Earth

432
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,540
it's New Moon and there you have it

433
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,590
these fragments are still gonna be

434
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,760
falling back down

435
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,030
we are very dead but what we got fair

436
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,970
trade is a new moon let's go up to one

437
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,640
hour a second okay oh that is just that

438
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,620
is just beautiful

439
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,780
this is just beautiful I don't think we

440
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,980
just got a moon I think we got our I

441
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,130
think we got a like a belt whoa look at

442
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,640
this guy

443
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,400
oh he's beefy oh that's a beefy piece oh

444
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,390
that is a big piece yep oh the earth is

445
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,640
just going to be unbelievably hot molten

446
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,190
lava surface for like four years I mean

447
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,690
we will figure out how many years Oh

448
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,940
fragments coming in yeah but this is our

449
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,480
new moon can i rename it name new moon

450
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,280
there we go

451
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,440
it's so cool that's so cool that's so

452
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,720
cool I mean with everyone's dad bears

453
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,550
all qahal well the fragments are

454
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,840
starting to cool down so they're gonna

455
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,580
lose some of their glow some things are

456
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,620
still impacting but yeah it's gonna be

457
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,030
like this for a long time so let's go

458
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,400
ahead let's go up to ten let's go up to

459
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,080
as fast as it'll go let's get some speed

460
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,790
out of this right the earth is starting

461
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,390
to cool on one side anyway it's still

462
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,600
really hot like really really really hot

463
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,450
but as it cools OH

464
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,679
some pieces of the new moon are being

465
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,980
pulled into the earth which is not gonna

466
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,020
do well for it I wonder if it'll ever

467
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,380
like get out of the lopsided orbit let's

468
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,690
reduce the mass of the earth back down

469
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,910
to a little bit more reasonable levels

470
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,740
and let's make the moon you know

471
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,050
let's make it almost equally a

472
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,770
difference okay so new moon where is New

473
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:21,990
Moon going

474
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,520
so New Moon's orbits still little

475
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,050
lopsided but it's the least it's going

476
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,000
around the earth the Earth Day is still

477
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,210
extremely hot way too hot to have any

478
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,030
water yet but weirdly enough I think

479
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,050
this is snow in some weird ecological

480
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,520
parts of this there is snow

481
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,630
I don't know where the lights coming

482
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,900
from but yeah still there that's cool

483
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,910
how's the new moon doing Newman's going

484
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,920
down oh it looks more like just a rock

485
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,660
well that's that's not fair

486
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,580
that's not fair I thought it'd be looks

487
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,350
more spherical oh come on now I'll

488
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,240
smooth out over a few millennia

489
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,520
it's only been 158 days according to the

490
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,890
simulation shit that's not long at all

491
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,380
all right what is the auto orbit do well

492
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,860
there we go

493
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,320
ooh orbit well that's nice now its orbit

494
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,750
then nice oh cool okay all right that

495
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,910
situation is done well that's that's one

496
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,160
way to kill the earth I always do like

497
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,280
like different examples of that okay but

498
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,810
what I'm gonna do now is something a

499
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,270
little bit different instead of having

500
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,730
the moon pull itself into the earth I'm

501
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,500
gonna pull the earth into the moon we're

502
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,810
gonna make this bad boy we're gonna make

503
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,210
this bad boy literally a hundred moons

504
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,450
big let's make it even bigger let's make

505
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,130
it even bigger it's only one of earth

506
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,320
let's make it let's make it a hundred

507
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,700
earths who's a big boy who's a big boy

508
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,760
who's who's a big boy let's make it even

509
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
bigger let's make this bad boy a

510
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,190
thousand earths whoa who's a big boy

511
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,490
Odessa Odessa moon all right okay so

512
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,150
hoof all right so this is what I like to

513
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,000
call the super moon you know you may

514
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,600
have heard of a super moon in terms of

515
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,060
you know

516
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,270
in terms of like it's pretty big tonight

517
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,600
now if this one it's uh it's um yeah

518
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,180
it's uh it's gonna kill us all so let's

519
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,250
see that in

520
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,980
motion so what's gonna happen the earth

521
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,020
is pretty much making a straight beeline

522
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,670
guys it is not even close it's not even

523
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,800
close to an elliptical that is straight

524
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,930
into the moon okay so this is a

525
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,520
nightmare scenario imagine there was

526
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,860
some crazy scientists that found a way

527
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,840
to increase both the size and the mass

528
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,710
of the moon

529
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,030
cuz you know they don't have to

530
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,040
necessarily be the same thing but little

531
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,950
ol earth everyone you know and love oh

532
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:11,360
[Laughter]

533
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,040
geez that was uh impactful oh oh now

534
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,230
it's your turn moon and now you get

535
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,490
burned to a crisp but you know it's okay

536
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,870
the moon is now to the moon is now three

537
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,400
times the size of Jupiter and and she's

538
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,070
a burnin oh she's a burning bright

539
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,170
alright let's speed her up okay there we

540
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,230
go BLAP all right cool well that is um

541
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,370
not good it's a firestorm but that's

542
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,280
okay alright but while we're at this oh

543
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,920
maybe we could maybe we could terraform

544
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,470
this bad boy

545
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,430
she's real hot 7700 degrees that's real

546
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,040
hot but I don't think we're gonna be

547
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,230
able to terraform this oh wow that's hot

548
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,450
wait why are you getting hotter what

549
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,660
wait what's happening

550
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,620
the moon's shrinking the moon the moon

551
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,880
is collapsing in on itself oh oh oh it's

552
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,430
gonna start fusion eventually oh my god

553
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,170
what's gonna happen when it hits that

554
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,550
point what's gonna happen I mean right

555
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,620
now it's not it's not really a star it's

556
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,500
it's just it's a very very very like

557
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,350
dense planet that doesn't mean that it's

558
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,120
not going to the densities falling off

559
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,920
but that doesn't mean that it's it's

560
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,280
still going up that's crazy

561
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,020
okay let's speed it up just a little bit

562
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,620
well she is bright I love this I love

563
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,230
this so much I don't know if she's gonna

564
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,710
make a diffusion density I don't know

565
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,190
what the dense

566
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,230
okay density is now falling off pretty

567
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,170
good okay is that because I increase the

568
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,670
gravity did the gravity actually

569
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,400
increase is that just me being crazy

570
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,470
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna add

571
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,810
things to this until it gets you know

572
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,430
the right thing how big is Jupiter

573
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,350
Beckett Jupiter is technically bigger

574
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,470
than this but this is three times the

575
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,050
mass of Jupiter I mean that I think

576
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,420
that's what makes it like fascinating

577
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,200
okay let's add let's add some clothes

578
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,290
Herbet or earths okay would never mind

579
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:43,030
then too close too close oh boy oh well

580
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,030
that's that's fun

581
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,680
okay we got some earths ah now what I

582
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,470
intended to do humanity died a long time

583
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,420
ago but I think I think this is just

584
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,400
overkill at this point alright I'm gonna

585
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,590
jump the mass of this to four to swallow

586
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,900
these up swallow oh yeah okay so the

587
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,930
mass is actually the density is actually

588
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,330
decreasing which is fascinating that's

589
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,550
weird the density is decreasing probably

590
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:20,910
as it cools ah a weird it's gonna settle

591
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,250
into some kind of bizarre like it's

592
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,650
gonna actually cool down the surface

593
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,510
gravity is immense but it's cooling down

594
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,460
so I went off on a weird tangent I I was

595
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,750
I know I'm trying to destroy the earth

596
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,820
here but just I went on a fun a tangent

597
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,920
because I couldn't help it this is so

598
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,890
cool okay so she's cooling down pretty

599
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,520
good but that's not what I want she's

600
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,010
burnt she's a little toasty a little

601
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,620
toasted a little little burnt on the

602
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,110
edges let's make this five let's go five

603
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,020
whoo not what did I just do it turned

604
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,310
into it how did you do 500 I said five

605
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,130
okay the density just the density went

606
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,090
nuts I don't know what happened okay I

607
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,000
wanted to go five but it went to 500 for

608
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,790
some reason okay so she's not she's not

609
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,490
done she ain't done yet

610
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,030
but she's doing pretty good but I'm not

611
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,860
done yet

612
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:30,900
tools material ah hydrogen cool I don't

613
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,190
know what this is doing for the moon but

614
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:40,350
you know shooting hydrogen at it oh she

615
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,240
just turned into a gas giant

616
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,380
what the hell well that's so weird

617
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,410
oh never mind yo she back there she is

618
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,720
the moon is now a beautiful blue gas

619
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,050
giant with clot you can see oh that's so

620
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,100
nice and I love that so much that's so

621
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,860
nice let's get some water in there

622
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,580
okay that might have been enough ooh it

623
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,409
is getting toasty okay the density is

624
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:13,370
definitely going up who's getting hot oh

625
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,220
it's always getting hot oh it's getting

626
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:26,460
hot and it's getting toasty oh oh she's

627
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,690
heating up good

628
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,960
I love the band's just the like bands

629
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,210
are those simulated those simulated

630
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,100
bands based on like the density of it

631
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,139
like and what it actually because it's

632
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:40,500
these really harsh spirals of heat so

633
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:52,889
cool oh it just it just wore ho she just

634
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:59,820
went solar oh she just went solar and

635
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:06,740
then suddenly the moon is now a star oh

636
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,840
and you can ride along the surface of it

637
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:22,080
oh my god that's real cool okay anyway

638
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,090
alright enough of that I just got

639
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,139
distracted I'm trying to blow up throw

640
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:31,820
to blow up earth climate simulation ooh

641
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,260
wait climate simulation what would that

642
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:47,279
do what no way what I don't know what

643
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,049
could do that what the hell that's so

644
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:52,860
cool

645
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,059
so let's imagine just for a bit I'm

646
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,149
going to add this is another way that we

647
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,190
can destroy the world we're gonna add

648
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,370
just two gosh-darn much let's not make

649
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,510
it earths let's just do let's do uh

650
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,520
kilograms no not that much let's do a

651
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,340
thousand kilograms there we go

652
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,810
it's going we're going to

653
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,670
lovely let's go one day a second you

654
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,090
know let's add us some carbon dioxide

655
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,710
okay this is gonna do next to nothing to

656
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,860
the earth so let's try to at least make

657
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:34,950
it some kind of considerable oh the

658
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,040
earth is okay well that all right there

659
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,950
you go the earth just got fucks its God

660
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,330
yeah okay and the earth destroyed

661
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,600
checkbox' done there I think the UH the

662
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,740
what threw me off there was just like

663
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,180
yeah what threw me off was everything

664
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,490
another big fear is that for some reason

665
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,500
somehow someway we create a black hole

666
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,530
on earth now not just any black hole

667
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,660
because these are big black holes what I

668
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,410
want is I want a black hole that is tiny

669
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,220
a tiny itty bitty black hole so let's

670
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,920
pause this and imagine just imagine that

671
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,250
in the centre of the earth was a black

672
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,720
hole now the black hole is there I might

673
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,670
actually reduce the mass of this black

674
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,450
hole to 0.01 the mass of the Sun which

675
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,920
is still considerable it's about ten

676
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,510
Jupiter's actually let's even make that

677
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,700
smaller let's make that point one

678
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,980
Jupiter's it's a small black hole but a

679
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,470
black hole it still is even smaller than

680
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:44,160
that let's go ten Earth's tiny black

681
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,110
hole by comparison but we make it

682
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,910
somehow in the center of our earth is a

683
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,420
black hole

684
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,150
so let's reduce this down to the seconds

685
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm gonna go one second at a time and

686
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,550
see what nevermind it's gone okay jeez I

687
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,800
don't think that's go but alright whoa

688
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,020
that's cool alright wait back up a

689
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,170
second back up a second oh god I don't

690
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,730
think that's what would happen but you

691
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,860
know yeah that's just odd alright so

692
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,140
let's try this again we're gonna go one

693
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,180
minute per second we're gonna add a

694
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:20,730
black hole right here black hole Sun

695
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,380
won't you come wash away the pain it's

696
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,470
gonna be the size of Earth

697
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,290
what happens as you can see not very

698
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,190
much oh wait we got something what is

699
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,310
this what was that I don't know what

700
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,040
that is what is that what are these what

701
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,840
are all these dots what is happening oh

702
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,820
oh oh the the water is getting pulled

703
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,120
off of the earth is that what is that

704
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:59,560
what that is oh oh oh oh she's oh she's

705
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,180
she's a goner

706
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,600
oh oh she's a she's a goner all the

707
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,620
water just got ripped off of the earth

708
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,420
every drop of it probably the atmosphere

709
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,690
to surface temp is now 2,000 degrees

710
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,480
just from that pass pieces of the earth

711
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,890
huge pieces this is it this is an

712
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:24,820
enormous enormous about point at 2% the

713
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,700
size of the moon pieces of the earth 2%

714
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,230
the size of the Moon are being ripped

715
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,960
straight out of africa by a black hole

716
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,530
the size of one earth and then this is

717
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,380
going to go into the earth right about

718
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:38,770
there

719
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,410
I speed it up a bit and she's oh it's

720
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,290
impacting back down yep this black hole

721
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,270
did did quite a number on yield earth

722
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:55,330
here hoo hoo hoo Nelly oh well there she

723
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,570
goes there she goes there she goes the

724
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,580
second pass turns out to be much much

725
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,460
much more destructive oh ma oh mama

726
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,190
Jambo the earth don't look so good there

727
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,060
the earth yeah at earth um yeah that's

728
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,440
uh Wow Oh

729
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:20,680
oh my oh holy shit holy shit okay so

730
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,310
where do the whys don't make black holes

731
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,890
throw them's bad news them's just bad

732
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,790
news all around

733
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,360
oh my computer is struggling lesson

734
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,750
learned

735
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,270
don't uh don't do that oh that's a

736
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,790
pretty sight though oh look at this the

737
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,950
echoing shock waves just on the earth

738
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,820
that's crash

739
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,270
in there that's dunzo oh my god

740
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,380
that's so cool alright so that's one way

741
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,540
now what else I'm gonna do let's load

742
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,630
back up ye olde earth again this poor

743
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,980
earth I'm subjecting it to so much

744
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,660
horrors alright so what am I do is I'm

745
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,460
gonna turn this moon into a black hole

746
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,410
in procedural steps we're gonna go I'm

747
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,360
not gonna mess with its mass at all I'm

748
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,230
gonna mess with its density it's uh

749
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,940
let's say it's calculated radius that's

750
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,530
gonna be on I'm gonna make its density

751
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,190
now 100 grams per centum centimeter

752
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,260
squared so it's now much more dense

753
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,620
right he's a dense ball he's the dense

754
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,290
ball but it's still not so bad alright

755
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,150
let's go a thousand bonk

756
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,480
she's tinier is much smaller she's much

757
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,430
smaller but not to buy it okay let's go

758
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,650
ten thousand all right dying here she's

759
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,750
getting teensy tiny now now see the

760
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,580
orbit will not be changed in any way cuz

761
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,220
it's still the same mass same exact mass

762
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,630
so the orbits not gonna go any

763
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,270
differently but if we keep cranking her

764
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,190
down not the earth no thank you

765
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,020
keep cranking her down let's go another

766
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,580
one point again Blanc and tints it died

767
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,330
near very very tiny super tiny very

768
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,520
dense very dense okay let's go one more

769
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,370
then very dense very very dense okay

770
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:08,200
let's go even tinier dance oh she's so

771
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,910
dance moon is now tiny tiny the moon is

772
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,430
56 centimeters across its surface

773
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,430
gravity is one point five six times 10

774
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,150
to the 13th meter per second which

775
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,920
technically should be faster than the

776
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,230
speed of light very very faster so this

777
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,760
should have turned into a black hole but

778
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,980
it hasn't for some reason so let's go

779
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,380
even further okay where's the moon

780
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,600
there's the moon okay there we go

781
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,000
the moon is now disappeared it is 0.026

782
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,140
let's crank it back down a bit

783
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,180
so this simulation was correct it this

784
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,220
should be a black hole it is basically

785
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,230
the equivalent of a black hole it is

786
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,020
super dense it should not exist that way

787
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,460
and yeah it's uh that's pretty crazy

788
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,710
okay this is now five point six

789
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,020
millimeters this is the size of a bullet

790
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,340
but same exact orbit same exact orbit

791
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,570
because nothing's changed about the mass

792
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,820
of it now what would happen if I did

793
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,450
change the mass of it right so it's

794
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,460
radius I'm gonna lock it I'm gonna lock

795
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,370
the radius lock that radius off done

796
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:23,380
that chains a mess there we go it is now

797
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,780
become the black hole because I changed

798
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,760
the mass of it and I wasn't supposed to

799
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,330
do that but it's now a black hole just

800
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,990
sucked in all all the matter down to a

801
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,240
singularity light can't even escape it

802
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,730
but it's a black hole now so does that

803
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,570
mean it changed anything about the orbit

804
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,360
from the earth

805
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,070
apparently yes which isn't necessarily

806
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,840
supposed to be true that's not

807
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,100
necessarily supposed to be how that

808
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,970
happens not I represent sure why cuz

809
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,340
even if it was a black hole it shouldn't

810
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,860
be any different you know what I mean oh

811
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,600
but I did increase the mass of it that

812
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,880
that's what happened okay so what I'm

813
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,710
doing now is I've created a new galaxy

814
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,350
basically there we are okay so I just

815
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,200
spawned a new galaxy on top of Earth

816
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,720
pretty much on top of it's not right

817
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,370
there but this one's got some dark

818
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,880
matter so that's not gonna go well

819
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,680
basically dark matter who honestly knows

820
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,780
what it is no one knows what it is no

821
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,610
one knows what it does but there's also

822
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,950
a supermassive black hole in the center

823
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,550
right here so that is gonna do a number

824
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,090
on earthy boy right here so let's just

825
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,120
see where she's going oh she's going

826
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,350
dead into the okay well that's not good

827
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,550
well let's see what happens huh

828
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,210
as hilarious as it is to have this moon

829
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,980
like that I'm gonna just

830
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,350
okay I'm gonna think of a stop it for a

831
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,510
moment just cuz very hard to keep this

832
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,690
uh this this idea going okay just gonna

833
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,130
get rid of the moon for now sorry moon

834
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,510
you Audi oh and we off we off like a

835
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,490
rocket apparently we're gone three

836
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,160
thousand years a second we were going

837
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,400
three thousand years a second yes plug

838
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,920
that takes a real long time still to get

839
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,170
to the supermassive black hole but we're

840
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:23,390
going at three alright so just imagine

841
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,880
everyone is able to live long enough to

842
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,250
panic for over a hundred thousand years

843
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,940
now as we journey to the center of this

844
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,100
supermassive black hole there we've made

845
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,200
it almost no distance alright we need to

846
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,560
jump it up a little bit we're gonna go

847
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,290
we're gonna go we're gonna go a hundred

848
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,520
thousand years a second and we are just

849
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,210
barely making progress at a hundred

850
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,120
thousand years per second we are just

851
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,040
starting to make some progress let's

852
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,230
make that five hundred thousand years

853
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,700
per second okay we're very close to our

854
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,860
destination apparently or near some dark

855
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,050
matter I don't know where the black hole

856
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,110
is but uh you know I have a funny

857
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,440
feeling it's real close okay I think I

858
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,050
missed it where the hell did the we're

859
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,840
the supermassive black hole go you know

860
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,510
the supermassive black hole that I was

861
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,680
looking at it we passed it we somehow oh

862
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:34,160
we're off cigar cigar Oh cigar is the

863
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,710
name of the galaxy okay alright that's

864
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,500
funny alright so we made it guys good

865
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:39,740
job

866
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,940
everybody be happy oh shit never mind we

867
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,950
are a nice ball we are a ball of ice

868
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,500
where there is no life not even it but

869
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,210
we are some persistent sons of bitches

870
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,550
are we yeah we're tenacious

871
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,440
alright baby way that's that's that

872
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,540
apparently the next way that we're all

873
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,930
gonna die is by making the Sun go

874
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,040
supernova

875
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,270
now technically

876
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,010
I think the Sun is supposed to go

877
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,870
supernova but I don't think that's

878
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,170
supposed to be going anytime soon but

879
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,620
you know let's just say that this bad

880
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,470
boy he's gonna go kaboom me real hard

881
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,310
gravity weight was gravity not on what

882
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,160
was gravity not on what since when was

883
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,790
gravity not on where is gravity not on

884
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,210
Oh

885
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,250
Uriel explode we're gonna make this bad

886
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,410
boy explode we're gonna explode you get

887
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,840
ready for explody it let's slow it down

888
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,920
to by the hour and let's explode uh yeah

889
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,730
let's explode you bang ok supernova it

890
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,250
has begun we're going by the let's go by

891
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,500
the minute actually 1 minute per second

892
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:57,080
I go and we're kabooming and work

893
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,210
kabooming and we can see the view from

894
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,010
Earth as a spectacular explosion ooh

895
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,800
it's real pretty as it comes to destroy

896
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,310
all of your money and as the blast gets

897
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,380
closer and closer we're already heating

898
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,290
up more and more so you know that's

899
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,080
something to look forward to

900
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,510
ok if we watch very closely it looks

901
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,540
like a big old eyeball but instead of an

902
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,140
eyeball it's red hot death exploding

903
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,900
towards us very quickly the oceans have

904
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,420
started to boil away which is always a

905
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,410
good sign

906
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,050
the supernova has almost engulfed us it

907
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,470
is very very scary okay we are just

908
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,710
crossing the threshold of the supernova

909
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,250
we are now 300 we're now 400 degrees

910
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,990
Celsius surface temperature there's

911
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,400
still some ocean left which is very

912
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,320
shocking to be perfectly honest surface

913
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,030
temperatures approaching 700 degrees

914
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,730
hell yeah it's like an oven in here even

915
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,110
hotter than it was before in Africa but

916
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,030
now it's really a lot we didn't even

917
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,320
know there was a chain like that that's

918
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,060
cool well let's step it up a bit we're

919
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,230
gonna go 10 minutes earth is 2,000

920
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,860
degrees I feel like in 3000 oh God okay

921
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,470
it's roasting alright we are starting to

922
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,300
become incinerated by the expanding

923
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,950
supernova these supernovae it has like

924
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,500
now officially we're I think we could

925
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,099
definitely be

926
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:21,559
we are 9,000 degrees we are 10,000

927
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,710
degrees we are all continents have lost

928
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,880
all shape or form they are very oh the

929
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,989
earth is contracting oddly enough is

930
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:34,819
she's getting smaller I guess by the

931
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,319
temperature is like causing it to be

932
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,319
more dense oh she's oh no I think she's

933
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:41,539
no she's just bleeding off all of its

934
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:43,609
mass is literally exploding off of it oh

935
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:45,529
that's what's happening okay the earth

936
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:46,970
is shrinking because it is losing

937
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,859
everything that it once was and it is

938
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:52,500
now going going going going going going

939
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:59,000
and she's gone

940
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,140
she gone baby

941
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,359
how's Mars doing how's Mars bars doing

942
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,750
oh not any better she's roasting I just

943
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,869
got over here to say Mars uh go off into

944
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:13,290
the sunset and goodbye Mars and the

945
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,480
supernova has claimed us all we are all

946
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,550
dead and we will never ever live again

947
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,650
because we're dead

948
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,810
fun times what is happening here I don't

949
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,300
feel like this is a good thing whatever

950
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,890
is happening here and I'm not sure what

951
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,690
happened here but whatever's happening

952
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,430
here oh yeah that's that's not good yeah

953
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,150
that's okay we reach in line to go into

954
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,430
Jupiter even Oh Oh God

955
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,880
oh no I came at a bad time

956
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,300
chubowski asha boosts Keyshia Bull okay

957
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,640
that's one way for earth to die I don't

958
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,869
know who put us like this but that's

959
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:55,070
definitely a way for earth to die and

960
00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:00,359
the winner is Jupiter all right there

961
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:01,320
you have it not what I was hoping for

962
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,150
but and that happened all right so now

963
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,710
that we've killed the earth over and

964
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,240
over again let's do something else let's

965
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,220
do something a little more fun I want to

966
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,640
try to terraform Mars okay so here's how

967
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,310
we're gonna do this Mars is an ice

968
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,160
planet it's not quite as big as Earth it

969
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,690
doesn't have anywhere near the

970
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,640
atmosphere and as far as we know it

971
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,520
doesn't have an iron core but that

972
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,560
doesn't mean that it can't sustain life

973
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,690
at some point it's got not much of an

974
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,099
atmosphere but it's got some of an

975
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,570
atmosphere it's got all the basic

976
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,300
building blocks of life it just doesn't

977
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,369
necessarily have what it needs to keep

978
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:36,660
life that's the thing

979
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,790
iron silicate water and hydrogen okay

980
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,530
let's make it more water

981
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,560
let's make just a little more water

982
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,109
let's make it make it like that much

983
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:47,580
water so we got water there but it's

984
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,589
mostly ice right now so what we need to

985
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,300
do is we need to give it more iron as

986
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,940
well let's give it more iron one more

987
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:00,330
power of 10 more iron there we go now it

988
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,740
has an iron core

989
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,540
all right we're gonna turn climate on

990
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,330
just to give this simulation some oomph

991
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:11,230
huh so that is a start but in order to

992
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,750
do this more we're going to need to

993
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,970
figure out a way to get this thing a

994
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,770
magneto sphere now apparently there is a

995
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,750
way to create a magnetosphere but I'm

996
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,880
not a Harbison sure how to do it so I've

997
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,980
got it an iron core but I don't know if

998
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,970
that's gonna do anything to the

999
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,980
magnetosphere and in fact we've lost a

1000
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,730
lot of similarity to to earth but that's

1001
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,130
okay we had a chance of life before but

1002
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,380
it's all gone now but that's fine don't

1003
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,300
worry about that because we're gonna

1004
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,250
change this up for the better what we

1005
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,920
need to do is we need to add some carbon

1006
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,660
dioxide because what it doesn't have

1007
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,670
what it doesn't have it anyway

1008
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,630
is an atmosphere it needs an atmosphere

1009
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,210
it's got no atmosphere right now very

1010
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,100
none atmosphere in fact I think I

1011
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,540
accidentally destroyed all the

1012
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,650
atmosphere and that's why I can't do

1013
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,820
anything right now but I'm gonna add

1014
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,119
some atmosphere to it in fact I'm just

1015
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,300
gonna add some right here let's add a

1016
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,650
hundred thousand kilograms of atmosphere

1017
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,580
that's not gonna do a whole lot nope

1018
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,930
apparently we're not gonna add a hundred

1019
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,359
thousand kilograms of atmosphere maybe I

1020
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,920
just need to add carbon dioxide okay

1021
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,300
we're gonna add carbon dioxide we're

1022
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,880
gonna add a hundred thousand current

1023
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,040
kilograms of carbon dioxide at a time

1024
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,320
actually I'm going to restart this okay

1025
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,230
we're gonna start again oh let's go one

1026
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,060
hour at a time all right there we go

1027
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,760
that's a nice planet that's real nice

1028
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,520
right there that's a real nice planet so

1029
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,780
what we got here is we got a little

1030
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,530
problem it doesn't have nearly as much

1031
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,869
anything that we need and we do need it

1032
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:43,150
to have things so let's turn on the

1033
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,950
climate let's turn that on let's turn on

1034
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,450
the visualization of the magnetosphere

1035
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,390
which we don't have not yet anyway and

1036
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,250
let's change the composition to a little

1037
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,160
more iron and then there's water in

1038
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,330
there there is water in there

1039
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,100
let me just raise it up just a bit more

1040
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,750
there we go that's just enough water

1041
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,310
we're not gonna mess with the hydrogen

1042
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,750
because apparently that just blows up

1043
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,670
the atmosphere instantaneously and we're

1044
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,740
not gonna do that yet we have other

1045
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,570
things that we're going to do it will

1046
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,800
not just get

1047
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,410
as far as I know but life likelihood is

1048
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,500
now a little bit higher yeah oh that's

1049
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,300
pretty good so we need to give it more

1050
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,390
atmosphere so how do we do that so the

1051
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,300
temperature is going to be trending

1052
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,160
upwards what this is gonna need is is

1053
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,260
gonna need a lot more atmosphere than

1054
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,410
say other things have so let me see if

1055
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,900
adding carbon dioxide is just going to

1056
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,870
ruin this I also got to remember that a

1057
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,430
hundred thousand kilograms of anything

1058
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,900
is not a lot when it comes to the entire

1059
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,700
planet so let's add even more carbon

1060
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:53,090
dioxide there we go okay

1061
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,580
I gave it a magnetosphere cool well

1062
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,010
that's the first thing that we needed we

1063
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,050
definitely needed that so increasing

1064
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,110
chance of life has gone up a little bit

1065
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,270
alright so now we got to kick it up a

1066
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,930
notch

1067
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,150
we got we got kind of the basic cell but

1068
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,830
we got an atmosphere a little bit not

1069
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,540
not a lot of it and I mean we could have

1070
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,010
more atmosphere obviously and let's make

1071
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,920
a little more atmosphere here we go oh

1072
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,960
shit the greenhouse effect is real high

1073
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,720
on that that's probably too high what is

1074
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,190
let me let me compared to earth what is

1075
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,110
what is Earth's greenhouse effect on all

1076
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,990
that stuff ah okay good

1077
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,790
okay there we go I think that's just

1078
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,440
about right alright so we're getting

1079
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,010
better

1080
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,020
we've got definitely a denser atmosphere

1081
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,400
let's show that turn off the

1082
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,600
magnetosphere the surface temperature is

1083
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,150
not great but we can improve it by

1084
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,610
actually uh and this may sound

1085
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,260
counterintuitive but we can improve it

1086
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,770
by throwing things at the planet so

1087
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:51,320
we're gonna just throw a random asteroid

1088
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,300
never mind that was faster than I

1089
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,730
thought okay didn't think that was gonna

1090
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:59,270
be like that let's keep this down to the

1091
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:02,210
minute shall we okay random asteroid

1092
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:08,490
Chuck that bad boy over there

1093
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:14,019
boom all right so I'm gonna let that

1094
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,819
cook for a bit we're gonna let that cook

1095
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:20,049
toss it in the oven for a few days and

1096
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:22,329
she's gonna really think about that one

1097
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,099
and we're still going cold why are we

1098
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:26,740
going cold I was it cuz we're going

1099
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,170
farther away from the Sun okay so we're

1100
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,210
gonna need what is what is the surface

1101
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,890
pressure around ninety eight point two

1102
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,839
okay so we need to crank up the surface

1103
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:39,609
pressure of of Mars four boom one

1104
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:43,119
atmosphere on the dot at 1.01 that's

1105
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,490
better so now we're gonna have a much

1106
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,849
more pronounced greenhouse effect we're

1107
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:50,859
gonna be able to keep our temperature

1108
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:53,619
relatively good and then we can heat

1109
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:54,339
this bad boy up

1110
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:56,230
excuse all the pockmarks had some bad

1111
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,089
acne you know this is try small moon

1112
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:03,490
there we go surface temperature is

1113
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,700
higher BAM no one said this was easy

1114
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,119
okay I'm resetting whoa that is too much

1115
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:12,579
water okay that's way too much water

1116
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,079
all right let's tone down the water

1117
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,589
there gents tone down the water whoa on

1118
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:21,190
the water ease up on the water I don't

1119
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,019
know what that's all about but that's

1120
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:25,180
happening okay we've got the beginnings

1121
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,819
of clouds just the beginnings so what

1122
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:28,839
I'm going to do is I'm gonna increase

1123
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:30,519
the surface temperature to ten degrees

1124
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:33,970
Celsius that is a big shift from what it

1125
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,359
once was and it's got a little bit of an

1126
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,890
atmosphere to keep that but that doesn't

1127
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,680
mean that it's gonna stay that way

1128
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,119
we just took out the big ass scars and

1129
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,650
stuff but we're gonna ignore that I

1130
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,539
didn't actually need to do that but we

1131
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,160
are going to pretend like it was

1132
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,380
necessary all right and would you look

1133
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,599
at that we've got some clouds forming so

1134
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:56,440
it's still cold but it should be able to

1135
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,869
keep its temperature once it's able to

1136
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:02,410
start melting and and like growing some

1137
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,039
clouds clouds are reflective and stuff

1138
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,720
and they can keep it cool but also like

1139
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,769
the the engine of water changing it

1140
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:14,079
states can be self-sustaining in a way

1141
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,299
so hopefully that's going to help it in

1142
00:53:16,299 --> 00:53:18,700
the long run okay now I'm going to

1143
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,609
increase its mass

1144
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:22,619
now this may ruin everything else but

1145
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,979
I'm just gonna increase its mass by

1146
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:28,339
about double I'm gonna double its mass

1147
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:32,279
roughly so in doing that it changes up a

1148
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:34,199
lot of things about it suddenly the

1149
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,969
gravity is more intense is able to hold

1150
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:38,189
its atmosphere a little bit better you

1151
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,289
know what I mean so if it's able to hold

1152
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:43,049
its atmosphere better it'll lose less to

1153
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:46,920
the surrounding space it'll radiate out

1154
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,759
less the main problem with with Mars is

1155
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:52,890
that it doesn't necessarily get that

1156
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,400
much heat from the Sun you know what I

1157
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,699
mean

1158
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:59,069
so we're almost where we need to be the

1159
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,199
only problem now is it's not able to

1160
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:04,170
hold its temperature now in order to get

1161
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,079
it sold its temperature I'm hoping that

1162
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,449
adding carbon dioxide we'll be able to

1163
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:13,589
do such a feat if not well then we've

1164
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,239
got more of a problem but I think this

1165
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:18,269
should be able to help it along that's

1166
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:19,439
increasing its mess

1167
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:22,259
incredibly I raised this mass to earth

1168
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,499
levels which I don't go to bad I don't

1169
00:54:25,499 --> 00:54:27,479
know seems to be okay why is the

1170
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:29,309
greenhouse effect going down if I had

1171
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:31,410
carbon dioxide that's dumb oh that's

1172
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:46,730
dumb huh okay well no god damn it

1173
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:50,280
okay and that is about as good as I can

1174
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,770
get it I think I've gone why are we

1175
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,600
looking over there don't look over there

1176
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,220
you're gonna reveal my secret so I

1177
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,930
couldn't get it to have the right

1178
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,050
reflectivity if it was too far away from

1179
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,610
the Sun so I had to move it closer

1180
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,040
basically it's between Earth and Venus

1181
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,230
now not really practical but then again

1182
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,610
nothing else I was doing it was exactly

1183
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,470
practical like raising the mass of the

1184
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,000
entire planet but that's about it so I

1185
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,890
made life and anyway I'm gonna blow it

1186
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,480
up because I can't stand to even think

1187
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,200
about that so kaboom ah oh wow you were

1188
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,570
gone fast I was thinking that there was

1189
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,680
gonna be like a little more time but

1190
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,200
anyway earth let's look at earth blow up

1191
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,390
to say goodbye here so this has been

1192
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,740
universe an Box I've been playing around

1193
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,830
like way longer than I thought I would

1194
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,970
I've just been having a crazy amount of

1195

00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,540
what happen if you blew up a black hole

1215
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:24,210
oh whoa whoa I don't know what happened

1216
