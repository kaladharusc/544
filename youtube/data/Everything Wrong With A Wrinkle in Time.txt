[Music]

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,700
tomorrow m2 will wrinkle in time and

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,870
it's a nobody starts with a trip through

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,340
the clouds cliche Disney movie

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,320
immediately fulfills its prerequisite to

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,859
include at least one Chris oh they're

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,900
girly safety first if daddy pine was

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,980
just gonna let her take off her goggles

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,539
when something cool happen why'd he'd

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,640
give him to her in the first place yes

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,050
did I actually think she's worried not

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,460
only is she the daughter of two doctors

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,320
but she's nine and hopefully not under

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,579
any impression her parents don't love

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,110
her anymore because she opens some

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,239
fucking third-rate origami also origami

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,350
shadowing meg is that predictable then

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,850
that means this has happened many times

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,350
and therefore she shouldn't have to ask

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,170
Charles Wallace the question Charles

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,980
Wallace needs to be taught the

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,329
importance of putting all the condiments

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,590
back in the fridge or someone's getting

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,180
food poisoning for more mayonnaise and

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,280
sriracha tomorrow marks the four-year

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,769
anniversary of the disappearance of NASA

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,860
scientist dr. Alex Murray finally radio

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,990
broadcast is timely

29
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,540
and so begins movies incessant need to

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,340
punctuate every single moment with some

31
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,630
sort of pop song she's walking down a

32
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,979
hallway for pete's sake do we really

33
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,229
need Kalani's input on this Jesus I know

34
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,850
kids can be mean but this is a whole new

35
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,770
level the heart over the letter I might

36
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:31,200
be the most morbid part of this note

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,640
let's just generously assume that this

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,990
is the kind of gossip teachers would be

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,399
partaking in at this school you wouldn't

40
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,140
do a quick spot check for any offspring

41
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,490
around before you start running your

42
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,780
mouth it's not like he's hiding he's

43
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,280
sitting right there if Veronica wants to

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,869
be a true mean girl she really needs to

45
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,310
work on insults that have a little more

46
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,960
merit Charles Wallace was adopted and

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,460
therefore has no blood relation to any

48
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,840
other Murray family so absolutely

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
nothing runs in his genetic makeup that

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,140
would have come from that you're next

51
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,479
Charles Wallace what totally understand

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,619
you can't talk back to teachers but

53
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,149
considering the situation and the

54
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,649
anniversary of their death disappearance

55
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,090
they can't give one of the kids a break

56
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,670
all I'm saying is it's been four years

57
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,920
odds are he's not coming back maybe the

58
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,149
school counselor would say this to a

59
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,800
student but this is a harsh thing for a

60
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,060
principal to put out there doesn't he

61
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,319
know principals are supposed to be pals

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,890
it's right there in the spelling you

63
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,600
nicknamed her midlet really what about

64
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,209
Meg pie or Meg leg or Megamind or Mickey

65
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,160
sue or your Mixel and see nutmeg

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,079
anything is better than Meg --let yeah

67
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,519
well makers can't be choosers I guess

68
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,100
don't worry my friend Charles Wallace

69
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,540
looks old enough to understand why his

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,829
mom and sister are a little weirded out

71
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,269
if anything he should be surprised

72
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,130
they're not more weird out call me mrs.

73
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,880
wickley mrs. who no mrs. whatsit third

74
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,370
base just that there really is such a

75
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,220
thing as a desert act movie assumes

76
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,780
viewer has read a book or knows what a

77
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,820
tesseract is also is their Disney movie

78
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,150
that isn't in the MCU Veronica you

79
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,950
really don't trust easily do you

80
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,420
yes mrs. whatsit under the impression

81
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,310
that strained women who look like they

82
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,630
just arrived from the fanciest toga

83
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,260
party ever

84
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,700
up here super trustful yes we know Reese

85
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,130
we saw you in wild stop talking to

86
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,799
strangers I don't talk to them they talk

87
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,190
to me doesn't mean you have to answer

88
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,980
manners math I mean stranger danger

89
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,600
really isn't that hard of a concept even

90
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,220
for a six-year-old not sure what Charles

91
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,750
Wallace isn't grasping here don't be

92
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,350
like me

93
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,880
that's wrong a thing like yeah every

94
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,440
character in this film is either a dick

95
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
or has zero sense of what other people's

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,370
personal space is Calvin aren't you that

97
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,870
I am what are you doing here

98
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,940
I don't know and neither do we Calvin

99
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,760
neither do we you're cold here you're

100
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,530
good at a policy what do we need to pull

101
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,550
Missy for Charles Wallace

102
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,170
don't know and apparently neither does

103
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,490
the movie this has literally never

104
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,140
brought up again so these women are from

105
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,820
wrinkles in time or whatever but

106
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,380
currently they're just hanging around in

107
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,120
a world where the laws of physics matter

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,710
and therefore the book shouldn't stack

109
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:57,510
that way Calvin American that's racist

110
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,400
uses other people's words some might use

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
the same argument against the script for

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,430
this film also you have a character that

113
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,990
speaks only in other people's quotes and

114
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,460
that's the part you hire Mindy Kaling

115
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,050
for just need your mind

116
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,730
well these professional scientists

117
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,080
really act this rude at a presentation

118
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
are they all asshole ologists she's

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,380
gonna tell everybody that you are here

120
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,790
with me and I'm just trying to protect

121
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,980
your reputation yeah and she can also

122
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,150
hear you and see that you're acting

123
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,610
oddly so why keep giving her ammo

124
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,510
Wallace do this exactly

125
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,040
he's been supplying Meg with crazy

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,900
riddles and irritating the anniver but

127
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,610
if that was what mrs. whatsit who and

128
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,680
witch wanted then congratulations I

129
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,700
guess the final piece of the puzzle

130
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,770
pink pronoun game needs to end now these

131
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,240
people have confusing names and we get

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,980
that we've got that for the last 25

133
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,480
minutes move on

134
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,370
mrs. rich is a giant can no one else in

135
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,780
the neighborhood see this Baraka is

136
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,160
conveniently not poking your head out

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,990
our window also what about mrs. hoo and

138
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,730
mrs. whatsit are they just prancing

139
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,480
around the neighborhood with no

140
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,100
questions asked or can they just appear

141
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,480
like mrs. which does this movie have a

142
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,010
tesseract instead of the rules I'm

143
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,120
pretty sure that's the one question I

144
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,340
can answer is there such thing as the

145
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,710
wrong size don't answer that Charles

146
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,040
Wallace it's a trap my father

147
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,170
sure Magus weirded out by all this as

148
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,620
she should be

149
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,150
Charles Wallace has acted like a kid

150
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,770
who's going to grow up to be a serial

151
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,970
killer and these strange women wearing

152
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,380
bed linens keep showing up out of

153
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,730
nowhere but one mention of daddy and

154
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,200
she's fully on board because we're

155
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,700
almost half an hour in and we need to

156
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,200
get this wrinkling in time going that's

157
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,790
it this whole thing movie up to this

158
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,570
point has been throwing around

159
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,190
tesseracts and now when they finally

160
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,990
contested here we see Meg's eyes closed

161
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,000
her stuck in some goo and then she wakes

162
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,860
up she can be any size she wants why is

163
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,450
final fantasy Oprah so big I'm not

164
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,920
saying every strange visual choice has

165
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,300
to be explained but explaining some of

166
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,160
them might help ground this fantasy into

167
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,780
the story and characters instead of just

168
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,220
feeling like a giant game of we crazy

169
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,770
everyone knows that flowers are the best

170
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,050
customers in the entire universe which

171
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,310
is why Reese Witherspoon never gets

172
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,930
blackout drunk in a field because that

173
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,840
will be on TMZ the next day yes in

174
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,220
addition to understanding English these

175
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,570
flowers apparently have zoom and enhance

176
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,820
vision as well does that picture is tiny

177
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,260
and her finger is covering half of it

178
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,600
anyway color maybe we can interpret

179
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,950
whatever language these flowers are

180
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,500
using just get Nate actually unless

181
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,910
you're Tobias fume que most of us

182
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,500
occasionally do but don't worry boy whoo

183
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,970
I'm still not sure is actually in this

184
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,560
movie it's a Disney film so you're in no

185
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,880
danger of seeing misses what's it's

186
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,890
what's its

187
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,750
mrs. who knows mrs. whatsit though ma'am

188
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,920
has most likely seen it before

189
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,110
so why so surprised so the kids are

190
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,580
riding their new cabbage dragon past

191
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,170
giant Oprah Einstein in the direction

192
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,730
pointed out by the sentient floral

193
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,350
arrangement then somebody took all the

194
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,420
drugs considering Oprah's spent probably

195
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,500
her entire time in front of screens

196
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,090
looking at tennis balls and not much

197
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,450
else

198
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,530
maybe her vague expressionless

199
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,030
performance should be commended really

200
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,830
giant gravity defying priests tickles

201
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,270
it's like somebody watched avatar and

202
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,740
thought can we do the floating mountains

203
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,900
but a bit more like Donuts why would she

204
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,340
even try this it's one thing to have

205
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,780
faith when someone suggests it it's

206
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,190
another thing to completely just assume

207
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,480
you know the physics of a planet you've

208
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,650
never been to human male channel

209
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,030
character who literally wandered into

210
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,290
this movie off the street would be

211
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,310
excellent at cinemasins

212
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,580
it's called Camazotz home to a purely

213
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,780
evil energy known simply as the it so

214
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,820
it's the nothing meets Pennywise got it

215
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,500
man Pennywise is popping up in more

216
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,830
things this past year than cardi B well

217
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,570
Ryan I swear these different

218
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,130
environments are just cutscenes from a

219
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,780
game I have no desire to ever play

220
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,120
I don't feel or say anything when you

221
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,320
Tessa and you won't until you become one

222
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,170
with the universe jewel brow Oprah's

223
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,580
advice in this movie is like a Chris

224
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,260
Pratt acceptance speech without the

225
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,850
pooping advice or any actual substance

226
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,980
you look at the person if their natural

227
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,480
form is not humanoid then why is happy

228
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,220
medium looking all human if he wasn't

229
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,720
even expecting guests or knew who would

230
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,700
entered his domain I'm sorry mrs. which

231
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,470
I think we need to show her something

232
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,420
she needs to understand what's possible

233
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,280
because apparently traveling to other

234
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
dimensions and flying on the back of a

235
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,100
leaf caterpillar wasn't fucking enough

236
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,660
to convince her also if there was

237
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,920
something definitive that would convince

238
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,020
her to help out and find her dad then

239
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,600
why not start with that through darkness

240
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,770
the its reach spreads far beyond Oprah's

241
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,000
position being a warrior can you missus

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
which is peeping out so much in SPO

243
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
speech in this movie that slipped into

244
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Yoda speak she did your father sounds

245
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,160
like a a good man and how exactly do you

246
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,750
know that Zack literally the only thing

247
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,740
you've heard about her father is that

248
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,120
mrs. which thinks he can help fight the

249
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,620
it don't play like you know things you

250
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,840
don't know Galifianakis yeah like me

251
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,050
weirdo the beard live in a cave weirdo

252
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,370
with a beard living in a cave is

253
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,580
definitely my next band name ah

254
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,340
that's the frequency so the scientific

255
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,720
breakthrough depended on a motion that

256
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,280
sound you hear is a hundred thousand

257
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,720
actual scientists rolling their eyes at

258
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,550
the same time this is no longer a search

259
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,310
it's a rescue okay but when exactly does

260
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,690
it become an interesting movie pretty

261
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,130
sure there was a large imbalance of

262
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,550
costume changes to story in this movie

263
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,760
Camazotz

264
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,260
that's funny because just a couple

265
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,210
minutes ago I'm pretty sure you said we

266
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,460
can't test sir the Camazotz stick to

267
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,440
your own rules movie we must leave this

268
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,390
planet and we do not have the strength

269
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,460
to take you with us but we will somehow

270
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,930
have exactly the amount of strength it

271
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,100
takes to stick around just long enough

272
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,780
to give you this information and objects

273
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,770
you will need for the rest of this movie

274
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,710
my gift is my command that's not a gift

275
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,130
you stingy bossy which how is it even

276
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,360
possible that none of them were standing

277
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,950
in a spot one of the trees popped up

278
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,480
from these kids need to purchase lottery

279
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,770
tickets when they get back from tessarin

280
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:23,830
wait okay fine the kid likes to be

281
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,570
called by his full name but enough is

282
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,040
enough certainly someone like this

283
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,690
Calvin kid would slip up and just do it

284
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,150
Charles at least once so even though the

285
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,070
who what which and why is Gamora can't

286
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,200
be on this planet they all still walkie

287
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
talkie here and some echoey voices make

288
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
up your mind movie all right these kids

289
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,900
on their own or not I seem to have

290
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,040
forgotten the part in the book where the

291
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,150
kids run away from the smoke monster

292
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,700
lost also Megan Calvin have clearly gone

293
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,020
to the Prometheus school of running away

294
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,940
from things but why I'm not saying

295
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,650
Calvin and sobs here couldn't trust each

296
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,150
other I'm just saying the movie has done

297
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,710
zero in this first hour to help us

298
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,120
understand why they would have any

299
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,269
connection whatsoever

300
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,010
please survive this how did you do the

301
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,769
whole thing with the log just a physics

302
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,620
thing classic slingshot maneuver right

303
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,089
they teach it in physics right after the

304
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,740
surviving a nuclear bomb by riding it

305
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,000
out in the fridge lesson pretty sure

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,290
that was the character description for

307
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,640
the character of Calvin in the casting

308
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
call the intimidation tactics in this

309
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,320
neighborhood dodgeball match are off the

310
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,490
charts well you can't say Gloria Estefan

311
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,870
and the Miami Sound Machine didn't try

312
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,180
to warn it it is a sandwich zone thanks

313
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,720
for everything

314
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
you brought them right to us if they

315
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,839
just want to Charles Wallace this whole

316
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,130
time then why didn't they just come and

317
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,870
get all the missus GRU had no issue

318
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,279
getting the earth also did I miss

319
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,510
something why does it matter that his

320
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,040
eyes are red we only learned later that

321
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,690
the it infects its subjects with red

322
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,579
eyes and why is he showing Meg his eyes

323
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,930
at all I swear this movie thinks if it

324
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,519
can ask with cool visuals we will

325
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,019
somehow just go along for the rock also

326
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,180
why is he revealing himself at all can't

327
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,649
there just be one villain in the history

328
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,120
of movie kind that decides that it might

329
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,190
be beneficial not to be identified what

330
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,070
is he done T problem with Charlie

331
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,930
Wally's extremely sudden he'll turn here

332
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,310
is that he's already been fairly

333
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,570
annoying throughout this entire movie

334
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,709
and there hasn't been much of a

335
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,060
connection between him and Meg developed

336
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,350
anyhow oh and did I mention it's

337
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:28,290
extremely sudden so Charles Wallace just

338
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,970
went from overly gleeful to borderline

339
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,010
psycho in 60 seconds how exactly did

340
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,570
this happen because he passed the sam

341
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,810
test thank you also this could have been

342
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,370
the subtitle for the movie a wrinkle in

343
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,990
time a ridiculous journey with people

344
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,060
you barely know what do you see Papa

345
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,000
logic order fractal dimension another

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,410
science II sounding words duh damn it

347
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,000
movie this actually could have been the

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,709
only somewhat cool and emotional moment

349
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:57,120
in the film did we really need shot aid

350
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,250
come along and sadly sing lines from the

351
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,170
movie also wasn't she only seeing this

352
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,880
fractal dimension because she had her

353
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,410
whatsit goggles on how is she still

354
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,610
seeing it enough to make this trip

355
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,170
without them did she instantly memorize

356
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,579
the layout this is a trick considering

357
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,290
how many times he's probably been

358
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,790
tricked it makes sense that Alex would

359
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,680
think this but why doesn't make the last

360
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,540
25 minutes of this movie has pretty much

361
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,280
just been her getting bamboozled

362
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,930
he does realize his kid is a few years

363
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,160
older though right this shouldn't be too

364
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,740
hard to deduce if the CW could do this

365
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,240
then why didn't he do it just a few

366
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,980
seconds ago to keep Meg from going in

367
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,240
and finding their dad major character

368
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,890
gets possessed by a dark entity develops

369
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,630
superhuman powers and in a third person

370
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,980
grant claims they aren't here anymore

371
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,640
cliche the darkness how does he know

372
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,630
these arbitrary rules

373
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,370
is there a tessarin guidebook you

374
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,900
receive once you figure out the science

375
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,180
if the it's plan is to send a different

376
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,040
version of Meg back then why didn't the

377
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,360
same thing happen Alex I have to say out

378
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
of all the movies I thought this film

379
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
was still from The Exorcist wasn't one

380
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,770
of the but this is some of the best

381
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,580
counterfeit Pazuzu I've ever seen so

382
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,930
when they said you were going to be

383
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,580
taken by the darkness I didn't realize

384
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,560
they meant the screen would be so dark I

385
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,540
can't see anyone's face not that I need

386
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,460
to I'm sure Charlie boy is still looking

387
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,320
smug and evil and Meg still has that

388
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,630
confused weepy thing going on so carry

389
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:32,030
on so let me guess love is the answer

390
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,710
love will bring us together all we need

391
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,790
is love love is a many-splendored thing

392
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,890
I'm not even saying it's not worth

393
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,390
believing I'm just saying the movie is

394
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,310
keeping all this dark light evil love

395
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,720
stuff so surface that it doesn't even

396
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,010
have a chance to really resonate much

397
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,620
deeper than a fortune cookie Charles

398
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,620
Wallace your light has returned yeah but

399
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,390
the missus said specifically they could

400
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,560
not travel here because of all the

401
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,300
darkness right but hey convenient

402
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,090
semantics I'm so proud of you Meg the

403
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,820
universe is bright tonight because of

404
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,950
you why as mrs. who was still speaking

405
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,660
in her own words earlier she said it was

406
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,700
because the dark was weakening but isn't

407
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,750
she all empowered up now that the

408
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,339
darkness weakened this is why we leave

409
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,320
you not if I leave you first you can't

410
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,630

411

416
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,560
it isn't we saw mr. Murray tesslar back

417
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,850
when Meg wouldn't leave Charles Wallace

418
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,800
behind but how exactly did Calvin find

419
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,370
his way back

420
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,670
