1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,280
hey guys so the movie review is going up

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,959
very late this week should have been

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,569
Thursday night it's Sunday night that's

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,760
because we had some green screen white

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,160
balance even audio issues on this one

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,349
however we managed to fix it enough to

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,849
where I think it's acceptable to watch

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,640
and I really wanted to put this one up

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,410
instead of throw it completely in the

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,390
trash as a lost episode or something

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,670
because it's on a movie I I really

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,590
enjoyed Mandy with my best friend Nic

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,810
Cage in it I have to put it up here

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,609

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,340
collection so I hope you guys enjoy the

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,220
review alright check it out

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:45,360
[Music]

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,890
we just got back from Nicolas Cage's

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,430
Mandy this is a limited release in

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,210
theaters but I think it's so on Amazon

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,980
right now available streaming is would

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,250
you say $7.99 or something really yep

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,180
okay wow I didn't expect you to be able

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,290
to go out and see this because I was

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,490
gonna say come out and say this is a

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,500
film you can't see right now but

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:23,740
apparently you can ah wow this is an

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,530
experience it is not a film it's an

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,009
experience and whether you're on board

30
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,869
or not is going to depend on a lot of

31
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,610
different factors I have no idea how

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,140
these guys feel but I thought it was

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,409
fucking awesome now it's not a film for

34
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,149
everybody this is a trip man this is a

35
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:51,959
revenge flick with Nicolas Cage at his

36
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,310
maddest you know just blood-soaked

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,509
revenge film grindhouse style you can

38
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,569
definitely tell the inspiration of the

39
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:08,259
grindhouse stuff in the titles it's kind

40
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,680
of grainy around the light and the lens

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,879
definitely evokes the feeling of grand

42
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,690
house 70's and i now does it has some

43
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,660
problems okay but I'd say that this

44
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,340
towards the end of the second and third

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,569
act it is definitely worth seeing for

46
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,190
all that it is worth going through the

47
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,450
first act to get to this stuff because I

48
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,560
don't know of another film this year

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,500
that's there's quite like this I'm glad

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,989
I saw it on the big screen I don't think

51
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,879
this will work too well on your computer

52
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,720
I think you need to be on the big screen

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
Wow okay I'm gonna let these guys and

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,950
then I'll talk more about how I feel I

55
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,989
really enjoyed it and if you can buy

56
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,239
this on Amazon go out and see this thing

57
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,620
no it is very gruesome very bloody and a

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,530
very slow burn

59
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,490
but quite an experience it's an arthouse

60
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,750
film yeah it had everything this movie

61
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,770
had absolutely everything there was

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,100
there was a tiger there was there's some

63
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,180
drugs Tigers a chainsaw fights a knife

64
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,910
dildo craziest biker

65
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,819
yeah Hellraiser biker people there was a

66
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,180
penis oh I remember that there was a lot

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,739
of dead people

68
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,730
blood explosions everything don't forget

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,840
the chainsaw bye it was kind of trippy

70
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,720
there I checked my watch a watery trip

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
yeah how can you not like a film that

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,150
has all of those I didn't like it I'm

73
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,590
just saying so and I checked my watching

74
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,300
that a lot in the first 45 minutes not

75
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,340
because I was bored at all but because I

76
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,140
knew I wanted to be able to say the

77
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,080
first 45 minutes nothing happens but

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,390
it's super trippy and it like it sucks

79
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,930
you in

80
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,430
he's you like when is stuff gonna start

81
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,840
happening and all of those like weird

82
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,150
visuals and then they keep reading from

83
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,250
like sword and sorcery books that I love

84
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,959
and then there's heavy metal playing and

85
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,450
then weird stuff happens and then this

86
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,100
story really happens so it's it's kind

87
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,780
of slow in the begin oh yeah it's like

88
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,790
individual when I first entered the

89
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,989
movie I was like I don't know what it's

90
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:30,810
about and like an hour in it's beautiful

91
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,060
they use a lot of reds they've used a

92
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,910
lot of Blues a lot of lens flares they

93
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,300
have a few some animation which I that's

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,380
one part I felt didn't really work yeah

95
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:53,820
it's very stylistic yeah okay and in

96
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,500
that sense I understand it and I

97
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,960
appreciated it but I knew those visuals

98
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,570
that they did in the cartoon it almost

99
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,700
felt to me as a way to get around the

100
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,470
budget you know what I mean because if

101
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,120
those films would have been done in

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,950
live-action it would have been so

103
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,260
haunting so creepy except for the final

104
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,370
one if I don't want I'm not sure

105
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,080
you would do but see that's what you

106
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,150
could do in cartoon you could do crazy

107
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,080
thing in cartoon form but oh man so like

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,150
I said it's very visually appealing

109
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,340
though are there there are some shots

110
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,440
where I think the director gets a little

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,020
bit too creative some shots are a little

112
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,030
fuzzy with some little weird things

113
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,639
obscuring I'm like get in the flame in

114
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,350
my face get I can't see I'm trying to

115
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,479
focus on this really interesting shot

116
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,419
that you've set up but I'd say 80% of

117
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,550
the shots are just fascinating to look

118
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,310
at ah and I will say the film is

119
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,280
definitely somewhat self-indulgent

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,250
where it really holds on some of those

121
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,030
shots he's like mmm smell my shit and

122
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,110
and I'm like no spirit of good yeah you

123
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,180
know what I mean but it is shit do you

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,639
think you could get it out of my face

125
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,050
yeah that was a really bad analogy but

126
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,120
you know what I'm saying it was very

127
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,419
interesting and he knew that he was

128
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,220
setting something interesting up and for

129
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,560
like I said 80% of the shots have worked

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,520
out but man I saw the trailer so I was

131
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
fully prepared for something trippy and

132
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,340
a revenge flick and Nicolas Cage this is

133
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,520
Nicolas Cage his best performance in a

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,639
long-ass time it plays to his strengths

135
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,360
this character barely talks he it's miss

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
it's it's mostly emotion it's mostly

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:46,260
craziness nobody does these are these

138
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,930
crazy mad man things with his eyes and

139
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,680
and and these screams like Nicolas Cage

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,840
does and it's just fucking this is a

141
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,970
really fantastic time it's a pill and it

142
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,750
is a pill that's hard to have - yeah

143
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,510
it's hard to swallow at times but you

144
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,610
kind of are like I'm glad I took that

145
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,740
freaking pill by the end I don't know

146
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,599
about y'all but I really enjoyed the

147
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,969
film you know but I really would

148
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,740
probably cut some here this is

149
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,500
like almost like a two-hour adventure

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,590
and and some of those shots that linger

151
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,520
and hold if you start getting more

152
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,080
modern with the cuts because I think a

153
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,270
lot of the seventies films they have

154
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,610
long lingering shots and I think kind of

155
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,349
that's what he's throwing back to and

156
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,870
also he thinks his compositions are good

157
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,539
which they are and this lighting is

158
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:49,660
fascinating which they are I don't like

159
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,490
saying this but you know almost every

160
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,889
frame is a little bit of art and I know

161
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,569
that they must have filmed it and he

162
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:56,860
looked at and he said okay this looks

163
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,970
good but we need to make the light and

164
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,949
go like this it's fucking art every

165
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,840
frame and this every scene you feel the

166
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,370
inspiration for a lot of the scenes like

167
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,349
their scenes worth like this is you know

168
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,940
like the chainsaw scene you're like all

169
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,229
right I'm definitely getting some

170
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:09,789
Leatherface this is what and there's

171
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,349
scenes where it's like this is a hundred

172
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,090
percent Hellraiser I'm looking at the

173
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,440
scene yeah you get some inspiration

174
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,780
you're like oh man this is this is that

175
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,340
this is what it feels like and he's not

176
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,409
stealing this scene by any means he's

177
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,720
made it his own but there are things in

178
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,000
the scenery that he puts in the shot

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,159
that you're like okay I get where he's

180
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:27,759
coming from

181
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,849
it's really good very simplistic story

182
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,159
it's basically just a guy getting

183
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,479
revenge okay you know from a crazy call

184
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:49,450
from a crazy cult leader yeah yeah just

185
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,910
like I hate this guy but it's a good

186
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,370
ability it's a good kind of hate you can

187
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,000
see his tortured soul you can see the

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,339
bullshit behind it but yet you can also

189
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,940
see that he buys into it and and they

190
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,950
make this character deep without really

191
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,950
over explaining everything there are

192
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,649
these sort of artifacts that the this

193
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,779
cult uses and and when you're first

194
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,070
watching the film you layer these things

195
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,350
real like what the fuck is it and you

196
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,520
get closer look I don't know it won't

197
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,350
spoil anything we'll talk about spoilers

198
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,720
afterwards but everyone in the movie is

199
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,089
on drugs in which helps explain a lot of

200
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,100
right

201
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,890
there there's a there's lots of elements

202
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,630
in the movie and I think this one

203
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,740
deserves a reward sure it ties into a

204
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,560
book that she's reading at some point I

205
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,300
don't know if it's an actual novel that

206
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,000
I could go out and and seek out but you

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,860
know or if it was just a fictional novel

208
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,710
created for this universe but yeah

209
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,340
there's lots of really fascinating shots

210
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,590
the action is done well

211
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,050
the revenge storyline is done well it is

212
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,100
bloody it is gory it is satisfying it's

213
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,280
hard to take your eyes off of and I'm

214
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,770
struggling to come up with some

215
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,860
negatives the performance is from

216
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,650
Nicolas Cage fantastic performance from

217
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,890
the cult leader he was in the trailer he

218
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:21,880
was in predator he's also again anytime

219
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,190
guy when he cuts his face with the razor

220
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,530
and predator he's in this room oh my god

221
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,710
it's so good and he's like yeah I'm

222
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,910
gonna have a bigger role because he was

223
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,830
in the trailer but I mean his rows

224
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,480
affected it's good to see him come back

225
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
and in a film I hadn't seen him in

226
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,750
forever and he sort of gives a little

227
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,060
context to this little universe that

228
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,550
setup gives a little backstory kind of

229
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,550
gives a little reality and but I like

230
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,650
how the film sort of blurs the line

231
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,420
between sort of you know is he on a drug

232
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,750
trip or is he in reality and I don't

233
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,240
think it doesn't do it an annoying way I

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,970
think this is all set in reality yeah

235
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,440
you know and but it's so hyper stylized

236
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,680
it's so you know the the way it's

237
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,380
presented into you it feels mystical it

238
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,430
feels far more profound and and deep

239
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,470
than this simple story than it really is

240
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,560
so I think the director came in here

241
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
with a vision he executed it perfectly

242
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,070
till the way he wanted and it really

243
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,710
comes across and it's so fascinating and

244
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,060
I'm thinking about a little different

245
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,850
parts of the scenes that stand out that

246
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,680
were memorable I want to go and seek

247
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,960
this guy's other films out I think

248
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,600
that's how Nicolas Cage got in

249
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,610
I think it was Elijah Wood Wood was a

250
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,710
producer of the film and told him about

251
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,290
it read this script it's and yeah and

252
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,110
and Nicolas Cage's saw the film the the

253
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,180
directors previous film and he's like I

254
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,390
want to be on board but yeah great

255
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,240
performances it's crazy I mean the only

256
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,070
what are some negatives there was some

257
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,930
interjections of humor that some of them

258
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,820
really appropriate and I liked and then

259
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,280
the summit's at times where you're in a

260
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,260
really intense moment and then the

261
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,020
character says something that is kind of

262
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,360
odd man it almost doesn't fit the scene

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,310
and it's not quite believable and it's

264
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,360
really funny and like everyone the

265
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,590
theater was laughing but it's like that

266
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,450
almost feels inappropriate and I'm

267
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,690
grasping at things too like there this

268
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,940
movie a lot of people hate I'm not one

269
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,590
of them a lot of people like your mom

270
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,180
doesn't want to see this movie don't

271
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,610
take her go see like if you can mom

272
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,950
won't like grandma won't like it the

273
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,650
internet internet naysayers won't let

274
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,690
you know when somebody's like if you do

275
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,760
if you if you find arthouse films

276
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,220
annoying or slower paced films annoying

277
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,350
I think it's gonna be easy there's just

278
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,230
way too much charm for Nicolas Cage and

279
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,730
this revenge shown by the end of the

280
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,750
film and you're not convinced you're

281
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,570
just a no I'm not buying any of that you

282
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,520
know cuz you know I saw a few reviews

283
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,230
cuz I had to look it up I was like oh my

284
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,030
gosh you know what do people think about

285
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,940
the film and you know this is what an

286
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,380
boring and self-indulgent yes it is it's

287
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,260
all those things so you're right but and

288
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,830
but it turned it manages to overcome all

289
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,680
of those things those things make it

290
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,620
unique this is unlike any other film

291
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,240
you'd find in theaters in fact it's not

292
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,030
in theaters I mean I wish we still got

293
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,950
films like this that were so different

294
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,320
from mainstream films you know this is

295
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,050
much different from national treasure

296
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,750
national treasure 3 somebody done a lot

297
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,160
of drugs but it's and it's also good as

298
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,250
a huge fan of Nicolas Cage I don't know

299
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,160
if you guys know you know I think he's

300
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,580
I'm big fan and especially he's a fan of

301
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,610
Superman as well and he's done a lot of

302
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,280
crappy films direct-to-dvd kinda

303
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,560
he's throwing offices Conair he also did

304
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,620
great with some of the greatest films

305
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,740
and and he brings it it shows you man

306
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,910
this guy has jobs he still got it he can

307
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,570
captivate you and without Nicolas Cage I

308
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,180
don't know how this movie wouldn't have

309
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,460
worked as well for me if it was a

310
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,250
Nicolas Cage in that role I don't think

311
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,290
Brian exactly this kind of this kind of

312
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,210
you know indie heart arthouse but you

313
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,220
need to see this if you're a fan of

314
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,740
Nicolas Cage if you're a fan of revenge

315
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,600
fills if you're a fan of grindhouse

316
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,280
bloody gory things but not too much that

317
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,910
and and visual you know artistry and and

318
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,240
when trippy weirdness you're really

319
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,050
gonna like it

320
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,500
be prepared for full-frontal PP there's

321
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,840
PP in the field there's a tiger and make

322
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,820
up for it tiger then there's also like a

323
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,170
way dildo lamb and a whole bottle of

324
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:05,920
yeah yes just crazy and it's one film

325
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,410
see we had a choice between the house

326
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,200
with the clock in its walls which I

327
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,730
thought looked a little too kitty and

328
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,270
assassination nation which were like

329
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,310
Instagram the social media I'm a little

330
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,080
fascinated as you know from Angry Joe

331
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,790
side of things being and like an online

332
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,430
kind of my life is online I kind of want

333
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,500
to see but and those may be great films

334
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,200
but I'm telling you Mandy is so

335
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,260
satisfying so different that you either

336
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,010
gonna hate it

337
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,510
or you're gonna love it there is no

338
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,580
in-between on this and I think there

339
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,560
should be if you're anything like us or

340
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,470
me I can't speak for these guys your

341
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,350
love it so let's um let's do some final

342
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,720
verdicts and then let's jump into the

343
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,390
spoiler section so so in the car ride

344
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,810
home I was trying to understand how I

345
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,930
felt about this film mm-hmm and I really

346
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,930
did enjoy it but it was just so weird I

347
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,240
guess we just haven't seen someone like

348
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,060
this in a long time I it was hard to put

349
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,810
into words

350
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,470
like the first part was slow but I was

351
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,980
still captured by the visuals I didn't

352
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,600
hate it oh we didn't mention the

353
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,529
soundtrack

354
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,249
did you like yeah just talking fucking

355
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:24,309
Alex about I want to get it's not get

356
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,920
stuck in your head very good with that

357
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,480
being said though like I really liked

358
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,100
the movie especially towards the end I

359
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,559
start picking up more and there's no

360
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,059
there's not one of those films are you

361
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,980
watch like back-to-back this is one that

362
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,660
you sit on and you think about for a

363
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,850
little bit okay seven out of ten Alex

364
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,249
what are you thinking I don't know why

365
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,339
act 1 it's hard to rate having ones like

366
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:53,559
a four or five because I thought it

367
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,730
would drag down a little

368
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,129
I'm loving this by the way cuz II V it

369
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,100
so it I it's almost like they he showed

370
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,529
me what he can do with like I don't know

371
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,659
if it was an old camera or if it was

372
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,400
like an effect that used on a new camera

373
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,559
and like there was a lot of really cool

374
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,240
scenes where you see like there's

375
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,980
feathers and flames and a sunset and

376
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,390
then hair and they're all like morphing

377
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,730
back and back and forth lasted for 45

378
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,490
minutes and after about 15 20 minutes

379
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,010
I get it you're really good but lets you

380
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,510
know like I we got stuff but we got to

381
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,649
sell it there's old there's like more

382
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:25,539
Nic Cage to detect to have in front of

383
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,510
us and so I didn't hate it and I think

384
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,860
that was like fairly average so like

385
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,870
that's like a five and then we get into

386
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,280
the second act like what the story gets

387
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,539
going the story is actually really kind

388
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,280
of compelling like this the the

389
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,710
characters are like memorable like

390
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,570
you're gonna remember the Charles Manson

391
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,149
character for a while like bad that guy

392
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,350
was really really good all of his

393
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,940
lackeys were really really good and you

394
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,909
bought that they would do any the world

395
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,860
is they build to your nice yes

396
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,570
fascinating yeah and then in the third

397
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,460
act you get this completely wild

398
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,929
different movie that you would not

399
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,990
expect from act 1 or 2 where you're on

400
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,260
like it's like John wick on LSD is what

401
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,909
the third act of this movie was like

402
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:05,950
people are getting hit with axe no guns

403
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,440
like there's a tiger there's a blade

404
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,570
dildo again there was like it was in the

405
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,190
movie for like spy whether plane dance

406
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,080
but it was real weird and it's just like

407
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,800
you shit in there

408
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,690
it was like a part of like a really big

409
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,610
part and then there's a blood explosion

410
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,300
a couple of them yeah a lot of joints no

411
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,160
no wow look at all of this stuff is in

412
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
the trailer other than the full-frontal

413
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,330
amazing you don't wanna read it and

414
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,160
that's why I love this I said I love

415
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,990
this because these guys are so used to

416
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,640
watching mainstream films they have no

417
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,530
fucking idea how to read I'll tell you

418
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,660
how to rated well you still gotta give

419
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,380
you ready but did the director do what

420
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,400
he set out to do was his creative vision

421
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,780
executed yeah but I think a lot of

422
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,610
directors do that but it doesn't mean it

423
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,740
is that does their vision translate it

424
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,810
to what I want to see is more apart like

425
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,100
is the question I need to ask as a

426
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,900
critic as someone who wants to see a

427
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,150
film and a fan of film yes you wanted to

428
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,950
make national treasure too

429
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,630
I don't give a shit now movies probably

430
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,310
garbage I didn't want to watch it and

431
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,650
they probably did everything that they

432
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,720
wanted to do in that film this one he

433
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
did probably did everything he wanted to

434
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,590
do and we disagreed on a lot of scenes

435
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,540
where it's like nope that cut that

436
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,920
that's horrible I would never put that

437
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,590
if I were making this movie but I wasn't

438
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,840
here or this film here so there'd be a

439
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,460
lot of differences between how I would

440
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,900
handle certain seasoned humor was one of

441
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,490
the things that I thought was kind of

442
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,260
interesting like you're always gonna be

443
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,700
able to make a better movie in your mind

444
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,850
that's I think that's a little unfair

445
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,320
but you have to say was he trying to

446
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,710
convey something but I don't know you're

447
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,900
a lot your what you said was did he do

448
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,310
what he wanted to do and I think a lot

449
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,290
of I think I'm a little more than that

450
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,510
obviously you know yeah but was it

451
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,460
entertaining did it captivate you did

452
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,200
you believe this world were you pulled

453
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,620
in

454
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,900
were you in gross oh yeah yes for sure

455
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,660
oh is this a legendary film though like

456
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,070
I don't even think that this isn't one

457
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,210
where I'm gonna be like everyone needs

458
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,310
to go out and see this film I could I I

459
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,960
think it's probably better than a seven

460
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,130
in my mind I think it's gonna be an

461
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,680
eight I think it's good I need to go see

462
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,380
it an 8 out of 10 then yeah ok so so my

463
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,150
that's where I was thinking I want to

464
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,240
give it an 8 out of 10 but I feel like a

465
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,790
9 I'm moving towards a 9 and it's

466
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,100
because I'm a huge fan of Nicolas Cage

467
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,820
this is

468
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,249
this is right now you can get it on on

469
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:29,149
Amazon

470
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:32,179
apparently on-demand or live streaming

471
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,940
or whatever but you know it's a welcome

472
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,889
change of pace it's a really excellent

473
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,139
role that he's selected I think it was

474
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:43,820
well done and but you're right and and I

475
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,519
have to come come down because we watch

476
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,840
these things we're like five minutes

477
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,759
from watching this yeah so this is one

478
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,859
of those feels really hard to talk to

479
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,960
you about five minutes after seeing it

480
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,450
because there's lots of imagery here

481
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,669
there's lots of you know you know things

482
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,950
that you can find on bronze second

483
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,409
reflection and second watching so I'm

484
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,210
gonna end on an eight out of ten I think

485
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,859
it's an eddy out of ten with potential

486
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:12,139
for a nine out of ten if you trim the

487
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,019
film up a little bit it is you know

488
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:17,690
self-indulgent in parts but I'm glad I

489
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,090
watched that self-indulgent once now

490
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,249
it's almost like Blade Runner 2099 or

491
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,109
whatever if you go back and watch that

492
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:26,210
film you're like this is great but boy

493
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,299
does it really stretch out and so this

494
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:30,830
one's gonna be a little harder to watch

495
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,989
on repeat viewings without a little bit

496
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,859
more you know the pacing the humor I

497
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,749
thought was great we can talk about that

498
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,700
in the spoilers but eight out of ten

499
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,909
it's a badass suit a lot of approval on

500
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,070
this one if you're go out and see this

501
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,440
I recommend it all right and it's only

502
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,539

523
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,900
spoil right it's very very simple magic

524
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,790
we have magic blue no it was a plastic

525
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,570
ocarina

526
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,150
no no she always liked with metal or

527
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,030
something rock yes okay it was it was

528
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,800
plastic but maybe it was a rock in the

529
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,370
film but it was just a crappy but Oh

530
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,060
Joey's a little bit so over the top like

531
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,290
no they heard that shit especially

532
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,150
that's their area that they roam around

533
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,600
here okay so a crazy asshole it's funny

534
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,370
they label the acts in this film the

535
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,440
first act is called like the shadowy

536
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,080
mountains second act is the children of

537
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,850
the new dawn that's where we meet these

538
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,580
cultures and they basically see your

539
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,100
walls they basically see her while she's

540
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,890
walking around and that's how this cult

541
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,870
leader gets obsessed with her and wants

542
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,980
her and then obviously you know shit

543
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,840
gets kicked into high gear and in that

544
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,690
last part is called Mandy the third act

545
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,150
but yeah the cult leader captures this

546
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,790
we see a little bit of Nicolas Cage he's

547
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,150
a he's a for D for a forests what is

548
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,880

549
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,840
sober lumberjack sober lumberjack and he

550
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,910
lives out in a really creative looking

551
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,860
house his wife seems to be an artist of

552
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,170
some kind she draws their really nice

553
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,330

Allison and live alone out in the forest

555
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,910
and obviously when you have crazies in a

556
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,690
fucking van driving by you're fucked I

557
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,450
mean these people this cult leader just

558
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,700
wants her and he sends his crazy called

559
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,670
people after her but but first he

560
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,090
summons these these creatures Hellraiser

561
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,350
guys this is where you get a little bit

562
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,790
fucking loved it because I love L raiser

563
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,750
except for like all the sequels

564
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,720
Hellraiser one

565
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,090

567
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,110
is that - and that's - yeah

568
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,820
so the first three can have their own

569
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,830
things but the rest nothing anyway so

570
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,840
these biker guys who love pain

571
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,299
apparently they're explained I mean it's

572
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,289
not demons they are just real bikers

573
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,230
that there's a new LSD yes they got up

574
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,659
they got a bad batch of LSD and it ate

575
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:05,090
them nuts right and so they love pain

576
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,919
and they go around murdering and killing

577
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,490
people and and somehow they get summoned

578
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,220
by this law ocarina of time thing this

579
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,679
little fucking flute summons them to do

580
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,570
their bidding and it's blood for blood

581
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,640
so they sacrifice one of the cult

582
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
members the fat kid on the cult member

583
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840

and go get this lady for us and they

585

590
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,870
cult leader is in this robe and he just

591
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,120
did this whole monologue about how

592
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:52,460
fuckin Grady is musician Manson story

593
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,710
where you just once everyone loved him

594
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,700
and they make her do drugs

595
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,070
and he pulls his fuckin robot little

596
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,530
foot penis right here and there is just

597
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,179
hanging out there like god damn it and

598
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,580
and but here's the greatest part after

599
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,260
it goes through the spiel and he's like

600
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,640
you need to love him you need to be with

601
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,220
me and I'm giving you this opportunity

602
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,730
she's fucking sir or no she asks is this

603
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,130

605
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,960

606
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
man well the entire men that's where the

607
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,190
movie gets trippy as fuck like it was

608
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,110
already trippy but she is laughing

609
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,020
almost demonically laughing and it might

610
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,179
be because she got fuckin stung by a

611
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,760
fucking I don't know what it gave her a

612
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,980
bunch of LSD and then they gave a long

613
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,470
snake in a story with the wostow took

614
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,659
make her more high and then the entire

615
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:43,130
movie she's wearing like Motley Crue

616
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,610
shirts

617
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,559
Black Sabbath and a bunch of metal

618
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,000
shirts and then he's playing like

619
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,260
something that's almost like the

620
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,950
Carpenters like bulky 70s so of course

621
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,700

622
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,110
just starts laughing at him but she's

623
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,090
lost laughs at him at when he like whips

624
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,850
it out oh yeah freaks out and it's super

625
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,680
fun it's so great because it Pierce's

626
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,330
him I mean that's that's the greatest

627
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,950
thing to do you're captured you can't do

628
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,990
anything you want to hurt them and she

629
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,030
manages to hurt him a lot and it

630
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,950
completely shatters him he's in front of

631
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,390
a mirror like what do I do you know and

632
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,730
he decides he's gonna fucking kill the

633
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,310
dude or stab the dude with this mystical

634
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,440
knife or whatever which I wish kind of

635
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,120
had more to it because there's a go I

636
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,850
wonder if maybe this figures into the

637
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,310
plot later it doesn't I wish it did and

638
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,320
then he burns her alive in a fucking bag

639
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,060
and all of his creepy dudes all right

640
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,330
yeah like fucking and you know goatee

641
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,610
lingering shot oh it's great

642
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,490
but creepiest spot and that's it that's

643
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,410
the store and then fucking Nicolas Cage

644
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,260
is like hoho you know make him watch

645
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,300
they make him watch then he breaks free

646
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,270
believe we're dead drinking vodka

647
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,330
screaming and this is where you say some

648
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,760
of the jokes some of the comedy seems

649
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,070
kind of oddly time when his wife was

650
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,790
dead and he she basically falls into ash

651
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,610
in his arms he goes into his house and

652
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,350
just so happens there's a commercial

653
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,480
playing and it's played for comedic

654
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,030
value it's just fucking commercial with

655
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,000
goblin macaroni and shit was super funny

656
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,840
[Applause]

657
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,250
listen I can know as never remember

658
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,960
scenes and films and I'm like damn on

659
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,040
that review I want to say this but

660
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,110
everything is so fucking crystal clear

661
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,080
for me in smell and and so you're

662

looking good or whatever and and and

664
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,110
then he's like I forget what he says he

665
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,850
was like or I couldn't hear what he said

666
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,290
it was like something about goblins I'm

667
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,230
a Garland he said like oh my god and he

668

672
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,080
not sure where it died but it so I was

673
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,000
explaining this funny scene with the

674
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Goblin

675
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,800
see that didn't bother you didn't bother

676
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,060
me all that much yeah I like that part

677
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,010
yeah they kind of broke things up a

678
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,240
little bit so what was the comedy

679
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,770
interjecting that you didn't like the

680
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,260
last 30 the last minute of the thing

681
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,480
he's got the cult leader in his head in

682
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,100
his hands and the cult lady was kind of

683
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,390
having a mental breakdown he's like oh

684
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,070
you how dare you I'm a golden God don't

685
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,280
do this and then he goes he's he goes

686
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,860
into he's like starting to beg for his

687
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,140
life and then he looks at him and he's

688
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,730
he's a butt braid this man's gonna kill

689
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,830
him and he's he had a head thrown on him

690
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,750
earlier like he's terrified and then he

691
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,600
just says like I'll suck your dick

692
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,610
that was funny I was like I wonder if

693
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,230
any of these people are gonna beg for

694
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,090
their life like in that second yeah it

695
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,130
was odd but it's I was waiting for it

696
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,950
and it happen it's the most it's the the

697
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,630
the most important scene of the whole

698
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,190
film where he only gets what he wants

699
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,650
and then that's that's kind of like the

700
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,780
the bad guys response it factored in for

701
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,380
me is he's a fraud no I get that he's a

702
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,600
fraud he he obviously isn't the golden

703
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,330
God and why he goes throughout the movie

704
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,270
he goes through wrathful God or he's

705
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,280
screaming and being he has kind of like

706
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,620
the the Christian Bale Batman voice that

707
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,850
comes out every now and that's kind of

708
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,190
not not great but he's screaming at all

709
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,810
of his followers and goes like oh no but

710
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,970
I'm nice and so he's going through this

711
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,570
like transformation the right before he

712
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,790
gets his head smashed open but I don't I

713
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,990
don't know I mean everyone was laughing

714
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,670
at it's like this is kind of an odd time

715
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:35,220
to have a lot of the comedy was

716
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,230
sprinkled in nicely but yeah there I

717
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,030
mean I could see some people find it a

718
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,410
little awkward and wanting a little bit

719
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,330
more sad you know scream like smoke

720
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,800
that's a serious moment in the film

721
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,590
maybe and I was like man how the fuck

722
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,970
are they gonna wrap this up after he

723
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,950
crushes his head and he just walks he

724
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,050
gets in his car and the sound stops and

725
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,370
you're like oh shit is he gonna say

726
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,960
something funny and I was like that

727
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,030
would be an inappropriate comedy moment

728
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,180
if he was like Jesus freaks or something

729
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,240
like that but it is they do have a

730
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,460
moment of levity there and it's you know

731
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,500
he looks over and his wife is sitting

732
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,340
there

733
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,070
and he's you know he's like excited and

734
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,480
just like it was smiling

735
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,700
that's the goofy make his face crazy

736
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,550
smile and I was like alright that well

737
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,630
be great Bobby and covered cocaine and

738
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,930
cocaine because he uses the same LSD as

739
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,850
the rest of those guys do you think he

740
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,970
ate the jar of gray drugs yeah he took

741
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,760
he took me you know he did one fucking

742
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,910
taste puts him on this crazy acid trip

743
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,040
but I wonder if he fucking drank that

744
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,300
shit let the rest of them just

745
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,370
off-screen nobody took enough to get

746
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,640
high off LSD yeah ice we saw the white

747
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,120
powder we saw there's great green goo

748
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,590
and then every time they show one of the

749
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,150
artifacts they've got this fucking green

750
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,730
strobe light fuck is it so like I said

751
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,040
sometimes it's self-indulgence sometimes

752
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,740
he's trying to do you know imagery

753
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,840
things that don't quite work out and

754
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,800
you're like oh yeah

755
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,270
well the green pulsing they explained in

756
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,350
the beginning in the movie when she's

757
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,910
reading her book it talks about the

758
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,700
wizard pulling out like the eye of

759
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,920
something everything from and it's

760
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,810
pulsing pulsing for God that's why

761
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,640
there's that animated she wears the

762
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,470
reapers common the other Reapers coming

763
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,270
she pulls like in the animated scene she

764
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,480
pulls a Jim out of like the beastie and

765
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,180
it's pulsing green so so anything

766
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,640
mystical if they tie they tied it in but

767
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,960
I mean they did explain anything about

768
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,550
it just like it's good yes it's a

769
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,680
plastic sortie at Stanford I just loved

770
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,020
they had some great matte paintings in

771
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,830
this you know the quarry which when when

772
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,140
it fucking pans up the quarry sort of

773
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,340
turns into an other earth otherworldly

774
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,880
jagged edge rocky different planet

775
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,070
plaintiffs fear and it just fucking

776
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,530
looked awesome and I was like man this

777
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,250
is one of those like cool ass grindhouse

778
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,640
this films got style god style got great

779
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,930
performances kind of ruin felt out of

780
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,960
place for me was a tiger I know

781
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,820
everything was weirdest but yeah but the

782
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,010
tight so let's talk about that scene I

783
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,970
really explained that this drug dealer

784
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,790
senses Nicolas Cage in the back and then

785
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,130
he starts he was a drug did he was a guy

786
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,240
making all the

787
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,970
oh I was like who the fuck is this guy

788
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,309
yeah so basically he starts having a

789
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:30,029
conversation with himself kind of well

790
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,799
he does LSD first the first thing he

791
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,510
does is lick his own finger so he gets

792
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,480
high and then oh that explains the man

793
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,820
just staring him down and he's just

794
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,070
having a conversation he's like yeah

795
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,779
you're right you're right you're totally

796
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,750
right nothing and says nothing the

797
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,710
entire time Joe don't you understand you

798
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,390
can't cage the tiger

799
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,350
yeah Nicolas Cage is this tiger and he

800
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,120
sees him roaming free doing his thing

801
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,059
man and then he sees the tiger like he's

802
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,620
like you're right

803
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,549
I can't exactly I don't know thank you

804
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:07,500
for joining get that I was like who the

805
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,359
fuck is this guy he ran him on his

806
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,190
journey murdering all the people in

807
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,619
satisfying ways I mean there's a lot of

808
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,030
people who look for him to murder on

809
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,369
this revenge thing let's try to get

810
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:21,659
through some of them he shoves this axe

811
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,639
thing is completely out of nowhere but

812
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,070
it's like that hero kind of fucking

813
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,659
barbarian fucking axe hammer thing it's

814
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,159
fucking awesome and he makes it himself

815
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,770
and I'm like oh I love this so much

816
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,540
where you know he's like suiting up for

817
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,280
battle but instead he's like be a

818
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,830
blacksmith making this thing shoves it

819
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,480
through a guy's mouth

820
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,149
really brutally throws it hits the

821
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,580
creepy fucking guy washing his car just

822
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,679
blood everywhere there's a chainsaw

823
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,929
fucking battle in the quarry

824
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,030
most of all like between that he spares

825
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,250
one of the victim girls yeah yeah he

826
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,540
lets he lets her go because she's been

827
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,920
and I was wondering if she was gonna

828
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,570
make it out at the end and then I think

829
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,920
the film does a good job of like

830
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,589
focusing on everybody anybody that was

831
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:07,770
enjoying the killing and revelry and a

832
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,640
fucked up

833
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,950
she was real quiet and kind of would cry

834
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,589
or kind of went out of a sad face on so

835
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,270
I guess he noticed that and let her go

836
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,880
if it was me I probably would have liked

837
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,099
him gild her anyway because hey she

838
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,470
didn't stop things you know but you see

839
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,690
the film has restraint in certain areas

840
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,000
so it does subvert expectations every

841
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
once in a while at least in in my

842
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,740
opinion what else

843
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,140
old lady tries to offer him sexual

844
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,990
pleasures

845
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,090
sort of she puts it in the most unique

846
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,530
way possible as like damn that is uh

847
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,140
that might give anybody's pause nope

848
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,350
no her fall with her head you it makes

849
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,410
you think oh I know everybody knew he's

850
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,240
gonna do throw her head in there and

851
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,060
then and then the you know I want it I

852
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,250
don't know I was just so geared up for

853
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,010
this final battle that I wanted it to be

854
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,900
a fucking battle but it's not about oh

855

858
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:11,050
satisfying as he crushes his fucking

859
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,730

860

possible but hey he's your own on your
