2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,749
reading this is where we snuff out the

3
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,669
resistance once and for all how do all

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,019
the makeup people keep forgetting to put

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,940
on his twirl mustache incinerate that

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,510
base destroy their transports and

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,160
obliterate their fleet well just say

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,050
kill everything resistant ship

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,060
approaching guns and shields in attack

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,500
mode but despite the fact that we're

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,150
here to destroy all rebel scum here

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,860
today we will talk to the pilot of this

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,270
puny ship because it will be an amusing

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,070
situation also the first order gets

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,749
distracted by this one pilot and decides

16
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,190
not to go ahead and blow away the rebel

17
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,989
base because inside every Empire first

18
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,149
order bad guy is a capacity for love you

19
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,920
gotta take that last cannon our bombers

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,460
are toast

21
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,440
seriously one beam cannon is gonna be

22
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,760
the difference here these guys barely

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,839
hit anybody when they have all the

24
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,359
cannons magic bb-8 magic quickly

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,859
devolves into an electric version of the

26
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,420
boy plugging the wall from that one

27
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:04,800
ancient fable I forgotten the name up

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,970
this morning McFly maneuver somehow

29
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,420
works

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,460
bring the bombs resistance bombers

31
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,530
approaching but why is every member of

32
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,270
this rebel fleet a Poe Dameron ignoring

33
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,010
general Leia's orders this battle sure

34
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,510
does go to ship awfully fast

35
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,310
like so fast they should never even have

36
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,230
attempted it I mean it ultimately ends

37
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,270
with one bomber left to drop bombs they

38
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,560
knew there would be fighters they acted

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,090
earlier like Poe taking out the cannons

40
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,770
would make this easy instead it's more

41
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,630
lopsided than Super Bowl 24 this

42
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,220
swarming force of first order pilots

43
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,450
were able to knock out these three

44
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,010
bomber ships without much problem but

45
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,390
now that there's one left they suddenly

46
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,500
get preoccupied with something

47
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,700
off-screen that prevents them from

48
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,500
ending this this remote falls completely

49
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,240
past her before she even moves her arm

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
but because this scene is in slow-mo

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,810
this real-life action must also be

52
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,400
slow-mo as she's able to catch it well

53
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,870
beyond the point of no return there's no

54
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,670
gravity and spent hold on I know I've

55
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,170
screwed this up before so let's try this

56
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:50,590
again

57
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,300
there is no force that would cause these

58
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,250
bombs to simply fall straight down onto

59
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,750
the Dreadnought like how gravity works

60
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,520
on earth as we see this once proud red

61
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,320
not explode and a cascade of flames I'm

62
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,490
wondering why are all the other

63
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,200
first-order ships useless here they

64
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,880
could fly after the rubble fleet - right

65
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,200
why did they put all their eggs in the

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,930
dread basket they can't get away soup

67
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,540
we have them tied on the end of a string

68
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,310
why wouldn't Snoke know that already

69
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,980
Doug wait you mean Luke didn't just

70
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,600
stare at Rey and a lightsaber for 25

71
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,680
minutes like he did at the end of the

72
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,960
force awakens she took a tiny step

73
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,370
backwards after handing it to him but it

74
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,720
must have been a four-step because now

75
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,460
she's a dozen feet away this moment

76
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,110
completely undermines the ending of the

77
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,460
force awakens and does so for a

78
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,530
throwaway joke yes Luke has given up on

79
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,640
the force at this point but you don't

80
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,230
need this gag to sell it you can hand it

81
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,550
back to her solemnly and accomplish the

82
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,170
same thing story-wise but you wanted to

83
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,120
subvert audience expectations a disease

84
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,330
that infects this entire film actually

85
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,610
discount Ewoks go away look if you want

86
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,080
Luke to be disillusioned and turned away

87
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,970
from the force fine but Rey just told

88
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,470
him his goddamn sister center and they

89
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,700
need his help he's not I'm gonna ask

90
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,980
about the details just by a man I have

91
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,420
angst over here do you think that I came

92
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,459
to the most unfindable place in the

93
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,950
galaxy for no reason at all no but I do

94
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,870
wonder why you left a map to this

95
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,310
unfindable place if you didn't want to

96
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,350
be found

97
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,840
[Music]

98
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,790
boobie balls unpasteurized ale a siren

99
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,590
milk but was there any reason he needed

100
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,820
a pole vault to the other side of the

101
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,530
lagoon the bottom pointy end of that

102
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,090
stick is in the same place when he's on

103
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,620
the original cliff as it is after he's

104
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,390
vaulted he just lifts it slightly and

105
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,950
slams it down onto a fish there's no

106
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,970
reason he could have done that at the

107
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,860
start and skip the Jedi Decathlon they

108
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,930
sent me here with hope but not Empire

109
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,180
Jedi jeez just imagine going on a trip

110
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,920
with only a new hope and mr. Magorium's

111
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,480
wonder Emporium then would he know

112
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,190
something that mission a slap a suppose

113
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,230
a demotion and a couple verbal burns

114
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,580
I honestly think Leia is being way too

115
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,680
easy on Poe here he literally caused the

116
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,510
death of like half the fleet that found

117
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,350
us this comes seconds after Leia showed

118
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,000
off her fancy homing beacon Apple watch

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,070
seconds also this should be the biggest

120
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,110
duh moment for Poe here right they are

121
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,580
obviously tracking you even if the

122
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,750
tracking through Lightspeed thing is

123
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,220
supposed to be impossible can we jump to

124
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,620
Lightspeed

125
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,680
one job fuel is this the first mention

126
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,360
of the concept of fuel and Star Wars I

127
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,280
sure don't remember Han in the original

128
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
trilogy ever having to worry about fuel

129
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,129
certainly not for jumps to Lightspeed

130
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,110
and Rey just took the Falcon supposedly

131
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,340
halfway around the universe looking for

132
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,110
Luke but this ship only has enough fuel

133
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,329
for one more jump Jesus because Snoke

134
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,950
ship and evil fleet all come out of

135
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,269
hyperspace here instead of over there

136
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,829
this entire movie is allowed to take

137
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,359
place ships in this universe only have

138
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,400
two speeds faster than fucking light and

139
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,070
impulse power

140
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,449
unnecessary spinning yes only poe and

141
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,400
bb-8 survive that hangar explosion what

142
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
a lucky narrative break this explosion

143
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
doesn't kill land nor does getting

144
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,740
sucked out into space what is the point

145
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,710
of all this if we can't blow up three

146
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,199
tiny cruisers Hux would be excellent at

147
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,789
cinema since they're faster and lighter

148
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:39,449
sir

149
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,460
they can't losses but they can keep it

150
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,840
arranged where our cannons are

151
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,810
ineffective against their shields

152
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,070
infuriating writing right here suddenly

153
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,990
and for the first time in all Star Wars

154
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,370
ships struggle to catch up to other

155
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,530
ships depend on fuel have limited jumps

156
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,389
to Lightspeed have impulse speed based

157
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:56,370
in part on their weight also we can have

158
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,870
some kind of near but far ballet of

159
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,880
characters they won't last long banning

160
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,860
fuel like this god dammit I have

161
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,180
pinpoint at the moment I gave up on

162
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,740
modern Star Wars movies and it was the

163
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,470
fuel it was the fuel it takes into the

164
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,970
last Jedi for these movies to actually

165
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,289
show Leia doing something with the force

166
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,150
other than telepathic communication also

167
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,590
I truly don't care if you want to

168
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,419
introduce new force powers but a little

169
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,770
explanation goes a long way especially

170
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,810
when said new power is literal space

171
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,430
resurrection isn't she unkillable now

172
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,110
where's that danger or does she only

173
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,340
have enough fuel for warm space

174
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,810
resurrection it's cute when the Borges

175
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,190
give Chewie grief as he's about to eat

176
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,300
their friend but where were these

177
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,620
assholes back when Julie was killing

178
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,030
their friend or plucking their friend

179
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,669
that's Admiral hold on battle of Chiron

180
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,590
Belt Admiral hold on dude how do you not

181
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,030
know what such a famous person looks

182
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,010
like Star Wars is weird it's like a long

183
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,960
time ago in a galaxy far away but they

184
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,310
have super advanced space travel and

185
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,110
weapons technology yet no one's invented

186
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,150
to photograph Captain Commander

187
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,949
you can call me whatever you like I just

188
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,240
want to know what's going on of course

189
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,979
you do so begins the completely

190
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,780
unnecessary and runtime bloating let's

191
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,400
not tell Poe what's going on so it in

192
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,199
Andros can go on a side quest that adds

193
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,610
an extra thirty minutes to this movie

194
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,349
plot point what are you doing here

195
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,630
hello everyone meet rose Rose is an

196
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,190
escape pod guard it's as if you can't

197
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,750
just lock up the escape pod bay and

198
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,490
require high-level access key cards to

199
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,469
get in also she's the last line of

200
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,000
defense here she's lucky a whole bunch

201
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,300
of does

202
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,159
don't come down here overpower her and

203
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,840
just launch multiple escape pods off the

204
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,229
ship

205
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,030
holy she stunned him without even giving

206
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,919
him one second to explain after just

207
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,909
fangirling over him

208
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,590
she has no chill we destroy her and

209
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,180
disable the tracker without them

210
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,009
realizing hey won't you realize it's off

211
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,199
for one system cycle about six minutes

212
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,479
what what's a system cycle - you can

213
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,340
turn off a main bridge class a system

214
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,870
but no one notices until the computer

215
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,970
does what the sweep of the ship for any

216
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,220
changes to processes and the ship is so

217
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,349
huge it takes six minutes hell this

218
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:38,400
movie knows where it wants all its

219
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,629
characters to be at certain times but

220
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,400
gives zero it's about how and why they

221
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,870
get there wait they're having the secret

222
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,310
against orders mission debrief in

223
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,039
general Leia's hospital rule the hey and

224
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,539
a spot where no one will pay us any mind

225
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:55,969
follow me I hate you could I do it of

226
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,830
course I could do it but I can't do it

227
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,960
yeah sure I make this easy right real

228
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,280
life doesn't have easy answers but a

229
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,139
nice simple plan using mass is exactly

230
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,580
what this movie needed and instead the

231
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,169
plot will divert to a whole other planet

232
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,550
and make this movie just as long as

233
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:15,300
transformers the last night lady neither

234
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,590
you nor they have the time for this kind

235
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,360
of flowery adjective filled exposition

236
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,750
you'll find him ruling a high-stakes

237
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,550
table fight he plays there 24 hours a

238
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,259
day they let him bang chicks and sleep

239
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,729
right there believe me there was never a

240
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,500
time that that guy isn't at that table

241
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,539
also what's his game can you at least

242
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:34,919
tell them what game he likes to play at

243
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,659
this high-stakes table I'm not doing

244
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,889
this yeah four would kill him

245
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,529
foreshadowing sorry that pun was pretty

246
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,539
forced oh I can't even force myself to

247
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,650
stop holy did we just stumble into the

248
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,389
Dark Crystal I was cleaning my blaster

249
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,370
it went off this is exactly the excuse I

250
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,779
would tell my ex-girlfriend whenever she

251
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,490
caught me masturbating oh those things

252
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,610
caretakers island natives they've kept

253
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,050
up the Jedi structure since they were

254
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,090
built do they live forever are their

255
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,409
male caretakers here or do they

256
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,569
reproduce with spores also this kind of

257
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,460
sounds like slavery like a powerful dude

258
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,349
getting his inherited cleaned and fixed

259
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,060
by the rag clothed natives of whatever

260
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,620
place his ancestor decided to build

261
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,879
their religious temple no one will be

262
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,259
seated during the climb up Kung Fu Panda

263
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,120
Mountain staircase

264
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,100
yeah but you made your exile camp on top

265
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,660
of a jedi temple that was built on top

266
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,420
of the dark so fleet only got 18 hours

267
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,440
of fuel left

268
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,060
we got a hurry how is there even enough

269
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,590
fuel for your little hyperspace journey

270
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,580
to space Vegas

271
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,290
he went from not eating these things to

272
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,430
allowing them to tear up the bridge of

273
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,230
the Falcon in about an hour you called

274
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,510
me a monster a monster

275
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,190
seriously the most compelling this movie

276
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,110
gets is these strange force time calls

277
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,760
between ray and Kyla but instead of

278
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,260
exploring that further it's just being

279
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,550
used as a reason to let them fight

280
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,080
together for one scene later and then be

281
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,190
enemies again what you're telling me

282
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,540
that the force can teleport matter now

283
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,400
public beach can't park that shuttle

284
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
here these motherf KERS honestly

285
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,130
couldn't find one place to park their

286
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,300
shuttle that wouldn't cause trouble for

287
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,010
them later also keep in mind that right

288
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,420
after they parked way down here on this

289
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,740
Beach they had to run to this casino

290
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,090
which is miles away

291
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,590
I understand these rich dicks wouldn't

292
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,670
allow them to park it right there at the

293
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,110
casino there had to be a better plan

294
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,970
than this Ma said this master code

295
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,170
breaker would have a red plum bloom on

296
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,610
his lapel because she knew he would

297
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,930
never change his jacket or shirt

298
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,520
gotta tell ya these discount horse

299
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
things just took me right out of the

300
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,580
movie right out of the universe of Star

301
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,230
Wars they are so out of place here I'm

302
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,270
expecting to see the USS Enterprise also

303
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,830
they're trying to find this master code

304
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,480
breaker a guy had a need to find fast

305
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,430
and risk parking their ship on a public

306
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,050
beach - fine but sure we have time for a

307
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,700
lesson about how terrible this town is I

308
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
wish I could put my fist through this

309
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,260
whole lousy beautiful town and film it

310
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,400
and upload it to pornhub Phoebe hey did

311
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,350
you guys not shoot any coverage why did

312
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,490
you just give me that close-up of her

313
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,990
staff mere centimeters from the rock

314
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,730
only to cut straight to a wide shot of

315
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,410
her and her staff several feet away from

316
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,680
the rock movie continues to go out of

317
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,970
its way to make these caretakers lives

318
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,950
miserable then medical frigate is out of

319
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,530
fuel and it shields it down gotta ask

320
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,570
since we just saw Finn and Rose flying

321
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,890
through hyperspace a minute ago in this

322
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,750
cruiser can the rebels not take fuel

323
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,460
from all the smaller ships and hook up

324
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,930
the medical frigate with it there's this

325
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,610
some Star Wars thing that only Star Wars

326
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,810
people know where everything uses

327
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,070
different kinds of fuel unless you got a

328
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,580
thief in your pocket our plan is shot

329
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,600
Finn and Rose just happened to get

330
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,980
thrown into the cell where the collector

331
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,260
is and yeah he knows how to do this they

332
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,510
need done why not I mean after all man

333
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,130
has told us only one person in the

334
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,540
universe could do it so stumbling on

335
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,560
another person shouldn't be too hard

336
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,480
it's amazing how far this movie went to

337
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,050
make up the

338
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,640
we drove this guy with this talent has

339
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,959
just been sitting here biding his time

340
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,580
until the right rescuer came along

341
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,200
there's a fucking sewer grate in the

342
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,580
middle of the prison walkway that's

343
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,180
right folks

344
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,040
not a jail set up with regular plumbing

345
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,510
or anything but an actual goddamn

346
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,220
escaped sewer also could these assholes

347
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,779
not be bothered to replace the grate on

348
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,519
either side of their escape route maybe

349
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,019
make it somewhat hard to find out where

350
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:52,810
you went I am decidedly not enjoying

351
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,600
this

352
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,399
so these giant horse goat things just

353
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,470
run headfirst through walls I guess they

354
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,610
know they'll be able to bust through and

355
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,230
won't slam at a steel or concrete

356
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,700
he thinks she's controlling the scooping

357
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,440
weight is the movie saying she is

358
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,029
controlling it heroes nearly fall off a

359
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,320
cliff and slide right to the edge of

360
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,540
their deaths cliche how the DJ get a

361
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,430
ship and find them the smother fear is a

362
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,000
luck dragon tell Falkor I said hello

363
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,240
left

364
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,860
I guess Disney is on a quest to cast

365
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,540
Benicio del Toro and as many of their

366
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,339
franchises as possible the rules that

367
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,839
seem more important at first than they

368
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,170
really are

369
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,050
but the pastime kill it if you have to I

370
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,279
see only way to become what you were

371
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,990
meant to be and that my friends was the

372
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,399
mantra recited during the writing of the

373
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,959
script and direct relation to the Star

374
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,490
Wars franchise you gotta admire the

375
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,110
balls on this movie I almost want to

376
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,850
remove sins for it being so ballsy but

377
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,899
you know how we do Brian Johnson and

378
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,670
Star Wars troll you can now roll the

379
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,360
footage from a few good men here you

380
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,450
can't handle the truth

381
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,579
finances so did I but hey at least you

382
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,700
found some mirrors if I go to him then

383
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,950
solo will time she seems super sure

384
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,510
about this after spending basically the

385
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,800
entire movie whining about how she

386
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,029
doesn't know anything about the force

387
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,399
and what's going on inside Yoda ghost

388
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,410
Yoda waited a long mother time to make

389
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,420
another appearance also Yoda looks like

390
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,160
an actor who actually died in real life

391
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,959
and then they found archived footage to

392
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,490
put him into this movie if ghost Jedi

393
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,140
can do this then they should have been a

394
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,459
lot more helpful in the last two

395
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,589
trilogies but that library contained

396
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,810
nothing that the girl Rey just not

397
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,510
already grammatically this is a clever

398
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,740
way of disguising whether or not the

399
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,360
library itself and the text they're in

400
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,220
wherever actually important for parsecs

401
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,260
to go this thing really clicks I guess

402
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,000
aren't you going at Lightspeed isn't

403
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,560
that the same for all ships it's just

404
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,480
that main Cruiser now and that fuel

405
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,490
reserve our experts say it's at maximum

406
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,670
storytelling level sir

407
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,330
that we have a plan that there's hope

408
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,279
I swear too fuzzy Zeus on a cracker if

409
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,930
one more person says hope I'm going to

410
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,090
lose my Star Wars movies are hereby

411
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,010
forbidden from ever again using the word

412
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,870
hope if you could cast soccer player

413
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,000
Hope Solo in a movie you better change

414
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,680
her name in the credits I'm serious

415
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,570
polar on our way back to the fleet how

416
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,710
in the hell are they having this radio

417
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:08,490
conversation Wow in Lightspeed ruled so

418
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,850
far huh that's weird that one shield

419
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,200
just flipped I guess there's no reason

420
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,520
to radio down and have somebody check

421
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,880
that out storm troopers are doing what

422
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,529
you mean to tell me that Poe who proudly

423
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,570
gave Finn his name still refers to him

424
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,640
as a stormtrooper and doesn't she know

425
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,589
who the Finn is you have bet the

426
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,750
survival of the resistance on bad odds

427
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,700
and put us all at risk considering this

428
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,900
is her response to finding out about

429
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,180
Finn and Rosa's side mission um no he

430
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,980
didn't he created an entirely detach

431
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,600
mission for a couple folks that might

432
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,400
ultimately aid the resistances fight

433
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,810
while not attracting them from their

434
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,790
current battle even one bit mutiny

435
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,070
full-blown mutiny all because hole dough

436
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,839
didn't share her plan and Poe thinks

437
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,310
he's resistant to Jesus and they're all

438
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,650
wrong clear the bridge escort the

439
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,440
officers down to the hangar this movie

440
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,030
totally rips off Crimson Tide here in

441
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,290
the middle of third act that I'm pretty

442
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,580
sure it's just to stretch the runtime of

443
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,350
an already bloated movie that ones a

444
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,970
troublemaker I like him hate you oh you

445
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,170
do not

446
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,640
this guy has insulted you called you a

447
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,290
traitor disobeyed orders started a

448
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,760
mutiny and other than looking like Oscar

449
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,240
Isaac oh hold on ooh the first order was

450
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,830
tracking our big ship they're gonna

451
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,430
monitoring four little transports we

452
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,630
could slip down to the surface

453
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,600
unnoticed and high until the first order

454
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,880
passes yep and why couldn't hold Oh tell

455
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,350
him that again if there was fear of a

456
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,459
mole being on the ship that would have

457
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,750
made this whole surprise make sense

458
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,490
instead hold on made a known

459
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,320
troublemaker panic about the situation

460
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,700
and forced his hand to try something

461
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,959
else that might have messed up her plan

462
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,030
also all those plan relies on the first

463
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,100
order not tracking their transports fine

464
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,750
but this also suggests that they would

465
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,520
never suspect the rebels to board escape

466
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,930
pods once they got within firing range

467
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,730
that they just sit there during an

468
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,529
attack and die peacefully the first

469
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:47,910
order doesn't know of how skate pots

470
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,680
right it was a big plot point a new hope

471
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,240
they didn't help destroy the Empire also

472
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
also couldn't they also see you with

473
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,760
their eyeballs

474
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,899
you're not cloaked

475
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,220
you're a couple doesn't escape capsules

476
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,170
leaving a main shit they can see you

477
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,939
right why are they marching prisoners to

478
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:02,879
the main launching bed I see him turning

479
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,619
the lightsaber to strike true while this

480
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:08,970
turns into one of the movies signature

481
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,410
scenes I've got to wonder about the

482
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,910
nature of this action Snoke can

483
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,009
obviously sense kylos intentions so how

484
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,629
is he able to tell Snoke he intends to

485
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,309
kill ray while making a deliberate

486
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,929
action to kill him at the same time

487
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:25,050
without being found out awesome even

488
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,540
remove a sim worthy but was Snoke

489
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,800
we built this guy up throughout the

490
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,119
first movie and now we're killing him

491
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,139
near the end of the second one without

492
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,550
an ounce of explanation as to where he

493
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,199
came from by the way whatever happened

494
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,059
to the Knights of Ren didn't they exist

495
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,319
weren't they a thing in the force

496
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:39,149
awakens rather could they go this is the

497
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,980
way action should basically work minimal

498
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,389
cutting and a well choreographed fight

499
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:44,309
with no shaky cam or extreme close-ups

500
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,110
of random things I hope other directors

501
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:52,110
are watching this it only took us nine

502
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,429
minutes a movie time to figure that out

503
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:55,050
so why not drag out their deaths even

504
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,399
longer so that something might save them

505
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,470
also for fuck's sake can the movie make

506
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,449
one logical decision these two are not

507
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:02,279
major resistance figures phasma hates

508
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,660
him because of personal reasons but

509
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,800
these are not the kind of resistance

510
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,589
heroes you'd say this about holy oh what

511
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,120
a shocker Finn and Rose and all the

512
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,379
people important for the story are still

513
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,699
alive after Holden's Lightspeed

514
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,120
badassery captain phasma and this cadre

515
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,679
of stormtroopers still care about

516
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,449
killing Finn and rose after all that and

517
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,129
by the way wasn't fast negating the

518
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,779
order to kill them just before the whole

519
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,860
duel maneuver are you telling me that

520
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,420
after that she brushed herself off went

521
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,709
to another part of the ship rounded up

522
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:29,999
some stormtroopers then came back to

523
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,559
kill them Finn has been wasted this

524
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,999
whole movie so let's have him square off

525
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,589
at the end against phasma who has also

526
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:35,970
been wasted this whole movie really

527
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,649
someone needs to get snoke's legs an

528
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,240
agent because they have amazing dramatic

529
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,860
timing how long are these Thai fighters

530
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,209
been shooting at Snoke ship currently

531
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,860
being flown by Finn and ROS and can't

532
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,120
hit it until the last minute the first

533
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,949
order true to form lands binocular

534
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,809
distance away from the rebel base rather

535
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,009
than simply landing right next to the

536
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,299
giant metal wall that they are going to

537
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,920
spend the next 15 minutes slowly

538
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,269
approaching oh I guess the rebels didn't

539
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:58,920
care much about fire codes and when it

540
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,480
came to building this base it's a hefty

541
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,949
fine no wonder they didn't last long

542
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:04,169
here I can't send this enough how far

543
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,549
away these assholes landed from the base

544
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,049
the rebels have flown for quite some

545
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,819
time at this point in those first order

546
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,709
sir still ants on the horizon oh yeah

547
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,299
there's also a bunch of ice wolves on

548
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,559
this planet it's like the brainstorming

549
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,029
session where no suggestion is mocked

550
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,589
somehow became the actual writers room

551
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,019
King rose why the fuck did she do this

552
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,669
he's about to sacrifice himself to save

553
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,769
hundreds of people and she does this she

554
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:23,789
was gonna do something that was gonna

555
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,289
potentially end her own life why didn't

556
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:26,939
she just crash headfirst into the cannon

557
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,319
instead of preventing thing from doing

558
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,360
it now yeah everybody Rose I hope you're

559
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,190
happy that's how we're gonna win not

560
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,049
fighting what we can season what we love

561
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,059
also letting someone smash into a cannon

562
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,289
that would have saved hundreds of lives

563
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,029
would have worked ooh but sure what an

564
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:43,919
empowering message of stupidity King

565
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,700
Michael babe

566
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,950
stalling so we can escape it sure would

567
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,330
have been nice for Luke to tell them

568
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,919
that before he went out to confront Kyla

569
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,210
maybe even tell them where some exits

570
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,519
are hell maybe even help create an exit

571
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,500
since a fairly Jedi are like God now but

572
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,700
I guess having PO figure it out for

573
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,320
himself and figuring Rey would come to

574
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,549
save the day what's good enough when I

575
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,730
kill you I will have killed the last

576
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,259
roll credits surprisingly close to the

577
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,539
credits though well I guess we need to

578
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,159
read the big book of Jedi tricks that

579
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,600
have never been in one movie up until

580
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,370
now seventh edition to understand how

581
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,840
Luke is projecting himself light-years

582
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,470
away from this spot so the bracelet or

583
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,299
necklace or whatever that Luke gave Leia

584
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,279
was also a hologram even though it looks

585
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,110
and acts like a physical thing and I

586
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,399
have a number of questions about it but

587
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,200
Luke died like three minutes ago but I

588
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,909
guess this explains why we lose 21

589
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:31,679
Holograms when we die Master how the

590
