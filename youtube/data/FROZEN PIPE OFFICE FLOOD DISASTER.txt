1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
oh my god i came in i came in here

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,589
it was like it was like Niagara Falls

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
today is a holiday here in the states

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,820
it's not a real holiday called president's day just a stupid holiday

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,700
where nobody works and makes it really hard to get anything done

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,000
it may have holidays where people don't have to work during the week

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,480
why don't they have reverse holidays where everyone has to work on the

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,480
weekends if I were in charge

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:59,760
dear cannon

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,650
quick question what were you possibly thinking when you thought it was a good

11
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,920
idea to put this little button right here

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,820
let me explain this is the canon g7x widely regarded as the best . shoot for

13
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,470
blogging on the market

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,759
I agree that it's the best point and shoot for vlogging on the market but why

15
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,430
why does it have this stupid button right here

16
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,780
it's really a super huge big deal because when you use this camera you use

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,320
this flip monitor right here so you can see yourself so you walk like this

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,000
now when the monitors flipped up you can't hold him from the side there's no

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,490
way you can't hold it from the top

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,720
because the monitors in the way the only way to hold it is like this

21
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,640
your thumb lands there and your other finger lands right here directly over

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,500
this button finger button finger button finger button

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,210
i'm only like this i'm recording this happens to me all the time I

24
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,840
accidentally push the stupid button and what happens

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,479
it cancels my recording stops recording and asks me to enter a nickname for this

26
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,200
camera

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
who gives a camera nickname I give my dog a nickname

28
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:18,060
I don't need to interrupt your chute to give my camera a nickname now to simply

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,920
about a product that's just complaining i prefer to offer solutions because

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,000
that's constructed yeah

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:36,040
yeah

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,160
around me

33
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:58,819
there are value just going and there we go

34
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,599
the piece of the CD covers the button so no matter how much I squeeze it will

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,599
never activated again tape holds it in place

36
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,180
ok really snowing out right now

37
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,209
this is griffin you know I shot an awesome movie a little while ago

38
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:22,040
he's like a free 60 B are specialists and we shot a 360 movie wherein we buy

39
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,440
like illegal counterfeit purses

40
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,549
it's a pretty sensational video but we just sort of finished a lot of the busy

41
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,799
work on it so maybe i'll release it this week

42
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,720
this is the really really gnarly scene where like the dudes that were selling

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,010
the counter for purses just started screaming at it

44
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,110
these are the guys that were happy to see me

45
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,890
everybody good reason i know very very very crazy right now so I'm going to

47
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,480

57
