22

jontron

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,610
Hercules Greek myths have always been a

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,860
fascinating subject to me tales of

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
treacherous journeys and epic voyages

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,060
across the sea mythological beasts of

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,580
old and the very fabric of nature itself

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,920
they tell of humans creating

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,840
larger-than-life heroes and gods in

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,170
their own flawed image no one is safe

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,560
from his or her own hubris so to make an

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,850
example of my point I'm gonna play

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,400
Hercules game on a Commodore 64 it's

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,619
called Hercules what a name I guess they

35
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,210
didn't have to try back then it was all

36
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,470
I had to worry about was Ronald Reagan

37
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,270
talking about garbage job more like the

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,610
Commodore 64 I'm just kidding it was

39
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,160
actually revolutionary

40

[Music]

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,320
that's what I call music now you know me

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,400
and everybody's favorite part of

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,900
Hercules Smith was horse sheep lion barn

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,850
not sure what this is but if it's in if

45
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,690
it's in good

46
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,430
alright good thing we got some back

47
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,890
story here let's begin

48
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:37,250
[Music]

49
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,200
so yeah apparently you die instantly if

50
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,640
you don't start to move I'm not fucking

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,250
around I'm talking like instantly I mean

52
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,840
what kind of legendary reflexes that

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
they expect people to have I mean at

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,950
this point they barely mastered Galaga

55
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,020
as soon as your diet skips you ahead

56
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,790
randomly to the next level or something

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,140
so you don't even have a chance to learn

58
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,580
what you did wrong in the first place

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,950
and before you know it it's over what

60
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,380
the hell is this shit this was so

61
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,330
jarring to me that I had to actually go

62
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,950
online and check if that's the way the

63
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,510
game was supposed to be and it's not

64
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,420
just broken and yeah that's the way the

65
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,030
game is supposed to be who would do this

66
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,970
Oh what notice it's absolutely random

67
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,220
it's like the 1980s version if I want to

68
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,470
be the guy you jump here platform turns

69
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,180
a miserable fire then you jump there

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,490
fire hey at least I can get the Big

71
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:26,940
Sleep

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,950
so I don't have to play this game and

73
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,890
I'm not talking about the Salvador Dali

74
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,760
painting

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,700
oh yeah Herc climb those ropes climb

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,310
those ropes baby so close almost at the

77
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,360
exit so close come on come on I'm done

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,130
with this believe it or not there's

79
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,810
actually another Hercules related game

80
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,540
on the Commodore 64's called Hercules

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,070
Slayer of the Damned I guess they just

82
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,290
couldn't got enough of that generic

83
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,930
Indies mythos back in the day what with

84
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,209
the hot pink who ever heard of a game

85
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,880
being on a cassette tape I was born up

86
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:07,390
where's Ellen

87
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,260

well hi there what are you up to today

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,780

90
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,010
this one yes

91
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,479
you just sort of beat the shit out of

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,120
this guy and there's all these things

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,740
going on in the corners in the screen

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,440
that I just I just have no idea what the

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,570
hell there's actually other versions of

96
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,100
this game on consoles like the ZX

97
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:44,580
Spectrum of the MSX

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,979
haha is that the way you're gonna put no

99
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:50,290
thank you I'm not dancing this dance

100
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,449
today well should I say shuffling this

101
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,729
shuffle next as for some of the early

102
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,259
video game industry's more interesting

103
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:01,740
tanks on Hercules fable we have gifs JG

104
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,419
there's oldest lady oh it's a Famicom

105
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,669
RPG and quite honestly I could not tell

106
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,259
you what the hell is going on in this

107
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,120
rather unknown series is still going on

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,130
today I'm a Nintendo DS under the same

109
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,699
name

110
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,740
what a fat so here's a little-known

111
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,590
classic the ps1 hurts adventures that's

112
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,699
all faced up the military-industrial

113
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,830
complex truth be told I don't even know

114
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,949
where I'm getting all these games from

115
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,820
now if we're being strict on

116
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,590
mythological canon here this is actually

117
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,080
Hercules as you can see here he is the

118
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,100
Hercules of legend

119
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,490
just call him hurt it counts you can

120
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,020
also pick four mythological characters

121
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,720
Atlanta and Jason if you stupid I don't

122
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,259
know why play ds2 wasn't city in Georgia

123
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,139
the other ones a regular name man I want

124
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,389
to play as Hercules that sounds just a

125
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,940
bit too much like dan Castellaneta so

126
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,530
it's basically just a Diablo style beat

127
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,690
em up it's pretty cool honestly one of

128
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,039
the better lesser known games out there

129
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,770
for the ps1 the art style sweet and the

130
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,199
music sounds a near lawsuit level of

131
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,020
similar to the Star Wars

132
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:17,090

133
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,150

good work so far but you still have a

135
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,150
long way to go seek out the help my

136
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:37,949
fellow Hades has many allies in fact

137

138
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,430

139
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,219

144
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:13,920
speak up a bit

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,110

familiar face and hey this movie's

154
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,470
always been one of my favorites so let's

155
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,790
see what this one has to offer

156

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,740
house when I'm sleeping man this game is

158

DeVito that talks to you yes right at

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,010
all I wouldn't think the game functions

163
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,080
on a 2-d played and largely consists of

164
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,850
sprites it's all very interesting and

165
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,430
exciting and just dang fun to play I'd

166
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,780
have to say it could easily be

167
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,849
considered a hidden gem on the ps1 I

168
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,800
mean come on just listen to Danny

169
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,099
DeVito's conviction it's a thing of

170
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,890
beauty okay yeah that guy he had a truth

171
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,930
in that dialogue we're all living the

172
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,030
human condition but he's speaking it I

173
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,920
mean after something like this it

174
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,660
couldn't get any better right it stops

175
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,060
we've had fun we're at ecstasy wrong

176
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,370
gameplay versus a piece of shit have a

177
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,780
look for yourself I'm sure there would

178
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,410
be an enriching experience

179
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:10,829
[Music]

180
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,389
now listen to me if everybody was

181
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,920
critical about everything all the time

182
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
the world of the adult place so let's

183
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,309
start with the positives at least it

184
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:18,839
gave me a miliseconds preview of the

185
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,339
game before shott gonna hit my fucking

186
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:20,879
face

187
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,369
Hercules look for bonuses in the trees

188
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:26,579
what does that mean dude mmm if there

189
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:27,660
were anything to give me the goose

190
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,179
pimples it's probably that that's just

191
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,649
weird that's like starting to game off

192
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,660
being like Hercules remember the scent

193
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,319
of mother receptive don't start me off

194
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,660
like that ease me into this shit okay

195
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,179
don't just start off gung-ho don't play

196
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,749
a Royal Flush right away I always save a

197
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,069
royal flush when playing poker

198
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:49,710
the thing is don't play poker with me

199
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,770
[Music]

200
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,690
got that music that sounds nothing like

201
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,490
Disney's Hercules that doesn't even

202
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,960
sound like it could go in the special

203
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,820
features on the DVD it's just one of

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,240
those songs that drones on and on and on

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
perfectly complementing the gameplay I

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
might add these hints just keep popping

207
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:07,960
up

208
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,780
Hercules beware of fire balls Hercules

209
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,240
beware of spite and jealousy this game

210
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,280
is pure action I'm time this game is so

211
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,020
much action that if there was a water

212
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,580
protest this game would be there at

213
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,140
Times Square picketing before the

214
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,910
feminists got there that looks more like

215
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,220
Luke Skywalker than Disney's fucking

216
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,800
Hercules he does some weird run if you

217
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,480
mess around with the buttons I don't

218
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,250
know what it does though this game is an

219
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,220
ungodly amount of hard-won fuckup and

220
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,050
you're dead and back to the beginning

221
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,480
lovely I mean come on how do I get on

222
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,600
this vine I'm inching so slowly and I

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,750
can't I can't get it oh I see you got to

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,910
do this bullshit they get it of course

225
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,280
good luck Landing that this game is

226
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,780
clearly meant to be an acrobatic

227
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,850
platformer as you can see well while

228
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,810
we're here we might as well rave about

229
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,160
it

230
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,959
I have to say though it's kind of cool

231
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,819
when he swings his sword feels like

232
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,560
there's some real weight to it now that

233
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,089
would be all there is to say about the

234
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,829
Disney Hercules games but there's one

235
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,569
last strange addition to this collection

236
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,360
Hercules - for the Sega Genesis

237
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,089
okay that's right there's a pirated

238
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,250
version of the ps1 edition for the Sega

239
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,410
Genesis Hercules - that sure makes a lot

240
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,000
of sense

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,430
[Music]

242
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,350
where was Hercules won exactly someone

243
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,730
fill me in on this so what's with the

244
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,740
snapping did you mean to use this sound

245
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,139
effect guys this game is really odd it

246
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,850
uses a lot of the same sound bite it's

247
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:52,310
just incredibly bit crusher

248
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,350
Hercules does what Nintendo Keeley's Oh

249
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,000
lists Hercules The Legendary Journeys

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,569
you know like the TV show with Arnold

251
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:06,050
Schwarzenegger whoever the fuck that was

252
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,759
javi Oh Albert Pacino Fonzie the fact

253
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,870
that there's a game of this pretty much

254
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,720
verifies that someone out there hates me

255
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,150
Hercules TV edition

256
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,430
yeah this menu music makes me feel like

257
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm about to embark on an educational

258
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,970
adventure or something I'm not knocking

259
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,520
that because I want to do that so I hope

260
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,380
that's what's going to happen the broom

261
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,650
is made up of billions and billions of

262
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,260
new Romans stay while friend and I will

263
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,779
tell you an epic tale yes who I'm buying

264
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,910
it I mean clearly that is the gates of a

265
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,710
man who has an epic tale to tell

266
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,290
bla bla bla bla gives that probably some

267
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,029
about Dracula werewolves why should do

268
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:47,990
the super sketch

269
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,880
good morning can ease it it's time to

270
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,460
Train follow me outside so that we may

271
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,800
begin I feel like I I don't feel like

272
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,930
I'm being treated appropriately hmm

273
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,550
something about this game that's just

274
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,279
eerily familiar isn't it but I can't put

275
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,360
my finger on it

276
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,240
hmm what is it the blue action button

277
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,140
the chicken cooing that forest-like and

278
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,240
cosy oh but in that telly shit teleport

279
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,040
centaur should have called it the legend

280
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,900
of Hercules ocarina of time if it gets

281
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,730
my cold

282
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,960
seriously this game's introduction is

283
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,510
nearly identical to Ocarina of Time it's

284
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,070
like they just want to get my Pavlovian

285
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,300
going my Pavlov am sold I need you to

286
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,250
clear these rocks out of this field for

287
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,089
me Hercules I mean honestly you get the

288
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,220
deadliest and strongest demigod on the

289
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,810
planet and this is what you use

290
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,060
important this is his best application

291
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,620
well I mean yeah well us can pick up

292
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,600
rocks that big your sister should I

293
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
can't do it you know as far as a

294
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,990
licensed game with an IP this mundane

295
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,580
it's really not that bad kind of

296
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,350
impressive in scale although ultimately

297
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,160
it's nothing I'd write home about

298
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,939
but let's be honest

299
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,559
bring down the mic best thing about this

300
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,299
game is the over power to ask pause

301
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,739
sound actually there's also a gameboy

302
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:07,799
version of this one have a look at it

303
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:25,600
that's so the first thing you'll notice

304
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,669
about this magnificent work of art is

305
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,040
the score or should I say the knife is

306
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,189
running up and down rusty garbage bins

307
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:35,439
that's probably closer this hurts my

308
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,839
ears so bad it needs to stop it's like a

309
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,759
mix between a fever dream in the Insane

310
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,850
Clown Posse oh man looks like art

311
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,660
Keeley's is great one too many Ambrosius

312
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,749
yeah his walk cycle is amazing I can't

313
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:51,609
get enough of it he looks like Eric

314
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:56,049
Cartman trying to cut a jade unlike the

315
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,149
n64 version this one's more like an RPG

316
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:01,179
it makes this annoying sound every time

317
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:06,010
you talk to someone

318
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,390
like the world is coming to an end or

319
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,140
something I only speak to sailors well

320
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,400
if that's the case you're probably gonna

321
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,990
be pretty much limiting yourself to port

322
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,610
towns honestly and even then they'd have

323
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,440
to see most of the time why don't you

324
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,850
want a boat a boat would really be a

325
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,070
better fit for you also what the fuck

326
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,410
who says that the fishermen also only

327
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,210
talks to sailors they're here well let

328
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,680
me at least that one makes some sense

329
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,650
the stroller also only talks to sailors

330
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,660
okay first of all what kind of an

331
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,970
occupation is stroller what kind of town

332
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,520
is this anyone even learned speech if

333
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,900
everyone talks to sailors and there

334
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,940
ain't no sailors around town well I

335
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,830
guess if being a sailor is what it takes

336
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,720
to be validated around here I might as

337
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,310
well take to the streets and give it my

338
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,900
all

339
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:55,029
[Music]

340
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,620
he didn't stand a chance

341
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,019
poor hunk of a bastard sunk like a break

342
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,360
man well this sweet old lady looks kind

343
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,220
enough maybe I'll finally get a hint

344
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,470
about what to do around here don't stay

345
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,620

346
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,570

347
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,430
imposed on you madam good thing we're

348
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,320

349
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,940
turned ugly leaves me alone

350
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,940
can't you see that I am busy oh don't

351
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,920
you worry Yuri it's plain for all to see

352
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,810
also I think it's prudent to point out

353
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,579
that it's actually mr. Uranus who's the

354
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,740
busy one busy busy busy

355
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,540
you can't even be bothered to clean up

356
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,480
that cat he's so preoccupied cat snip

357
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,860
dude you can't just leave something like

358
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,600
this hanging around guys step up gotta

359
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,250
be a man get rid of this put in the

360
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,890
trash can't be shirking responsibility

361
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,570
now I've played a lot of RPGs in my day

362
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,820
and I gotta say hands down this one has

363
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,240
to have the most standoffish NPCs ever I

364
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,370
don't think even one of these people is

365
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,680
happy to see you might as well not be

366
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,959
there at all hey guys I don't think you

367
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,990
should be so rude to Hercules he's just

368
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,149
son of Zeus also we can kill you really

369
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,440
easily I think that's the main thing

370
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,510
all right well if I can't find any help

371
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,080
outside maybe I'll find some help inside

372
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,380
get out of our home

373
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,240
well yeah I mean I I suppose that's

374
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,340
right I think everything from that would

375
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:27,940
be deviating from the norm and actually

376
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,500
watching people going out of the white

377
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,990
