1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,069
[Laughter]

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,050
he doesn't even know it's gone hey both

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,269
of you guys so on Julian's vlog Channel

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,610
last week as many of you guys saw we did

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,380
have a little bit of an accident permit

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,539
was chasing a squirrel and skidded on

7
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,880
the deck park next to our pool and did

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
fall into the pool it was so not funny

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,900
at the time

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,730
Julian saved him he was swimming he

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,289
knows how to swim a little bit it's very

12
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,169
funny now but after that everyone was

13
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,669
like you should try and teach them how

14
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,320
to swim they know how to swim like out

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,880
of survival but I guess I've never

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,859
actually tried to teach them how to swim

17
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,840
because they don't really enjoy the

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,300
water they have shown no interest in

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,129
wanting to go in like if you're floating

20
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,989
on a raft like they'll sit with you they

21
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,820
enjoy that but in terms of swimming

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,739
they're not really water dogs I would

23
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,539
love to be able to teach them how to

24
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,030
swim to like that shelf in there the

25
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,100
stairs like just out of pure survival

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,480
because I think it's a worthy endeavor

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,670
to just try and if theirs were to

28
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,350
actually happen it would probably take a

29
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,019
very long time to teach them but there's

30
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:05,050
no better time is then now I've looked

31
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,490
up a couple of different types of

32
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,170
youtube videos about people trying to

33
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,820
teach dogs to swim and it all for the

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,620
most part just looks a little bit of a

35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,870
mess you get them in there you try and

36
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,940
teach them to swim you see how the dog

37
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,340
responds I'm going to do my very best to

38
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,430
make sure that they're safe that they're

39
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,500
not too stressed out they're also like

40
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,630
my dog so think I can read them pretty

41
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,860
well and I'm not gonna do anything

42
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,090
that's gonna stress them out too much

43
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,860
but like I said they don't really have

44
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,630
any interest in going in the pool so

45
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,610
they're not puppies it's gonna be a

46
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,350
little difficult to get them to decide

47
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,880
that they want to go in the pool so I'm

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,500
hoping that we can teach them if they

49
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,570
ever fell in the pool how they can get

50
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,850
out which is mostly my concern like they

51
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,290
don't have to be crazy about going

52
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,240
swimming to me I just would like it if

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,610
maybe they knew how to save themselves

54
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,870
karmak did everything right though he

55
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,460
kept his head above the water he was

56
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:51,790
just

57
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,080
there but lake we're always watching

58
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,670
them when we're outside I'm not like

59
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,380
genuinely fearful that they're gonna

60
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,700
fall in pool and we also have like a

61
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,440
cool alarm too that we can put in there

62
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,030
we have one of those we just haven't

63
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,980
installed it yet but I'd say let's try

64
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,530
let's see how they do and unlike all the

65
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,670
other times that they have gone swimming

66
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,780
with me in the past

67
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,729
I don't got them some lifejacket you

68
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,140
know I feel like that's a good way to

69
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,030
train them cuz I have seen dog videos

70
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,170
where the people trained them with

71
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,570
lifejacket so we'll try so this is what

72
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,090
these lifejackets look like I say we put

73
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,370
them on take them outside I'll go in the

74
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,710
pool have some treats see if we can get

75
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,750
them interested the only one I think

76
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,850
that would go for that and their wildest

77
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,310
dreams is the food driven one miss wheet

78
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,260
do you want to try this on to me it's

79
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,420
for full safety and if y'all are asking

80
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,650
if I'm really gonna wear all these

81
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,330
clothes in the pool the answer is yes

82
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,250
because most of y'all are cool but some

83
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,410
of y'all are body Shamus I don't feel

84
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,860
like hearing it today you're gonna go

85
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:52,140
swimming - don't worry

86
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,690

87
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,050
I feel good so Bobby I think yours isn't

88
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,900
it like gonna be kind of big bud yes

89
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
like but you're gonna look like a tiny

90
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,470
little turtle I don't know it's not

91
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,299
really about marble he's the least of my

92
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,239
concerns you know it's the other to be

93
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:37,340
out of control can she walk in it

94
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,680
we can get any of them interested in

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:51,880
coming into the water

96
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,560
[Music]

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,270
I'm really sorry for the noise we will

98
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,440
be cutting lawns

sitting in the water

this is honestly farther than I've ever

102
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,340

okay books mean it's a good boy

111
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,000
you did it I know I scared even me

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,090
especially after you fell in love

113
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,479
we was marble

114
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,150
marble we're doing swing loss in mirror

I

118
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:36,030
oh this is probably gonna be the hardest

119
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,620
part it's just getting them like

120
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:57,390
comfortable I mean up for P girl

121
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,550
hop up

122

123
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:14,050
would be this good

124
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:29,120
you can't skip swim lesson dude that's

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:41,440
my necklace that I care deeply about I

126
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,120
know it's hard to learn how to swim I

127
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,180
had to do it to Beach promise retreats

128
00:06:47,180 --> 00:07:06,720
fast

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
he will do anything to not get it I will

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,690
say he is extra handsome in that length

131
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,520
jacket I think I'm gonna take him over

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,250
there I'm gonna just show him like these

133
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:26,660

134
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:36,210
good boy

135
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:49,759
this is the spot of the foul right here

136
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm like so proud and amazed like why

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,839
haven't we done this sooner like makes

138
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,029

139
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,080

140
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:13,510
hi bud look at him look excited

141
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:19,150
[Music]

142
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,540
yes

143
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,060
this is where it ends okay you can't

144
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,740
jump off here or than you're swimming

145
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,310
but oh you want to swim

146
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,540
good yeah they're doing so much better

147
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,760
than I ever thought we've already gotten

148
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,220
them to like this part and where they

149
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,930
can pull themselves out jumping in the

150
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,250
pool is a little scary and I don't blame

151
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,570
them because that's like where the fear

152
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,430
comes in but getting out of the pool and

153
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,140
like navigating the shallow spaces

154
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:57,760
they're getting really good at so why we

155
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:35,710
never done it just fun come on

156
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:43,120
job but good boy about such a good boy

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,090
Kermie it's like all it took was for us

158
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,500
to work with him for a little bit and

159
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,030
you would have swum straight to the

160
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,120
shelf teaches like something else

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:17,620
she's so after they get really

162
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,570
comfortable with us take their life

163
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,030
vests off you know like the amount that

164
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,740
they've gotten comfortable with being in

165
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,320
the water is like zero to a hundred like

166
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,050
I thought today it was just gonna be a

167
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,920
bunch of fear and they're so good and

168
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,570
they're Italian Greyhounds like I don't

169
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,370
know kind of dog you have but like the

170
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,970
probably will market box speaking of

171
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,290
intelligent animals so I don't think

172
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,590
that Bobby is gonna ever willingly jump

173
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,530
into the pool no and I I'm like kind of

174
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:54,820
cool like I'm cool with marbles like

175
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,190
never wanting to jump in the water like

176
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,770
he's way too chilled out for that what I

177
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,510
would like is for him to just get some

178
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,150
practice with

179
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,850
yeah I don't like that I'm completely

180
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,690
happy with that do you want to treat

181
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,800
absolutely nothing Bobby if you ever

182
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,120
fell in the pool and you got to here

183
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,220
that's all I could ask for he has jumped

184
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,700
out

185
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,000
he just can't with this big this yeah

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:28,839
that's Bobby's assignment look at that

187
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:38,020
little rudder it's okay it's helping you

188
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:50,080
floatin like in a hundred round are we

189
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,020
pulling the lifejacket is helping him

190
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,630
float so much he weighs them try it

191
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,710
again I was amazing

192
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:04,360
he's a little rough I'm it

193
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,710
this is too big I'll take this off you

194
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,150
in a little bit and you can try jumping

195
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,370
down okay right now I just want you to

196
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,020
practice your little swims with your

197
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:36,770
best okay easily the best sir easily the

198
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,930
best are you silent

199
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,810
so fast he's a senior dog like this is

200
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,780
really good exercise yeah and is keeping

201
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,550
you nice and cool if you would accept

202
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,530
the treat ever like maybe it would be a

203
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,140
rewarding experience for you this is all

204
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,510
you want the hi this wonderful what the

205
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,640
hell dude when I'm hanging out on the

206
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,230
raft he'll just sit there with me like

207
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,360
this like he does really like it I think

208
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,070
they're all just like generally scared

209
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,170
of dipping their face under which is

210
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,730
like when you teach babies how to swim

211
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,260
that's like the scariest part really

212
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,040
putting your head under so my goodness

213
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,630
you've been a good time what

214
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,500
[Music]

215
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:33,540
Oh God he's so impressive Oh goodbye

216
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,160
Kermit I know a lot of times their first

217
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,860
instinct is to swim to the wall so if I

218
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,570
could just get him to keep swimming this

219
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,510
way and jump out like that's all I could

220
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,910
ask for marbles like he doesn't need to

221
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,840
enjoy swimming

222
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,510
he's a five-pound Chihuahua actually

223
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,480
changed my main do not really want to

224
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,500
get out actually feels very many

225
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,380
survival skills bud you know what if for

226
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,790
some reason you fell in the pool and I

227
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,650
found you right here that's all mommy

228
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,890
could ever ask of you okay I am so proud

229
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,460
of you

230
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,430
yes he's such a good boy this is the

231
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,110
most that we're gonna get out of I'm

232
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,850
really impressed with how they did

233
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,580
marbles blew me away I've never been so

234
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,080
impressed I've never been so impressed

235
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,200
with anything he was going like 20 miles

236
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,940
an hour silently and his tail was

237
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,040
wagging they're not like jumping to get

238
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,380
in the water which i think is fine like

239
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,880
if they don't want to be swimmers that's

240
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,190
cool all I care about is like if they

241
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,690
fell in but they could figure their way

242
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,339
out and I think with like a lot more

243
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,290
time with them and working with them

244
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,180
with treats and like figuring out which

245
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,460
ways are safe for them to go like that's

246
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,249
all you could ever want

247
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:53,410
first time I'd say if I'd have to give a

248
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,410
gold star for today it would be you miss

249
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,259
wheet she has always been so trainable

250
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,350
and brave and sweet we're so proud of

251
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,360
you little girl she's like the one we

252
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,089
don't have to worry about you know good

253
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,970
well marbles - honestly we just have to

254
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,309
worry about Kermit all the time every

255
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:17,110
day I also figured out what makes him so

256
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,730
incredibly human is that he's the only

257
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,939
dog that I know that loves me

258
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:26,559
conditionally human yeah exactly it's

259
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,990
honestly one of the nicest things with

260
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,569
their coat it's just like a piece of

261
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,999
paper so they try in like four seconds

262
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,860
all right well I guess that's it I just

263
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,769
I really wanted to try this and see what

264
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,860
happen I've been shockingly pleasantly

265
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,680
surprised Hey shut the hell up shut up

266
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,180
all you guys are in life jackets you

267
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,100
look dumb I'm actually like looking

268
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,139
forward to continuing doing this with

269
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,120
them so that they can be comfortable

270
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,250
enough if they ever fall in the pool

271
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,059
again permit but they will be able to if

272
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,220
you have a dog and some water I

273
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,930
encourage you to work with them even if

274
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,610
they're little and you think that they

275
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,529
wouldn't enjoy it apparently if you just

276
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,970
get a life jacket and some treats

277
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,040
they'll do any thing myself

278
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,300
all right that's it make sure you

279
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,680
subscribe to my channel I put I do guys

280
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,269

281
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:25,720
