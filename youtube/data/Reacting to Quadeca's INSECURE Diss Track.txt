28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,560
everything is gonna go swimmingly I'm

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,610
being sarcastic

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,590
of course I knew shit was about to hit

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,659
the fan it wasn't a matter of if it was

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,780
definitely a matter of when and as soon

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,119
as the video got out let's just say a

34
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,520

first my diss track is gonna what and

36
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,939
yeah everybody even your own fans will

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,409
agree that you've taken it out because

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,150
you know your own fans they don't like

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,500
your music they like when you played

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,689
FIFA so I think we'll all agree that you

41
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,369
could bet that you can have this

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,170
mail it or I'll mail it to your PA box

43

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,789

48
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,659
see me in music so now we're in this

49
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,509
situation where dykes aunt Rebecca I've

50
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,270
released districts I think Dax is more

51
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,330
like a sliding whereas Quebec is it's a

52
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,120
full-blown district so we're gonna react

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,519
to Dax is fast obviously you gotta save

54
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,680
the best to last all right so this is

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,280
