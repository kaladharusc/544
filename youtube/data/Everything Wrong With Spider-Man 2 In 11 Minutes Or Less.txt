00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,560
in these movies to ever be anything at

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,479
Oscorp other than ahead of half-assing

44
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,740
crazy coincidence hey you're still here

45

yeah I mean this is the house where you

46
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,729
got verbally abused and why the fuck

47
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,050
would you stick around after the party

48
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,700
to hang their intelligence it's not a

49
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,580
privilege it's a gift and you use it for

50
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,229
the good of mankind you might even say

51
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,640
that with great intelligence comes great

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,590
I'll forget did beethoven's sleep before

53
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,540
he wrote the fifth did Bernoulli sleep

54
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,220
before he found the curves of quickest

55
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,140
descent brown-nosing he was studying

56
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,970
science and I was studying English

57
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,740
literature I was trying to explain the

58
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,450
theory of relativity well that must have

59
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,830
been one hell of an opening line to talk

60
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,459
to a girl hello my name is Otto Octavius

61
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,480
measurements of various quantities are

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,430
relative to the velocities of observers

63
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm going to a symposium on quantum

64
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,060
mechanics later you should come if you

65
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,380
want to get a woman to fall in love with

66
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,010
you Fito poetry never fails it fails the

67
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,750
fuck is he doing he already turned down

68
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,550
Mary Jane because he's spider-man and

69
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,170
could still have her if he wanted but

70
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,880
now he's brushing up on poetry because

71
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,130
also Peter reads poetry aloud in a

72
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,610
laundromat

73
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,290
Peter spidey senses blissfully unaware

74
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,190
of danger thirty feet behind him there

75
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,599
were a lot of cop cars behind Peter when

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,130
he made this leap but all the traffic in

77
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,630
this Lane is gone when he lands so that

78
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,680
he can have a cute moment with these

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,040
kids

80
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,470
his voice inspires one with absolute

81
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,660
credulity discount actress wrestler

82
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,890
announcer guy from the first movie

83
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,599
decided to pursue his dream of being a

84
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,630
theater usher in the second hired Peter

85
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,069
was only talking for one minute but the

86
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,780
payphone requests more money anyway Otto

87
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,150
skips over his finger Occulus cerebellum

88
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,220
attached smart bionic arm invention to

89
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,540
get to what ultimately is his failed

90
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,910
fusion reactor experiment I develop this

91
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,860
inhibitor chip to protect my higher

92
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,600
brain functions another miraculous

93
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
invention glossed over like it's nothing

94
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,230
what other world-changing inventions is

95
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,890
auto-create

96
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,690
and tossed aside in his path diffusion

97
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,460
now wearing the inhibitor chip gives a

98
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,020
person cancer so I had to cure that

99
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,520
before I could proceed with my research

100
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,630
brilliant thoughtful scientist thinks

101
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,200
that this is just a spike couldn't

102
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,550
Spidey have slung a bunch of webs and

103
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,920
unplug the fusion reactor for why didn't

104
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,060
he just kind of walk over and unplug

105
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,800
them rather than jumping to the ceiling

106
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,090
and announcing it with great power comes

107
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,590
great shards of glass that will kill

108
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,300
your wife Otto's wife looks good for

109
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,110
someone who got glassed in the face we

110
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,459
interrupt the spider-man movie to bring

111
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,290
you revenge of the sith this bank offers

112
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,790
a free toaster for opening an account

113
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,220
with $300 in it what is this the 50s

114
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,050
Peter just happens to be at the bank

115
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,940
when Doc Ock decides to rob it man in

116
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,860

stands staring at the bank vault for way

118
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,950
longer than any bank would allow without

119
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,630
some kind of security checking it also

120
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,550
do banks just have their huge safe and

121
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,410
public view aren't those usually tucked

122
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,090
in the back somewhere spidey sense its

123
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,070
kind of gone didn't it oh that boy yours

124
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,110

126
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,709
in their vault those fun things are

127
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,329
chocolates Peters powers go out during

128
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,799
the bank fight enough to further his own

129
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,479
self doubt but return just in time to

130
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,680
keep him from actually getting killed

131
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,510
because of their absence random victim

132
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,780
is not random of course because this

133
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,580
can't be a ruse at all man it's a good

134
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,870
thing she brought this umbrella even

135
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,220
though it's the sunniest day ever and

136
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,780
that she remembered it when she fled the

137
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,100
bank and that she never dropped it

138
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,329
during doc Ock's kidnapping

139
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,739
Aunt May is grabbed by Doctor Octopus

140
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,179
but we never hear him climb up to her

141
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,949
level which is impossible when he has

142
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,869
four metal claws grabbing into brick to

143
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:45,529
climb the building

144
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:46,909
all right men that old lady in the

145
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,799
vigilante are out of the way open fire

146
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,179
on that bad guy in the apartment

147
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,499
building full of people behind him you

148
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,209
sure showed him you sound exactly like

149
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,359
my nephew it would explain a lot yeah

150
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,219
but Mary Jane just happens to be dating

151
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:02,569
Jay jonah Jameson's son who cares so

152
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,669
much about me whoa whoa well they're

153
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,319
maybe they're best friends in the comics

154
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,729
are some but in these movies they

155
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,649
haven't come close to establishing any

156
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,899
kind of best friend relationship and I

157
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:14,019
just want you all to know that the

158
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,369
beautiful Miss Mary Jane Watson

159
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,619
it's just agreed to marry me this is

160
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,059
what we call an orgy of evidence that

161
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,889
Peters life sucks ass right now I mean

162
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,689
this is a nasty spill and if the webs

163
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:24,499
aren't working wouldn't the

164
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,749
super-strength also be failing even with

165
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:28,279
super-strength can you survive a fall

166
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,379
like this later he tries to climb the

167
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,879
wall and falls and his vision starts

168
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,129
sucking but strength all good Peter took

169
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,539
this newspaper from the dumpster all the

170
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:36,979
way home just so sam raimi could have

171
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,569
this cool little transition job these

172
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,309
blurry extras are all smiling and

173
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,809
watching Tobey Maguire do this silly

174
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,209
walk take real New Yorkers did not stop

175
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:54,589
and stare at silly walkers cheesy

176
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,239
freeze-frame Mary Jane didn't even hail

177
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,979
this cab the driver doesn't even look

178
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,899
like he knows she's about to get in 50

179
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,969
bucks I could get more than that on eBay

180
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,739
all right a hundred this guy accepts a

181
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,779
measly $100 for the Spidey costume

182
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,579
because Jonah and the movie just uh sure

183
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,739
amount without an argument 1977 New York

184
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,029
City attacks a guy in broad daylight

185
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,979
with thousands of people walking by well

186
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,299
there used to be thousands of people

187
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,949
walking by but they cleared out so Peter

188
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,210
could reflect on his goals and ideals

189
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,650
Harry's obsession with finding

190
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,240
spider-man never included following

191
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
Peter around or having him followed also

192
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Harry thinks he can find spider-man by

193
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,370
tracking him via newspaper article your

194
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,349
father only obsessed over his work

195
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,330
discount Alfred Pennyworth Hill

196
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,699
spider-man I'll give you all the tricky

197
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,560
meanings or you could just torture Harry

198
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,050
now and get it that way oh no spider-man

199
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,229
one got spliced into this movie

200
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,099
someone's child is in the burning

201
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,780
building cliche this doorknob would be

202
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,550
scalding hot in a burning building the

203
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,410
no powered Peter Parker holds on to a

204
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,940
legend while carrying a kid and this

205
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,310
movie's suspension of disbelief are you

206
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,289
fucking kidding me some poor soul died

207
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:57,370
trapped on the fourth floor

208
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,320
oh no if only Peter still had the powers

209
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,820
of spider-man he could totally have not

210
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,930
saved that guy anyway

211
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,330
where are all my comic books oh those

212
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,120
dreadful things I gave those away Aunt

213
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,330
May is a Philistine Henry and I agree we

214
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,889
don't see his picture in the paper

215
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,930
anymore was there chance you might

216
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,330
disagree about that it's like Henry need

217
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,270
a hero courageous self-sacrificing

218
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,310
people diabetics having a sugar low been

219
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,750
known to pop the scene of the movie in

220
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,220
to help give their glucose levels of

221
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,690
boost surely there's a safer way for

222
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,949
Peter to figure out if he could be

223
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,840
spider-man again like that time in the

224
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,099
first one where he was just trying to

225
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,349
climb a wall or spin a web I guess Peter

226
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,909
never needed Spidey powers to survive

227
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,190
Falls like this

228
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,230
back on the moon Wow lucky for Peter and

229
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,639
MJ that his powers just happened to

230
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,110
start working again one second before

231
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,580
they were both crushed by a car

232
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,560
also Doc Ock throws a motherfucking car

233
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,389
at the one guy he needs to get his

234
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,230
precious tritium

235
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,760
how did Doctor Octopus know that Peter

236
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,770
would be here so Doc Ock through a car

237
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,150
from some hidden place around where

238
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,530
these people are running with perfect

239
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,360
accuracy into a coffee shop that he

240
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,800
should have had no idea Peter was

241
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
actually in that should definitely have

242
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,330
killed it Mary Jane is in some kind of

243
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,040
danger cliche even though Peters mine

244
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
believed that he was no longer

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,770
spider-man the power of boners is

246
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,300
stronger well I won't be needing these

247
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,160
ever again for any reason for ever and

248
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,400
ever

249
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
hey guys quick question where is this

250
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,180
Webb attaching itself when spider-man

251
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,040
swings over to this clock tower ah the

252
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,110
downtown Manhattan elevated train they

253
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,490
shot this movie half a century ago you

254
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,010
know or in Chicago Doc Ock throws one

255
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,600
person at a time so that Spidey has a

256
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,080
chance to see Doc Ock considers the

257
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,580
throwing people off the train idea a

258
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,140
failure when he could have just upped

259
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,880
the ante by throwing more people he's

260
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,289
got four claws he could throw four

261
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,969
people and at the same time rather than

262
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,690
that one by one bolt during a life or

263
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,339
death situation this guy decides to be a

264
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,750
dick to the one guy who can save

265
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,440
everyone on the train

266
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,490
and there's one great shot of paper

267
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,210
football Jesus symmetry oh wow the mass

268
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,160
that he tore off while riding on top of

269
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,210
the subway 30 blocks ago good fine book

270
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,980
New Yorkers band together in a crisis

271
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,560
cliche and the tritium oh that we keep

272
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,940
that in a safe here in the penthouse

273
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,250
bedroom slash science storage facility

274
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,960
wait a second earlier he was unconscious

275
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,550
and then woke up and was so weak that

276
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,110
Doc Ock didn't have any trouble taking

277
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,910
him prisoner now he wakes up from a

278
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,470
second coma and suddenly he's fully

279
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,720
rested and strong like comas are like

280
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,290
refilling your health bar or something

281
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,430
[Music]

282
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,720
there are bigger things happening here

283
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,550
just say your father tried to kill me

284
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,810
with the blades on his glider and I

285
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,790
dodged it and it hit him instead that's

286
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,830
not a very long sentence Mary Jane is in

287
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,540
some kind of danger cliche this ball of

288
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,070
fusion is pulling the building apart and

289
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,840
even pulling random taxicabs and other

290
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,730
cars over in the city but then Spiderman

291
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,360
and alq

292
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,340
take like five minutes to get around to

293
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,810
stopping it and somehow the world hasn't

294
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,760
evaporated yet robotic smart arms have

295
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,170
the same weakness as the aliens and

296
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,740
signs sometimes to do what's right we

297
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,590
have to be steady and give up the thing

298
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,020
they want the most even our dreams and

299
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,250
with great power comes great

300
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,090
responsibility

301
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,890
it means Luca Brasi sleeps with the

302
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,110
fishes rosebud here's looking at you kid

303
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,300
that escalated quickly Coffee is for

304
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,700
closers only there are some sort of

305
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,350
powers I had that I could use to sling

306
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,360
you to safety

307
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,370
drop it oh wow the self-sustaining ball

308
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,870
of fusion power also has the same

309
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,480
weakness as the aliens from sines Mary

310
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,340
Jane is in some kind of danger cliche

311
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,750
I guess Aunt May was wrong in the first

312
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,460
movie spider-man is Superman unless I

313
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,350
get depressed or have an identity crisis

314
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,850
or whatever it was that caused me to

315
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,040
lose my powers in this movie I'm a new

316
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,900
Harry look in the first movie Norman

317
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,430
became insane after he tried to inject

318
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,230
himself with that serum but Harry

319
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,210
becomes insane because spider-man 3 has
