1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,680
all right Sonia despite the increase in

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,389
the cloud cover over the past couple of

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,130
hours temperatures have remained on the

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,080
warm side still in the lower 70s we had

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,950
a few more than that up to 76

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,740
October 23rd 2017 and it's 76 degrees

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,949
outside average weather for this the

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,840
average temperature for October 23rd is

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,359
50 degrees it is 26 degrees above normal

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,640
today I need an excuse to be outside for

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,380
today's video

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,320
[Music]

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,180
all these packages right here these are

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,370
mail time packages no I I genuinely

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,079
thought when I announced has me selling

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,970
my extra mail time stuff that people

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,180
would stop sending email time stuff but

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,379
more just keeps coming if you don't know

19
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,580
what I'm talking about a few months ago

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,839
I said I was gonna take all the mail

21
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,100
time stuff that I don't personally use

22
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,930
and sell it on eBay so far we've been

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,180
able to sell almost thirty five thousand

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,559
dollars worth of stuff and all that

25
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,610
money is gonna go help the people

26
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,800
affected by the hurricane who live in

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,420
Puerto Rico we're distributing it with a

28
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,830
couple of different nonprofits down

29
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,250
there but good work folks but one thing

30
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,450
that came in that really stood out that

31
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,460
I've wanted to make a video about is

32
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,830
this tiny electronic skateboard called

33
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,470
quick wheel I think it's called quick

34
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,729
wheel now if you've ever seen this

35
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,039
channel before all rightie of my videos

36
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,840
you know that I am the world's biggest

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,110
boosted board fan I own six of these

38
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,000
things I ride it literally every day of

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,560
my entire life and this electric

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,670
skateboard the boosted board has

41
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,259
literally changed the way I interact

42
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,030
with this entire city I don't ride a

43
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,679
bike I don't take the subway the only

44
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,050
way I really get around is on this thing

45
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,090
yeah I love the board it's the greatest

46
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,929
thing ever but I have one gigantic

47
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,250
persistent complained about the boosted

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,530
board and that is the price it is cost

49
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,509
prohibitive for most people so addition

50
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,160
to like me how tiny this thing is it's

51
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,649
also need 200 bucks which matter of

52
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,720
disclosure I wasn't hired I'm not being

53
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,550
paid by quick wheel to review this thing

54
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,140
initial sort of build quality on this it

55
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,700
feels like like a regular proper

56
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,649
skateboard see this is like it's what a

57
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,410
regular board decks made out of wheels

58
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,440
feel nice and gummy bearings I don't

59
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,310
know they seem fine

60
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,319
it looks like the motor is housed inside

61
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,090
of the wheel here and I think there's

62
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,190
just one motor just in this wheel

63
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,959
alright now for the real world test I

64
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,750
recruited my friend Sam helmet runner

65
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
kids when driving electric skateboard of

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,870
any kind safety matters

67
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,540
so we're gonna go to the west side works

68
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,160
like a safe place to tap these things

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,930
what is interesting though is my ability

70
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,050
to carry this skateboard while riding my

71
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,830
big skateboard

72
00:02:45,830 --> 00:03:10,860
[Music]

73
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,780
so just to show off the sides before we

74
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,030
actually test this this is your regular

75
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,910
penny board here look it it's smaller

76
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,490
than a regular sized penny board this is

77
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,620
your regular sized backpack almost sort

78
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,520
of fits right in the back it spins ready

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,110
silent

80
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,510
[Music]

81
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:51,360
[Music]

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,340
it's much harder to balance on the Naboo

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,780
support you look so goofy right it's

84
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,030
like a toy I mean I have to say the

85
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,859
responsiveness is pretty good

86
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,700
like the speed top that do not have the

87
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,799
confidence on this that you do on a

88
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,850
boost at work

89
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,850
already this is the breakdown 3 2 1

90
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,120
break there's not much for breaks

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,550
alright dude do I have to

92
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:35,680
[Music]

93
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:57,350
[Music]

94
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,700
baby

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,340
[Music]

96
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,650
you look great

97
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,510
[Music]

98
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,080
so I guess the question is is this a toy

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,090
or is this like an actual means of

100
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,400
transportation it's it's a toy I think

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,730
this is a toy but airports airports

102
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,410
travel what else is this useful for if

103
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,150
you have a huge house a good way to get

104
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,820
around your home yeah I mean at 200

105
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,770
bucks it's not a bad Toyota play with

106
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,060
like I don't have many bad things to say

107
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,610
about this it's really small and as

108
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,840
someone who's been skateboarding for a

109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,730
while there's really not much room to

110
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,830
put your feet so one thing that is

111
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,590
interesting it's both the size and the

112
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,930
Flex of the boosted board that lets you

113
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,060
come over bumps and if you hit little

114
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,100
potholes or cracks it can handle it so

115
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,780
this board has neither size nor flex so

116
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,970
when you hit a bump you really feel it

117
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,410
most of the take offs not much

118
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,770
alright so epic conclusion here it's a

119
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,650
cool device I think they're only 200

120
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,280
bucks which is a great price but I don't

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,260
think that feels safe the way that a

122
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,790
boosted board does I think boosted's the

123
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,020
only electric skateboard I've ever

124
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,260
ridden that actually feels safe to ride

125
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,550
if you're a parent thing you get it for

126
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,810
your kids then you live on a cul-de-sac

127
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,050
and it's a flat ground yeah maybe maybe

128
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,060
a fun toy if you're thinking about this

129
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,860
for any form of viable transportation

130
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,200
even if you live on a college campus I

131
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,630
give it a no the same it's it's

132
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,910
dangerous it's dangerous but it is fun

133
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,850
and 200 bucks is an insane price

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,289
only electric skateboard that weighs

less than three kilograms you know one

141
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,190
day I do have a quick question about

142
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,990
when it comes to this skateboard on

143
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,789
their IndieGoGo page it looks like like

144
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,280
a crowdsource thing the company quick

145
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,830
wheel it says in San Francisco but the

146
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,289
voiceovers like this weird word is made

147
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,080
of computerized voice and then there's

148
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,840
like two very American looking bros who

149
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,699
star in the video but it's filmed in

150
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,650
China I have nothing against products

151
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,569
made in China just if it's a Chinese

152
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,370
company own that it's a Chinese company

153
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,470
and don't front like it's a San

154
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,979
Francisco startup this is a robot word

155
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,750
why does it seem like they're posing as

156
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,900
a Bay Area look that's China yeah yeah

157
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,550
that's bizarre weird right
