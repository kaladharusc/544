58
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,390
so far what do we know we know that in that gigantic box were three slightly

59
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,740
smaller boxes

60
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:54,300
let's have a look in the first slightly smaller box we have

61
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:08,580
a brand-new DJI phantom 4 road in the second box

62
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:16,860
we have another DJI phantom 4 drone and in the first box

63
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,860
we have a third DJI phantom 4 drone

64
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,779
now I don't know a lot but I do know that no man needs seven drones and i

65
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,439
already have four bring it on it and bring it up

66
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,219
and since DJ I just gave these to me

67
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm trying to say their name a lot by the way so maybe we'll give me more

68
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,180
dji:djia since I just gave these to me i'm going to give all three of them away

69
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,740
and do another giveaway

70
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,120
I don't really know like I don't really know the best way to structure this

71
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,990
giveaway

72
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,379
but since i have three of them I'll drag it out over like a week but i will give

73
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,669

74
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:02,610

77
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,589

78
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:17,759
way to give away these two drones but come on

79
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,270
three brand new drone and it's

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:33,460
it's my favorite robe that hole

81
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,460
mailtime drone time business took me like 20 minutes

82
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,460
look at the destruction

83
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,460
no can i film something on your fire see sure that our kin in exchange for

84
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,260
letting me use your fire escape

85
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,720
I brought you all the skin tight so these they're delicious

86
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,720
thanks

87
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,280
sweet

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,590
alright so i'm going to be giving away those drones and since i've been using

89
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,700
grown so much lately

90
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,570
I thought share with you some of my thoughts on drugs see I always thought

91
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,710
that drones were like flying cameras and all I need to learn how to do is how to

92
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,590
get the thing in the air without crashing it and have this magical

93
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,250
cinematography to use to help me tell stories

94
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,039
I was wrong no I had a fly drone is one-third of the pie that is actually

95
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,140
having meaningful footage from a drill

96
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,099
the other two pieces are being a drone cinematographer and then knowing what to

97
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,380
use the footage for let me tell you something

98
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,750
no one gives a shit about pretty aerial cinematography

99
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,660
you're never going to be as good as national Geographics you're never going

100
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,510
to be as good as killed Scott see nobody cares

101
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,250
use that aerial footage to help tell your story to give context to a scene of

102
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,660
contact so what's going on to help me the viewer understand what I'm seeing

103
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
all of these things I've learned in the last couple of weeks trying to integrate

104
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,390
drone into this show in a meaningful way

105
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,250
thank you for letting me use your fire stick my pleasure good luck with that

106
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,000
candy

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
thank you letter scar

108
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,440
yeah

109
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,570
ok
