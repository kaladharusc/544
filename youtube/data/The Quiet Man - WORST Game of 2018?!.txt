00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,070
hey guys angry Joe another Joe here

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,529
quick show update sorry

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,200
Red Dead Redemption review of still

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
working on its you know families getting

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,790
in the way and we're waiting on our

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,500
costumes to show it should show up this

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,000
week massive epic game and pretty much

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,109
just 100% finished it so I definitely

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,260
want to do it angry review for that but

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,689
please be patient wait a little longer

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,670
on that when I told y'all I wasn't gonna

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,610
rush it so sorry it's a good game yes

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,040
it's it deserves a little more attention

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,260
I was thinking about waiting until the

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,239
multiplayer component comes out but I

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,920
think I'll probably just put it out

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,360
before then cuz it might be another

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,789
month or something so but in the

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,140
meantime we're gonna be putting up some

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,600
video content in between now and that

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,940
review one of them is this this video

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,370
here the quiet man this game is so bad

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,190
that I might actually have to do an

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,140
angry review in addition to what you're

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,830
seeing here but this is so funny this

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,250
game is so bad it's so funny we had we

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,119
played it on stream and I don't know boy

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,100
we almost lost our minds you need to

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,320
watch this you need to slowly watch us

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,320
lose our minds and get really angry so

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,299
but this is a shit game nobody should

32
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,850
buy it so who the hell cares about the

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,740
spoilers but thank you for letting him

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,610
know Joe so Red Dead will put up maybe

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,530
one or two more Let's Plays in the

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,630
meantime because I've got something like

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,880
80 hours of footage to sort through and

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,570
edit and I don't want to redo some of

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,790
the ideas already did for our original

40
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,710
Red Dead Redemption review so I should

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,180
probably put that one up it's in its

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,149
entirety but so please be patient on

43
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,470
that we're gonna do other Let's Plays

44
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,570
and and then after Red Dead we'll

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,140
probably maybe do a quiet man review but

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,640
then we're gonna be running into what

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,750
does it fall out and things like that so

48
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,180
go buckle down for November homeboy

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,729

see this is a little annoying now

107
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,360
because this is literally dialogue but

108
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
we're not allowed to hear it because the

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,510
quiet man is deaf but if you're gonna do

110
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,660
a game from that unique perspective you

111
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,370
have to build your game around it it

112
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,110
feels like the game wasn't built around

113
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,610
it and then last minute they say you

114
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,460
know be cool it shut off the sound you

115
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,140
know what I mean it feels like an

116
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,470
afterthought so he only hears his

117
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:57,430

violent they did all the research about

175
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,930
videogames does not make you violent

176
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:49,170
that's because they didn't research I do

177

197
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:55,980
[Laughter]

198
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,590
I'm gonna give this one out of ten we

199
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,570
were out of tube

200
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,710
I might actually give this game zero

201
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,410
fucking works well does it really work

202
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,480
the fact that you took out all the audio

203
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,060
ruined all the performances my god I'd

204
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,050
like to see the live action for this let

205

207
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,700
randomly go back to normal so you didn't

208
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,560
even have the balls or the budget to do

209
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:43,710

they set these people off like they're

217
00:23:41,750 --> 00:24:02,770
like master fighters or something

218

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:38,260
hopefully this game doesn't suck in 13

222
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,049
out of 10 Joe because they saved the

223
00:24:41,049 --> 00:25:02,049
word the very end oh shit

224
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,820
perhaps the truth still lies on Sun

225
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:10,240
waiting to be finally understood right

226
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,639
is this the developer going back to his

227
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:23,100
house drinking a bit to be answered

228
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,269
don't in five days seconds minutes hours

229
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:31,840
days whatever

230
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,570
oh I thought we were gonna sit there and

231
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,990
wait at that screen for five days so

232
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,440
sound is coming and finding Joe look

233
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,029
it's waiting to play fucking dawn so

234
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,500
what did you think of the fucking game

235
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,240
the worst fucking thing I've ever played

236
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,120
it's so bad I said it countless times

237
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,639
while we were playing the fucking thing

238
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:05,110
it's so cringy it's so pretentious in

239
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,909
its live-action parts the story

240
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:12,070
nonsensical it does a distance to the

241
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,440
actors who play who played their hearts

242
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,659
out to try to make the material work and

243
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,760
because they ripped the sound away it

244
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,679
fucking doesn't work I wonder if they

245
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,690
knew going into it it's like hey we're

246
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:22,990
not

247
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,760
they knew they had a piece of shit on

248
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,030
their hand they had their poles they

249
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,580
pulled this for a gimmick in order to

250
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,220
get people interested in it and and

251
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,059
that's why it's $15 in fact it was

252
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,920
$13.50 because there's a percent off

253
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,390
during their launch week because they

254
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,429
knew it was such a piece of shit the

255
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:45,520
combat in the game so you you watch

256
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,850
cutscenes and you do combat the

257
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,890
cutscenes are awful as I just explained

258
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,809
and the combat is even worse it is

259
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,360
repetitive it's the same fucking moves

260
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,730
over and over there's zero variation

261
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,250
it's the same character models over and

262
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,520
over it's absolute absolute words I

263
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,110
don't know if I can forget about a game

264
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,440
like this guys bye guys thank you so
