jontron

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,600
man look at all these games they just

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,960
don't make the white coolspot anymore

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,130
differently than you my yearning for a

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,260
real game I can't based off something

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,630
terrible from the nineties starring Tim

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,370
Allen that's the one I want if only it

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:54,390
would make a home improvement video game

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,610
Almond proof oh the memories just come

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,190
flooding back it was a television sitcom

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,380
back in the 90s it started the Oscar

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,120
gobbling career of Tim Allen and

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,800
surprisingly the television career of

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,470
Pamela Anderson Watts that's what I said

16
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,460
it was the show one of those concoctions

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,260
of the 90s moral culture and family

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,750
centric importance like most shows of

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,130
this caliber the cheesy level was

20
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,869
somewhere between family matters in full

21
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,670
house if you go past full house I

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,200
seriously think you just disappear into

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:33,700
the void uncharted territory look aside

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,100
the main point is they made a game out

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,979
of this right really I understand the

26
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,420
back then if it had a face they made a

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,640
fricking game out of it but really own

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,460
improvement the game I mean for shit's

29
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,530
sake have some restraint that's about as

30
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,000
good of an idea as making a first-person

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,399
shooter on a sister sister ah my

32
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,369
favorite publisher absolutely copied

33
00:01:54,369 --> 00:02:05,289
Sierra's logo so we start off here on

34
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,119
the set of tool time you know that weird

35
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,399
show the Tim Allen had in the show that

36
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,709
holy would have been a viable show real

37
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,170
life by the way I would pay to see that

38
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,130
shit I'd sit in the splash zone why say

39
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,290
it so seriously it's just them talking

40
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,420
to this one swanky loop from the coolest

41
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,170
club in town

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,580
did I say swanky let me just go ahead

43
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,710
and rearrange that there we go

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,050
so like they just talk for like five

45
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,010
hours

46
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,440
seriously look how long this dialog is

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,880
back at base they were like okay our

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,160
demographic is kids now what a kids like

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,660
how about a series of levels where Tim

50
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,100
Allen explores the true depth of his

51
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,800
love for his family and wife

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,950
or fuckin Boonton car seems pretty she

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,010
so as all great storylines go someone

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,450
steals one of the tools he needs on his

55
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,160
show and leaves him a cryptic serial

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,600
killer message that if he ever wants to

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,150
see this tool again he has to go back to

58
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,830
the Stone Age I can't believe Oh where's

59
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,960
the Pillsbury Dough Boy award follows

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,070
what's the run

61
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,780
Paul Newberry the one the one who we

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,940
were kids so naturally that means the

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,920
set next door is in the Stone Age

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,920
okay yeah it could be worse see I've

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,470
seen worse so immediately he's doing

66
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,320
this annoying shit just like immediately

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,470
he's doing this whoa hey geez man I

68
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,570
don't remember ordering any jalapenos on

69
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,150
this Pizza what's all this he's kind of

70
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,160
like 10 different dazzling moves and I

71
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,350
have no idea what any of them do it just

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,320
felt Sparkle I mean the graphics are

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,690
appealing so far I just look at this

74
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,730
this is ridiculous I never once in my

75
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,110
life thought I'd ever be making Tim

76
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,270
Allen scoot along on a jackhammer you

77
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,770
get different weapons and use it with a

78
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,360
and that's basically all you'll be using

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,280
none of this des little sparkles you

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,770
know so as you may have guessed the main

81
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,200
enemy here is going to be dinosaurs yeah

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,790
I mean after all the first thing I think

83
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,830
of what I think a home improvement is

84
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,140
dinosaurs yep have you noticed that I

85
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,180
tend to review things about dinosaurs a

86
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,860
lot I swear I didn't even notice until

87
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,750
you guys pointed it out to me it is what

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,880
you might call a coincidence this time

89
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,410
as well I mean I picked this game

90
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,940
because I wanted to see what I would get

91
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,440
from a home improvement Super Nintendo

92
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
game and I got Dysart

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,180
I'd be crazy if I said this isn't what I

94
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,140
was expecting

95
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,910
it's just like when you see a spider mob

96
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,040
in an MMO or a skeleton enemy in an RPG

97
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,810
it's like wow how long did it take you

98
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,100
to come up with that one you really

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,960
breaking new grounds here guys so

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,190
basically what you're doing here is

101
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,840
going around and collecting scattered

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,010
praise because they were too lazy to

103
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,780
make a real game there's like five or

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,480
six or 80 on each level only problem is

105
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
you don't know where they are so you got

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,450
to navigate this completely repetitive

107
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,460
and mind-bending landscape to find them

108
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,930
and most of the time you just end up

109
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,400
running in circles all over the damn

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,100
place you can usually tell how blatantly

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,660
terrible a game is gonna be if it's made

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,120
like this with the whole collect X&amp;Y

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,010
level before reaching the exit sort of

114
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,700
thing

115
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,620
it can be done well like in Zombies Ate

116
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,240
My Neighbors and in fact that may be the

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,310
finest example of this format the way it

118
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,990
was done in Mighty Max and in this game

119
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,660
are the completely wrong way to do it I

120
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,760
don't think of it this game is an awful

121
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,310
lot like Mighty Max like wow really a

122
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,200
lot I guess this was just the good old

123
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,120
formula for making a game sucked back in

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,220
the 16-bit era so back to these enemies

125
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,070
I was talking about they impossible well

126
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,390
they made sure that no matter what

127
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,160
you're doing when you're doing it you're

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,020
gonna be getting hit by something this

129
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,790
freaking a carrier get hit by a

130
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,950
dragonfly you fall you slide backwards

131
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,450
in Wrath you end up getting hit by a

132
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,800
projectile with trying to dodge a

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,450
pterodactyl shit names everywhere

134
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,770
you're supposed to feel like you can

135
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,570
dodge enemies in a game another big

136
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,920
problem with this game is you can't rush

137
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,420
through it like a cannon Mario or Sonic

138
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,520
or Donkey Kong it you gotta play it like

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,330
surgery or you're going to die a lot you

140
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,070
would probably be disgusted if you knew

141
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,350
how many times I died just on this first

142
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,840
level it's incredibly unforgiving so

143
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,790
let's go down here for a sec what did I

144
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,350
see what am I seeing here would know

145
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,270
what about now is this is this am i

146
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,490
right now at this moment as Tim Allen

147
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,950
from home improvement using a lightsaber

148
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,260
chainsaw to fight arrested I don't know

149
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,540
how much longer I can last this out okay

150
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,190
so like you gotta find the boxes but

151
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,330
where the hell are they it doesn't tell

152
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,150
you Oh unless you stand still for a few

153
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,000
seconds I mean if it just tells you

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,590
anyways why isn't it on your heads-up

155
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,270
display what inevitably ends up

156
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,740
happening is you start periodically

157
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,390
standing around like an idiot watching

158
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,190
Tim Allen use what he read in a book was

159
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,110
humor as the game tells you the exact

160
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,970
direction to go oh is less than

161
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,100
thrilling alright I got one box left to

162
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,360
go let me just go ahead and try to get

163
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,830
it easy okay sweet next level alright so

164
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,060
it's like the same thing as the first

165
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,470
level but with a night filter in the

166
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,540
background hey it's no Picasso but it's

167
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,430
easy on the eyes this time around we got

168
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,290
these piranha plant foods but wait a

169
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,420
second don't that guy look a bit

170
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,980
familiar

171
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,420
ah okay so these bolts are telling me to

172
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,890
jump over to that platform nothing

173
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,290
unusual here okay this is a cruel trick

174
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,690
okay so you can get across I just didn't

175
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,070
jump well enough go figure

176
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,570
well now that we've gotten past this

177
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,770
let's have it lead us to the exit

178
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:22,310
[Music]

179
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,930
it obviously led me over here with the

180
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,500
bolts

181
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
why the hell does the ledge which looks

182
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,040
like an area to leap from lead to

183
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,260
absolutely nothing everything in this

184
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,750
game is maddening to the eyes not only

185
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,490
can I not figure out where to go but

186
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,140
when I'm walking casually around the

187
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,900
game leads me into death traps no I'm

188
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,550
done the gigs up I am no longer

189
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,770
subjecting myself to this story that

190
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,050
would be max baucus take as for the rest

191
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,520
of this game I mean what do you expect

192
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,100
no seriously what do you expect because

193
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,990
it's what gets what you expect it's like

194
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,480
space robot level ancient pyramids level

195
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,820
Oh is a haunted house level Mighty Max

196
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,920
the entire fucking game is in here as a

197
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,370
level

198
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,290
what's the cliche you know of the a is

199
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,330
all improvement level I'm surprised we

200
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,130
didn't see a level where is it and who

201
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,719
stole the cookies from the cookie jar

202
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,899
