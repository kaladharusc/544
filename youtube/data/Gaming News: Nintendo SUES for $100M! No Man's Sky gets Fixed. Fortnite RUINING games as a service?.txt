1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,650
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,510
YouTube boogie2988 coming at you lavas

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,069
getting to the power of the internet and

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,450
it's time from a weekly gaming news show

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,570
so let's get right into the games first

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,950
topic I want to talk about this week I

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,870
want to talk about no man's sky next

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,759
because everybody loves a redemption

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,500
story and this is probably one of the

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,039
best redemption stories in gaming now in

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,240
case you're not caught up with a history

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,650
of no man's sky it's a game that's been

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,510
out for a couple of years it was heavily

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,740
hyped by the folks over there at

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,840
PlayStation it had a trailer that made

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
the game look absolutely amazing at Jeff

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,009
Keeley's The Game Awards and when the

18
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,320
game finally came out it was basically

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,600
in early access a lot of the features

20
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,129
that have been promised simply were not

21
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,140
there and there was absolutely no sign

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,579
that they were going to be there the

23
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,170
game was definitely not the game it was

24
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,180
hyped up to be upon release the game

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,489
promised all kinds of crazy stuff

26
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,899
procedurally generated planets with lots

27
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,760
of different diversity and life on it a

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,590
deep crafted crafting system a

29
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,379
deep-space exploration system

30
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,910
multiplayer all kinds of great stuff

31
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,059
that just simply wasn't there and this

32
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,949
was made so much worse because the

33
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,180
creator of the game just before the

34
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,100
game's launch promised all this really

35
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,780
crazy stuff they promised all this stuff

36
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,060
that just simply wasn't in the game and

37
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,140
I guess they could have easily just

38
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,600
pocketed the money and left but for the

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,580
last two years they have been working on

40
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,040
this game now resulting in what they're

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,380
calling version 1.5 I guess the no man's

42
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,630
sky next patch it is basically a mega

43
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,150
patch which adds a lot of new stuff to

44
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,710
the game a lot of depth to the game and

45
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,630
one of the biggest promises Shaun Murray

46
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,000
made which is multiplayer hey here's the

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,189
thing it's still no man's sky if the

48
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,960
initial launch didn't please you at

49
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,060
least a little bit as it did me then

50
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,470
you're probably later like no man's sky

51
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,960
next it's still minecraft in space with

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,159
space exploration

53
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,170
naming animals naming plants naming

54
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,520
rocks now with base building now the

55
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,710
vehicles now with cooler planets to look

56
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,869
at and more diverse biomes but it's

57
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,399
still pretty much the same game only

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,380
with a lot more depth and a lot more

59
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,180
content here's the thing though if you

60
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,110
already bought it and you held on to

61
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,030
that copy without refunding it now it's

62
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,380
a good time to reinstall it in a sense

63
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,759
it's on sale for about half off right

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,229
now at about 30 bucks everywhere

65
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,450
including I think on Xbox now then it

66
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,770
might be something you wanted to have a

67
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,909
with I would definitely watch somebody

68
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,110
play it first to make sure it's the kind

69
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,610
of game you're interested in but I think

70
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,020
if you're interested in this I can

71
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,819
highly recommend this version of the

72
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,270
game but this does creative

73
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,250
of an ethical quandary should we reward

74
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,650
them for doing this or should we not I

75
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,660
love a redemption story and I love the

76
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,920
fact that instead of pocketing the money

77
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,720
and running they decided to create the

78
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
game they always wanted to create with

79
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,110
the money that they took in I think

80
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,640
that's fantastic it's certainly not the

81
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,050
first time that's happened but it's

82
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,790
certainly the most visible example of it

83
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,170
ever happening or didn't play a games

84
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,060
that came up to critical failure that

85
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,520
have been worked on and fixed but this

86
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,650
is certainly the most visible one yet

87
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,570
and I'm very very proud of the job that

88
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,340
Shaun Murray and his team did I'm so

89
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,020
glad that he stuck to it even dealing

90
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,520
with the death threats and all the crazy

91
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,170
stuff had to deal with they still made

92
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,460
the game they promised and this is

93
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,510
really close to the game they've

94
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,070
promised but I want to pass the question

95
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,510
off to you do you think we should be

96
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,130
rewarding hello games and Shaun Murray

97
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,080
for this kind of behavior do you think

98
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,580
we should buy the game now that they've

99
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,080
completed it to reward them for sticking

100
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,270
it out do you think we should still be

101
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,710
mad about the hype train and in the

102
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,120
derailment and all of the stuff that

103
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,050
happened before let me know in the

104
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,130
comments section below

105
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,050
in my personal opinion I think this is

106
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,150
great they completed the game they made

107
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,740
it as good as they could and I'm glad to

108
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,120
throw money at them but I'm only one

109
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,070
consumer I'm curious as to what you

110
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,960
think because you guys make up the bulk

111
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,390
of my audience and then obviously your

112
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,980
dollars count way more than mine now

113
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,209
this week's episode is sponsored by the

114
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,070
folks over at glass is USA and you can

115
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,240
find the link in the description box

116
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,720
below

117
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,100
they make literally every pair of

118
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,840
glasses you see me wear on this channel

119
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,280
in the last couple of years including

120
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,840
these awesome prescription sunglasses

121
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm taken to the RTX with me this week

122
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,800
and the reason I go with glasses USA is

123
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,450
because when I go to the eye doctor and

124
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,950
get my prescription they always try to

125
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,420
upsell you on the glasses and make as

126
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,459
much profit as they can but glasses USA

127
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,520
they have glasses as inexpensive as 48

128
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,530
dollars for the frames and the lenses

129
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,060
together all you got to do is click on

130
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,170
the link of the description box below

131
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,000
and you can start shopping for thousands

132
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,770
of different styles and you can upload a

133
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,390
picture of your face and then virtually

134
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,730
try on each pair of glasses to see what

135
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,380
you're gonna look like it'll have twenty

136
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,270
four-hour-a-day customer support they

137
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,150
have a 14 day money-back guarantee so if

138
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,530
you try a pair of glasses and you don't

139
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,730
like them for any reason you can get a

140
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,860
full refund the best part about it is if

141
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,610
you click on the link of the description

142
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,470
box below and start shopping for glasses

143
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,270

144
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,709
deeper discount on their already

145
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,600
discounted prices you'll be wearing the

146
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,310
exact same kind of glasses I wear in

147
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,500
every single episode and then on top of

148
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,270
that you'll be supporting me at the same

149
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,610
time while you save a buttload of money

150
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,810
such

151
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,310
here's a quick little story about a game

152
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,620
I bet you didn't even know existed there

153
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,300
was a game called the culling which was

154
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,680
one of the very first battle Royales to

155
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,419
market it was fairly unique because I

156
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,310
had a lot of cool Malay weapons and the

157
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,050
way it played was fairly different from

158
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,029
the rest but they continued to work on

159
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,409
that game as it was released in early

160
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,349
access and they made it friendly

161
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,460
unrecognizable from the initial version

162
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,020
scaring off a large portion of the

163
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,249
player base and then in order to try to

164
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:50,139
get that player base back they launched

165
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,479
a sequel to the game called the calling

166
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,449
- and this launch went so badly that you

167
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,310
literally could not get enough people

168
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,319
into a battle royale game with only 50

169
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,240
people in it by the way to actually play

170
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,279
the game you could win a battle royale

171
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,379
game just by queueing up and no one else

172
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,000
joining and you would automatically win

173
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,860
because you would be the only person in

174
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,050
it you wouldn't even load the map you

175
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,849
would just get the victory after a few

176
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,680
days of this they decided to pull this

177
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,500
game off of market and refund everybody

178
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,469
that purchased it Wow

179
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,639
now there's a lot of different reasons

180
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,349
that this happened and I could go into

181
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:25,150
it for a while but I'm just gonna say it

182
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,669
boiled down to two major things a lot of

183
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,319
bad decisions from the folks over there

184
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,270
developing these games but more

185
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,210
importantly the saturation of the battle

186
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,710
royale market you've got fortnight

187
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,020
you've got pub G you got h1z1 you've got

188
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,639
all these other different games realm

189
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,750
rolling out some of the smaller games

190
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,580
there's so many battle Royales

191
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,560
out right now and there's so many yet to

192
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,750
come if you are currently developing a

193
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,289
battle royale don't just stop Activision

194
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,060
EA I don't know why you guys are wasting

195
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,649
your money on something like this but

196
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,360
just know there's only so many players

197
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,279
interested in battle royale and they're

198
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,779
already playing a game they've picked

199
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,610
the game they suck money into that game

200
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,069
I know you want that kind of money but

201
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,750
just know you should probably find a

202
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,849
different life service to bec use the

203
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,979
calling - as a warning sign this is the

204
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,560
albatross around your neck pay attention

205
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,180
if you're developing a battle royale

206
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,089
game stop and if you don't mind me like

207
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,979
waxing poetic and theory crafting here

208
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,629
just a little bit let me just go ahead

209
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,399
and say the problem with these types of

210
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,289
games is fairly simple but it comes to

211
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,580
fortnight when it comes to League of

212
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,990
Legends when it comes to overwatch

213
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,689
there's only so many eSports players in

214
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,159
the world there's only so many players

215
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,139
who are gonna spend their every waking

216
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,839
moment grinding away at your competitive

217
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,180
game now that's a good number of people

218
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,540
and yes when a game is very-very

219
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,100
popular like league of legends was like

220
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,500
World of Warcraft was like a fortnight

221
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,420
now is you will add new players that

222
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,920
normally would not be doing that but

223
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,960
it's a small number of players when it

224
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,450
comes to games as a service you pretty

225
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,280
much can only play one maybe two games

226
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,410
consistently at a time and I guarantee

227
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,670
if you're watching this right now and

228
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,570
you do play one of these games

229
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,790
competitively you used to be a huge fan

230
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,290
of an older franchise you've now

231
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,360
abandoned for a newer game that you're

232
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,640
currently obsessed with you are a finite

233
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,890
resource I am a finite resource if

234
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,540
you're developing games right now I

235
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,310
wouldn't try to tap into that market as

236
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,830
profitable as it seems do something that

237
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,570
the markets not doing smaller games

238
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,060
single-player games one-and-done games

239
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,920
games that people like me will still

240
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
consume because we're not spending all

241
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,850
our time playing fortnight or League of

242
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,350
Legends or something repetitive like

243
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,050
that you saw with the MMORPG market it

244
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,760
definitely happened there a lot of

245
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,110
people tried to get in on that and they

246
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,660
all fell they all lost their asses same

247
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,280
with battle Royales or whatever the next

248
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,930
flavor of the day is do something

249
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,600
different be the next new thing be the

250
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,400
next new thing that everybody hops on

251
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,590
that's how you get rich while we're at

252
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,610
it while we're talking about for tonight

253
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,930
by the way what does everybody hate that

254
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,400
game right now I mean a lot of people

255
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,960
love it I didn't feel pretty indifferent

256
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,460
about it I've dabbled with it but every

257
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,750
time I mention it in the title or a

258
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,310
thumbnail you guys go ballistic in the

259
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,080
comments section if you are one of those

260
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,790
people can you tell me why you hate that

261
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,260
game so much in the comments section

262
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,760
because I'd really really like to know I

263
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,900
don't hate it

264
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,810
I don't hate much of anything yeah

265
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,550
battlefront 2 but doesn't that and it's

266
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,260
that time a week where we crap all over

267
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,930
Nintendo because Nintendo has decided to

268
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,460
arm themselves with a group of lawyers

269
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,760
to crush the hopes and dreams of fans

270
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,130
and people who love retro gaming so

271
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,380
let's get into that I guess so before

272
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,490
you can understand this story let me

273
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,440
explain to you the basic concept of a

274
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,360
ROM a ROM is a digital file that

275
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,610
contains the original source files of a

276
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,530
game let's say like Super Mario Brothers

277
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,050
and then you can basically download that

278
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,630
and use an emulator to play those games

279
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,300
now that's technically illegal to do

280
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,240
unless you have a physical copy of the

281
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,770
original game in your possession you own

282
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,660
that game you've purchased that game you

283
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,729
have then it's perfectly legal to do

284
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,440
that to create a backup file to share

285
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,840
download backup files of a game that you

286
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,940
currently are in possession of otherwise

287
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,950
you pretty much break in copyright law

288
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,750
and because of that sharing roms has

289
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,760
always been kind of a legal gray area

290
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,769
here in the United States but we know

291
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,750
the Nintendo especially here on YouTube

292
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,910
does not like legal gray areas they like

293
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,470
to make sure they are in complete

294
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,570
control of how everybody monetizes

295
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,269
everything they do so this next chunk of

296
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,620
the story should not surprise you in the

297
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,899
least so two examples of a Nintendo

298
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,120
lawyer up and flexing that lawyer muscle

299
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,410
and all that money they have a hind I'm

300
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,970
the first of which was a gameboy

301
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,040
advanced emulator that was hosted over

302
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,410
at github it was a JavaScript emulator

303
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,790
which allowed you to basically play

304
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,959
those games that you may or may not

305
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,300
legally be allowed to play through that

306
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,800
javascript emulator but because they

307
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
were hosting those roms in order for

308
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
them to boot up in the JavaScript

309
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,769
basically Nintendo said that would be

310
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:34,190
illegal

311
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,779
we want to shut you down and if you

312
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,610
don't shut it down we'll sue you they

313
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,110
decided to play along they decided to go

314
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,550
ahead and shut it down it's a simple

315
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,779
story they're not much to talk about

316
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,540
there the second story is a little more

317
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,370
interesting because they are suing a

318
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,810
small website developer for 100 million

319
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,899
dollars give or take for hosting roms on

320
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,949
two different websites now these

321
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,779
websites were and they're both gone now

322
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,920
is love roms calm and love retro dot Co

323
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,810
now these websites have been around for

324
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,399
a while and surely Nintendo knew about

325
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,570
them these were two of the most popular

326
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,670
emulation websites on the internet so

327
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,589
there's plenty of other websites just

328
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:10,550
like it if you want to download

329
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,310
interneurons right now it is super super

330
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,220
easy to do but Nintendo decided to shut

331
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,709
this one down because they were wearing

332
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,420
one of those popular ones they allege in

333
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,769
the lawsuit that they got about 17

334
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,500
million page views a month which is very

335
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,670
considerable and then on top of that

336
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,589
they were monetizing at making money

337
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:28,790
from doing this and in the lawsuit

338
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,459
Nintendo said this isn't just a fan this

339
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,660
isn't just a small group of dedicated

340
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,730
fans who love the games who are doing

341
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,380
this these are people who have marketed

342
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,790
this these are people who are making

343
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,260
money from it they have created a small

344
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,449
business based of it and we don't want

345
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,920
them making money off of our

346
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,810
intellectual property and they actually

347
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,220
sued them for a hundred and fifty

348
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,620
thousand dollars dollars worth of damage

349
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,959
per individual ROM they were hosting

350
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,899
which adds up to over a hundred million

351
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,209
dollars worth of damages now Nintendo

352
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,410
will never see a dime of that money

353
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,110
quite clearly they'll just shut down the

354
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,790
websites and then end it all and

355
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,290
hopefully it'll the case will get

356
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,560
dismissed or thrown out of court

357
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,060
hopefully it won't ruin these people's

358
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,220
lives but hey Nintendo doesn't care

359
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,600
either way if they run a life or not as

360
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,310
long as they get this shut down and

361
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,140
people aren't making money off of their

362
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,090
intellectual property but again that's

363
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,350
something I'm curious as to what you

364
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,260
think are these old games Nintendo does

365
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,060
monetize them from time to time do you

366
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,080
feel like that's stealing from nintendo

367
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,270
or not and and since we do know there is

368
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,220
a gray area with roms I'm curious as to

369
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,839
what you think about that as well I will

370
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,730
say I own a lot of Nintendo games that

371
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,779
have either purchased throughout the

372
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,100
years they're still at or in possession

373
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,230
of I don't mind emulating them I don't

374
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,420
know if you do I certainly don't all

375
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,560
