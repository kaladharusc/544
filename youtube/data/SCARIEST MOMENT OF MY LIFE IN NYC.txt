1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,730
he was a terrific guy

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,300
exactly the person you thought he was

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,300
mmm

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,270
yeah

5
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,010
feel selfish hello and welcome to this very special edition episode of the

6
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,140
block we are about one month away from the four-year anniversary of Hurricane

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,860
sandy the worst hurricane to hit New York City and today's episode gonna be

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,220
about my experience during that night where I show all this produces I've

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,760
never really shown before of lower Manhattan New York City completely

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:03,879
underwater a little refresher october twenty night 2012 hurricane sandy hit

11
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,259
New York City now this was the second costliest hurricane in US history never

12
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:11,050
left a path of destruction all the way up the East Coast but on the

13
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,780
twenty-ninth hit New York City now I was here at the time I lived in these

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,670
village and we knew his stomach

15
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,720
the forecast for a large and dangerous storm surge is the same as it was this

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,220
morning and they'll warn the whole city they prepared us for absolute apocalypse

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,510
and then like nothing happened

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,790
tell me what you really think all right tell me think about this storms all

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,880
right because our tickets right there was rain and a little bit of wind but

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,820
this is New York City like we can handle it then towards the end of the day I was

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,530
riding my bike back downtown on the west side highway and i watch the river just

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,380
keep going up and up and up and up

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,220
ultimately getting towards the southern tip of the island and I remember this

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,370
detail vividly the southern tip the island means like it's where you can see

25
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,310
all the water and the Statue of Liberty so it's where all the news crews were

26
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,740
set up with their big lights and their cameras and there's this one . when the

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,060
water came up over the side box that i watched all the news crews pack up their

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,080
stuff pack up their van shut down their lights for the cameras an event in

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
takeoff

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,489
and they were all saying it's not safe to be down here

31
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,840
it definitely was not safe to be down there but this is a slightly younger

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,439
slightly stoopid version of me was also with my younger brother who had just

33
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,890
gotten out of the military who convinced me that is like superior military

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,470
survival training would keep us safe and then my equally reckless hockey player

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,349
friend sean avery was with that lots of watches and at that point as the cameras

36
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:06,739
abandoned southern Manhattan we don't fit now when I say we do then I don't

37
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,819
mean that as a figure of speech i mean that well almost literally the water

38
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,819
started coming up faster than we could have ever imagined

39
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,890
definitely one of those situations where people use words like Serge you know

40
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,980
what does that mean in a few minutes later the water is an entire foot

41
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,650
now the middle of the city was higher ground and it wasn't wet but the edges

42
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,280
the edges were closest to the water that's where on bikes

43
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,780
there was a moment when we saw a guy a delivery driver and his car was stuck

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,040
whatever do

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,640
that was the only that was the only touching moment of the night

46
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,660
mmm

47
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,990
you can leave him

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,980
this was like a fancy bank building and you can see the atms right there and you

49
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,430
can also see the people who work in that building at the top of the escalator

50
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,560
now i have reviewed this for dinner while but can you imagine being trapped

51
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,699
in that building in seeing three guys on bikes in waist-deep water come up the

52
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,699
window

53
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,500
yeah

54
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,399
this is South Street Seaport this is where there are a lot of tall buildings

55
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,080
banks things like that

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
this is the most shocking part of the night

57
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:51,610
the water was literally at times chest-deep like this and there were no

58
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,270
emergency personnel anywhere no cops no firemen there was there nothing

59
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:11,340
powered out in parts of the city we could see the fire engines alt but we

60
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,340
were also very very alone

61
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:31,230
this is the West Side Highway this is an eight-lane Highway it was completely

62
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,230
under water from one side to the other

63
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
yeah

64
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,679
remember we got this fancier neighborhood in lower Manhattan and

65
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,919
there was a car under water there are a lot of cars under water but there was

66
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,499
one car underwater with flashing headlights it was a Bentley

67
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:14,319
this is like a couple hundred thousand dollar car and somebody had left it out

68
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,319
and it was submerged underwater well

69
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,849
yeah

70
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,569
who has a bentley and leaves it out in one of the worst hurricanes in new york

71
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,569
city's history

72
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,950
yeah

73
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,900
yeah

74
00:07:53,969 --> 00:08:06,209
good luck all right around midnight I said goodbye my little brother I said

75
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,889
your body Sean and my plan was to come here to the studio and edit this video

76
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,969
like it was yesterday I remember riding my bike down Broadway one of the busiest

77
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,110
streets in new york city in all the power on the west side of the street was

78
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,499
out one side of the street pitch-black the other side was still lit the other

79
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,079
side stored power and that's where my office was a couple blocks from my

80
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,029
office on my bike and all the sudden like all the lights on this side of the

81
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,209
street went out in that same moment for the first time ever my phone got the

82
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,889
emergency alert and i traveled to read it said get indoors in that moment for

83
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,180
me was sheer terror

84
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,740
it was dead silent it was pitch-black I was completely alone in this city I've

85
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,850
never felt so vulnerable is weird because the first time ever including up

86
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,439
until now first time ever i've been completely alone in New York City in the

87
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:57,120
absolute darkness by flashlight was the only source of light that was a moment

88
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
of absolute terror for me

89
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,059
cannons that were married yet but I said on the mission to go find her and on my

90
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:15,600
way to her apartment i saw a large group of people gathered around this building

91
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,509
I wouldn't check it out the entire facade the entire front of this building

92
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,509
had collapsed

93
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:45,250
that was my last experience of the night that's what i said this I was found

94
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:55,690
Candice and sort of hung up my camera for the night if there's an epilogue

95
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,250
this movie would be that I was in fact the only one to get that footage and

96
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,860
because of that there are a lot of companies that wanted it so i ended up

97
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,890
licensing the footage to HBO weather channel national Geographics all the

98
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,150
news people and I took all that money from licensing this footage and we

99
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,010
bought clothes and supplies and I've been donated them to the victims of the

100
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,850
hurricane

101
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,360
ok this concludes today's special presentation i hope you enjoyed it

102
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,310
yeah
