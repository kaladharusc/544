job Tron

2
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,450
Pokemon a-series dearly beloved by many

3
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,880
few games can claim to harness its

4
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,530
gravitational pole

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,720
this Golden Goose has sold millions upon

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,820
millions of copies spawn countless

7
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,440
varieties of merchandise and touched

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,420
multiple generations of kids and adults

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,140
alike

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,970
how many franchises do you know that

11
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,100
bridge the generational gap now know

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,940
what you're probably thinking to

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,470
yourself why you telling me this I

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,090
played them all I've been to a mall I'm

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,309
gonna Kanto Johto I'm sho habanero

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,290
poblano Antonio Banderas I swung them

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,650
all sister swung with the best but you

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,909
ain't never seen the likes of this

19
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,040
that's right with every big fish is a

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,110
leech on the belly today we're gonna

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,060
have a look at the fascinating world of

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,250
bootleg Pokemon games now these aren't

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,659
games you can find in stores they're

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,590
games that made their way into

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,030
circulation one way or another

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,050
none of them are licensed or

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,360
acknowledged by Nintendo and pretty damn

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,170
hard to find

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,120
first off let's look at what's known as

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,640
pocket monster it's inferred that it was

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,740
released in the year 2000 by DVS

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,110
electronics because on the box art there

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,240
are two small icons reading new game and

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,540
mm it's not empirical science but can I

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,369
tell you I'm a simple man it's strange

36
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,320
the label on my game says Pokemon

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,210
Pikachu edition which first off isn't

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,469
even the name of the game at hand but

39
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,420
you peel back the label there's another

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,880
label that says he could chew and it's

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,250
spelled wrong what is this game who made

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,310
it why look at his Pikachu seriously is

43
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,229
it any wonder why he's so popular

44
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,210
he's always half-assed and bootleg he

45
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,680
still melts my heart I can feel the

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,159
money loosening from my wallet already

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:18,939
he's like he's all like fuck you

48
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,670
all right I just I gotta leave okay

49
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,720
listen listen there's a lot to see in

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,010
this life not wastin it here well

51
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,900
there's a shocker for you five seconds

52
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,720
into the game and it's already like look

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,819
at his arms flailing even he's confused

54
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,569
and terrified

55
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,250
hey I'm not blaming him I would be to

56
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,500
listen to this music this is not level

57
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,010
one music talk about putting the player

58
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,690
on edge right away this game is

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,970
extremely hard to play when Pikachu

60
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,750
jumps the entire game lags every single

61
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,819
time but then when you just want to go

62
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,159
forward he speeds up like a power Walker

63
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,989
with a New York minute to spare so it's

64
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,370
like you're constantly in a battle

65
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,109
between game speeds thanks the

66
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,609
platforming real difficult right off the

67
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:05,060
bat

68
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,530
oh so can we take a minute to talk about

69
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,480
the fact that Pikachu has a face of a a

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,329
balding middle-aged man early Howard's

71
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,480
at you did you come back did you come

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,699
back from the ground mausoleum even more

73
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,079
ridiculous and all that is this walk

74
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,090
cycle I mean look at that thing coupled

75
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,410
with the music it's like a vaudeville

76
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,069
act in here maybe it really is curly

77
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,870
because I mean eight started as a

78
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,690
vaudeville act back in 1925 but that's

79
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,340
not that funny though cuz they're all

80
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,810
dead I thought they were supposed to be

81
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,349
funny

82
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,299
it's so bizarre seeing a Pokemon game

83
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,060
actually playing on mice nests wow this

84
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,739
games like a breath of fresh air because

85
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,599
it showcases all the Pokemon that we've

86
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,639
come to know and love over the years you

87
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,769
can see Beedrill porygon monkey mario

88
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,879
dinosaur ooh

89
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,739
abomination what is this is this what

90
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,690
happens when illicit Pokemon breeding

91
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,699
goes unchecked I'm looking at this from

92
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,560
every goddamn angle there is I can't

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,150
tell where it starts and where it ends

94
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,040
well it's got a pine cone for a body

95
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,349
it's all aware and a fez who's got that

96
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,139
one staring unblinking eye that reminds

97
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,370
you that this creature lives in

98
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,010
neverending ceaseless agony oh by the

99
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,810
way this game is pure bullshit you can

100
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,430
never see what's below you so you always

101
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,959
have to take leaps of faith that more

102
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,760
often than not lead to your untimely

103
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,530
demise and it doesn't even matter how

104
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,360
far you get there's no checkpoint

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,610
so if you die it's straight back to the

106
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,560
beginning when you drop back into the

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,900
game after a death unless you that's an

108
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,550
accurate representation are you saying

109
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,050
no don't put me back in please the

110
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,180
continue screen looks like a PSA for

111
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,460
abused Pokemon to me it's as if he's

112
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,349
laying there wounded in the light and a

113
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,360
pokeball rolls up to him and ash says

114
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,819
keep going Pikachu all rights back in

115
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:51,889
the ball for him no I don't want it so I

116
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,719
finally beat the first level bosses of

117
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,419
Snorlax pretty energetic for Snorlax

118
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,310
wouldn't you say so at the beginning of

119
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,669
level 2 you just see ash say it's hot oh

120
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,169
he's coming

121
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:11,240
now up areas okay

122
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,580
the orifice Oh bye it's hot he meant

123
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,930
literally it's a it's a it's a fire

124
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,550
level thanks for looking out for me ash

125
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,190
I really appreciate it Oh what is that

126
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,060
is that is that dancing crab demon sad

127
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,669
nightmare nightmare

128
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,590
strangely enough there's another snez

129
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,500
Pokemon game it's a port of Pokemon

130
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,360
Stadium for the n64 it looks like the

131
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,650
biggest difference being that there's a

132
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,410
predetermined roster of 12 Pokemon hmm

133
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,419
don't those names just look strikingly

134
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,169
familiar

135
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,820
who could forget SPEA and Daggett and

136
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:55,639
race it is a fully fledged game but

137
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,350
there's not much to say about it I'm

138
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,800
just baffled that it exists at all next

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,870
up is Pokemon adventure on the gameboy

140
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,430
color oh man

141
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,050
this one looks great it looks like a

142
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,729
game Nintendo actually could have made

143
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,010
let's do this I'm ready to go on this

144
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,620
balloon based adventure with Pikachu

145
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,760
whatwhat's hip up nope jump dip fuck

146
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Kenner's have a break tennis have one

147
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,169
break I'm not playing this up okay these

148
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,300
were my actual first moments with the

149
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,820
game complete confusion you know this

150
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,950
game sets up a certain special scenario

151
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,510
for you it says welcome to the game

152
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,090
that's the one thing you can see fuck

153
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,190
you this is clearly a platformer why is

154
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,590
the first enemy unkillable is this just

155
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,940
a way to condition me for the journey

156
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,680
ahead something you might notice is that

157
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,050
Pikachu jumps like Sonic he's even got

158
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,639
those super fast spinny feet when he

159
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,680
runs like in Sonic 2 okay and he even

160
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,680
charges up in a ball like sonic yes that

161
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,200
son that's sonic it's so it's Sonic it

162
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,729
turns out that this is actually a heck

163
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,770
of an existing hack for the Game Boy

164
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,250
Color called Sonic Adventure 7 what

165
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,770
happened what happened in 3 through 6 do

166
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,270
you even realize what this means

167
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,889
ladies and gentlemen we are playing what

168
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,780
could be the world's very first double

169
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,630
hatch

170
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,820
work John you are in danger of reaching

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,060
head capacity next one ups a bit weird

172
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,690
it's called mo Iman this one's weird I

173
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,830
don't know what to say about it it's

174
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,470
Pokemon with little girls I mean it's

175
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,930
very obvious that a lot of care and

176
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,090
passion went into making this I mean you

177
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,160
can actually tell which Pokemon is which

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,260
by looking at those beautifully crafted

179
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,640
sprites but why do you realize that for

180
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,930
this to happen someone had to sit down

181
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,790
look at Pokemon and say you know this is

182
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,290
great but it didn't ease more little

183
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,970
girls I'm gonna go downstairs to my

184
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,440
basement now next to my little girl

185
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,030
dungeon and program its game

186
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,290
welcome to Planet Earth ladies and

187
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,850
gentlemen the next two games I want to

188
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,070
talk about or Pokemon Diamond Dan Jade

189
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,260
huh I guess someone beat Nintendo to the

190
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,540
punch with Diamond there but oh this is

191
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,370
not the diamond version you're thinking

192
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,220
of because that would be a time machine

193
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,250
and I know you don't have any of those

194
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,950
laying around in this particular

195
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,570
instance we know diamond is better than

196
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,030
Jade because Jade has it and a gold

197
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,590
demon on the box and look at it just

198
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,360
look at the Isis I think there's feeling

199
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,670
behind those eyes feel little bit of a

200
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,070
chill sighting that was trying to make

201
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,770
me feel ghost I just want to point out

202
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,300
that at the beginning of this Pokemon

203
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,580
game there's an armadillo on a cell

204
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,320
phone I mean presumably just trying to

205
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,880
get reception in this forest cuz let's

206
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,380
face it it's not much reception out

207
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,620
there hold on a second fuck about

208
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,840
rocking out with your cock out I bet you

209
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,850
$50 that's the guy who made mo him on

210
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,280
back there that's mr. Maugham on this

211
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,260
game is taking something completely

212
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,270
fantastical the world of fantasy

213
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,100
monsters and bringing it down to the

214
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,530
most mundane level he's like did you

215
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,450
remember to pick up the baking soda so

216
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,770
this game has some weird fascination

217
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,110
with cellphones yet totally gets me in

218
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,870
the Pokemon spirit oh it's decide time

219
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,060
it's time to make substantial decisions

220
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,150
about my life and career oh wait never

221
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,560
mind literally just wants me to tell the

222
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,270
time I bet at this point you're all

223
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,170

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
Pokemon game well if that's what you

his preferred name elf monster

268
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,420

296
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,820
games starting to judge my lifestyle I

297
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,010

299
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,670
sleep late if I fucking want to fuck you

300
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,589
let's get back to the real games here

301
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,500
Pokemon 4 and 1 on the NES that's just

302
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,420
so weird to me a Pokemon game on a

303
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,880
console 10 years older than the original

304
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,529
game who thought this was a good idea

305
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,630
essentially what we've got here is just

306
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,220
a collection of mini-games based around

307
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,750
Pokemon three of which apparently

308
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,330
revolve around Micah the eating disorder

309
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,430
which causes people to ingest inedible

310
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,650
objects and speaking of food Pikachu

311
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,140
himself looks like a fucking potato pika

312
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,520
click pick a slot pika dancing pacman

313
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,980
that one is just called fucking pac-man

314
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,560
okay hold on no that is the only game

315
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,510
they had a P in it to begin with they

316
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,339
could have just as easily called it pika

317
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,290
man as all the others are themed with

318
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,959
pika but no they just left it pac-man

319
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,580
all right I'll give them the benefit of

320
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,080
the doubt maybe they didn't want the

321
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,540
subtlety of their blatant theft to be

322
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,730
lost on the masses pika click it's just

323
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,200
a game where you match blocks I don't

324
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,279
know what's going on with this one I

325
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,140
don't even know if you can lose ok click

326
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,910
click click fuck it I don't give a shit

327
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,980
pick a slot is stupid too it's just a

328
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,400
slot machine literally it's just luck

329
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,709
press the button and watch it go home

330
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,540
the only feedback you get from this game

331
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,940
is the wind box on the right pac-man ona

332
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,040
this one's good this one has some depth

333
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,630
to it probably because it's pac-man

334
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,550
literally it's pac-man and it changed

335
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,870
the course of the gaming market when it

336
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,150
came out because it's fucking pac-man

351

352
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,120
die instead of faint and I had that

353
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,649
version of lavender town that caused all

354
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,420
those Japanese kids to get mysteriously
