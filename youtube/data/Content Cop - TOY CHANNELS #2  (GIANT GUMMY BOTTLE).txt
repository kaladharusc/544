I do he said walk a little further he

12
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,580
can't drop his head and held him down

13
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:45,240
hold him down on today's episode of

14
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,369
content cop we're gonna examine some

15
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,470
repeat offenders I'm talking about the

16
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,289
toy channels last time we looked at the

17
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,909
toy channels they were mainly interested

18
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,429
in opening giant surprise eggs no

19
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,240
surprise here they still are a lot of

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
these toy channels would have you

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,450
believe that their content is about

22
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,030
education they're there to teach your

23
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,390
kids about colors letters and numbers

24
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,150
however it's not at all about education

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,000
it's simply about making more revenue if

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,160
you head on over to the awesome Disney

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,720
toys channel you'll find that they have

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
a lot of educational videos teaching

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,780
kids the exact same five colors rainbow

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,209
dash from My Little Pony is blue and

31
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,870
well obviously the sky is blue and blue

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,570
and yellow make green I don't have a

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,760
banana but I could cover you yellow

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,190
paint if the same color is a banana I

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,350
will not allow my child watching that

36
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,200
spongebob of garbage that will melt a

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,209
kid's brain in a second and don't get me

38
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,180
started on the Disney Channel smut have

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,799
you seen the way the girls dress on

40
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,230
those programs it is disgusting I

41
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,660
wouldn't much rather have my child watch

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,120
a bathtub with a baby inside getting

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,150
filled with Orbeez now that is a fucking

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,870
education I decided to title this

45
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,730
section visual herpes because I don't

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,459
feel like aids is contagious enough feel

47
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,230
like herpes is transmitted pretty easily

48
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,810
and the same can be said for this

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,790
garbage hey everyone

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,130
awesome video here and we're doing

51
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,130
something crazy today okay let's take a

52
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,690
break from splicing this gummy bottle

53
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,870
and do a little taste test mmm that's

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,500
pretty good

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,329
if you've seen one of these videos

56
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,250
you've seen them all they all start and

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,140
end the exact same fucking way

58
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,080
mix gelatin with a liquid and you create

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,580
a gummy bottle

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,110
what do I do now that I have this gummy

61
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,990
bottle should I eat it no because it

62
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,970
tastes like shit because we poured 50

63
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,280
packs of gelatin into the liquid maybe I

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,990
shouldn't be so harsh on awesome Disney

65
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,510
toys you know mmm maybe it takes a lot

66
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,280
of work to make a gummy bottle I don't

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,380
know I've never done it I think I should

68
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,630
really put myself in some awesome Disney

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,930
shoes before I go casting aspersions

70
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,550
their way hey everyone

71
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,860
Oh some Disney toys here and today we're

72
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,930
gonna do something crazy we're gonna

73
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,540
make a bleach gummy bottle first thing

74
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,820
we have to do is pour in the bleach

75
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,730
next up is the paint now we're gonna use

76
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,360
the gelatin I'm so excited

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,340
sit all together that was the really fun

78
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,920
part we're gonna pour the bleach back

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,870
into the bottle and let it cool in the

80
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,970
fridge overnight whoa it's incredible

81
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,770
it's not at all like the last one I did

82
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,890
oh this will make for a great thumbnail

83
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,170
the way I feel it open kinda looks like

84
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,880
mozzarella cheese as it stands right now

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,040
you have a lot of these toy channels

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,800
that had just flat-out disabled their

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,020
like dish to like bar because why would

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,700
they enable it you have all these people

89
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,190
giving their opinion that your channel

90
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,200
and your content is absolute shit

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,060
however you're you want to just keep

92
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,860
making that content because you're

93
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,930
getting views from little tiny children

94
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,090
it's just disappointing to type

95
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,610
spider-man in the search bar and have

96
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,590
shit like this show up I wanted to watch

97
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,690
the spider-man theatrical trailer I

98
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,190
didn't want to watch this cancer if you

99
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,130
haven't come across any of these

100
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,080
superhero videos on YouTube consider

101
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,890
yourself lucky

102
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,990
because they all play the same way it's

103
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,260
a silent film featuring grossly out of

104
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,110
shape superhero and a pregnant Elsa

105
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,159
it's hard to know what's a bigger

106
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,159
travesty the thumbnail the video itself

107
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:34,759
the title they use titles like Batman vs

108
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,069
spider-man vs Mickey Mouse armwrestling

109
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,310
/ giant surprise egg pregnant spider-man

110
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,050
I don't know when the fuck

111
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,330
spider-man becomes pregnant at this

112
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,729
point you've made me hate spider-man a

113
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,639
lot of these thumbnails you have visuals

114
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,590
of syringes now I don't I don't know the

115
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,690
significance of the syringes most of the

116
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,759
time pointed at the belly of the

117
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,979
pregnant Elsa pointed at the belly of a

118
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,560
pregnant spider-man pointed at the belly

119
