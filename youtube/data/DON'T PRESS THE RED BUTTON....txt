1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,160
So, welcome to

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,800
DON'T PUSH

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,300
THE

4
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,320
RED

5
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,060
BUTTON

6
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,740
*funny markimoo voice* If you remember...

7
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,740
...a game by the name of....

8
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,040
Don't Press the Button!!!

9
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,760
This might be similar

10
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,660
I don't know

11
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,480
This was... uhh... pretty newly released

12
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,320
and I saw it and I'm like,

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,300
&quot;I'm always down for a game that's about pushing a

14
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,620
big red button!

15
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,940
I like that a lot!&quot; :D

16
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,120
So I'm gonna push this BIG RED BUTTON

17
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,960
And I'm gonna see, what's going on with it...

18
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,360
I don't like ominous explodies in the background

19
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,040
The ominous explodies seem to suggest that something is going to be exploding

20
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,320
All over ME!

21
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,440
And I don't--

22
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,360
like that

23
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,380
*Clicking*

24
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,800
Let's see what happens!

25
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,060
WASD

26
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,600
Ok

27
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,320
Alright

28
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,800
Huhh.. Red mouse button to push-a BIG RED BUTTON!

29
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,920
Oooh

30
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,560
Push the red button! Push the red button! Wrong way *chuckling*

31
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,040
Red button! Push the RED button! PUSH the red button! PUSH...

32
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,060
PUSH BUTTON

33
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,920

Whoa!

48
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,660
What the- What the hell?

49
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,860
Travel to Spain!

Visit our website!

51
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,780
Okay

52
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,560
I WANT YOU TO PUSH THE RE- RED BUTTON

53
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,160
MY FAVORITE

54
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,140
Alright

55
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,280
WILL YOU PUSH THE BUTTON FOR ME?

56
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,440
PUSH THE BUTTON

57
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,940
BUTTON!

58
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,440
Alright

59
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Well, I think they might-

60
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,560
Ten out of ten doctors recommend pushing the red button..?

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,260
Anytime I hear that one of my friends HASN'T pushed the red button

62
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,040
I cut them out of my life immediately

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,060
I'm a millennial

64
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,340
And between all my snapchatting and Tumblr-

65
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
I thought that was Tumblr-SNIFFING at first

66
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,020
I just don't have time in my life-

67
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,300
Can you QUIET DOWN with the choir-

68
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,620
I just don't have time in my life for people who aren't socially conscious enough to push the button!

69
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,080
I mean, it's just the right thing to do

70
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,820
( Paid for by the foundation for a better red button )

71
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,480
Oh, man. I don't wanna do that-

72
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,440
TRAINERS HATE HIM!

73
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,300
Press the red button to learn the secret to quick muscle growth

74
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Uhh, I don't think that was his proper quote!

75
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,080
Red button.

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,820
Keep calm and push da button!

77
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,640
Anyone who'd push the red button is alright in my book.

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,520
Dermatologists hate her.

79
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,700
Age 51. She does not look like 21. She looks like a moist grandmother if I ever saw one.

80
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,580
Use this one weird trick to turn back time: Press the red button!

81
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,740
Ohhh!

82
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,500
Well you're not really putting a good argument out there.

83
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,020
I was so skeptical about pushing the red button, but now I've never been happier!

84
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,580
My skin is clear, my eyesight is better, I have an incredible amount of focus! And my love-- oh....life...whoa...

85
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,960
Level one complete, nice, you can now push the red button.

86
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,720
I cannot recommend pushing the button more, it's the best decision I've ever made!

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,780
I have three doctorates in theoretical science and all my data tells me that a logically minded person should absolutely push the red button!

88
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,920
The evidence is overwhelming, and anyone with a FIRM understanding and faith in science will not HESITATE to push the button at once.

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,300
Trust me. I'm like three doctors.

90
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,480
Oh...Well...uhm..uh

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,220
huh-OHHHH!

92
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,060
Wh- I don't like the way the button follows me.

93
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,100
* Best Button Pusher. Your name here *

94
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,480
Well, um...

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,980
uuhh...

96
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,480
BECOME WHO YOU ARE!

97
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,420
*through chuckles* Push the red button.

98
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,280
Whoa, who am I?

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
PUSH IT

100
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,160
umm

101
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,720
uh-oh

102
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,140
Well...

103
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,100
huh

104
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,240
I don't know, guys.

105
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,260
I don't know guys

106
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,820
Do you think I should push it?!?

107
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,800
I mean...

108
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,140
I haven't really heard a compelling argument that this button is gonna be GOOD for me

109
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,060
All I'm hearing is..that..that

110
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,840
...you know...

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,320
There's a lot of people that

112
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,840
BELIEVE

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
in the button, but

114
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,380
...you know

115
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
OBAMA here, he's just saying BUTTON

116
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,680
And I feel like that's a bit of a cop-out

117
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,120
I mean I don't even know if Chica would like me to push the button

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
To be honest, I feel a lot of peer pressure

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,720
and I don't think that's good for anybody

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,580
WHAT DO YOU THINK!?!

121
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,320
What do you think

122
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,360
Do you think I should...….

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,140
…………………..

124
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,800
♥ SMOOCH ♥

125
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,260
Whats that?

126
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,860
Huh?

127
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,960
Ooh, ohh, WHATS THAT?!?!?

128
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
ooohh

129
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
REALLY

130
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,540
You think that that's...that's like the

131
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,420
LIKE BUTTON

132
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,380
And you gotta smash it!

133
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,980
AS HARD AS YOU CAN!

134
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Wait..NO

135
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,680
WHAT'S THAT?

136
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,600
its RED

137
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,140
like the

138
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,480
DISLIKE BUTTON

139
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh no!

140
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,220
YOU DONT

141
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,420
SMASH THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO!

142
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,060
wait

143
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,200
whats that?

144
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,180
ohh

145
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,020
But you need to TRU-

146
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,000
Ohh

147
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I need to trust you

148
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I need to trust and understand that

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you know what's best for me, don't you?

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,220
Oh yes you do

151
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,580
Mark's hand: Oh yes I do!

152
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,000
*gasp* You can talk!!

153
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mark's left hand: BUT I CAN TALK TOO!!!

154
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh my God!

155
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Left: &quot;Don't push it!&quot;

156
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right: &quot;Push it!&quot;

157
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh my god!!

158
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
...

159
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,220
Who do I believe?

160
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,500
Who do I trust?

161
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,300
Who do I even approach?!

162
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,360
I don't know...

163
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm so torn between two lovers of mine

164
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,540
Whoa!

165
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,120
Health?!

166
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,380
oh, well

167
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,400
Ow.

168
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,680
I don't know what- ow!

169
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,400

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,120
Alright

180
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,740
I usually go with my gut!

181
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,360
I try not to follow my heart

182
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,980

183
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,760
O-kay

I guess Im not dying then, I guess its fine

185
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,720
Alright, so I'm caught between my gut

186
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640

Anybody else wanna chime in while I'm at it?

189
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,700
TOOTSIES, you got anything to say?

190
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,100
OH, always not there when I need you!

191
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,980
OH, the tootsies are outta commission

192
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,760
Okay

193
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,320
Oh my BUTT! Of course!

194
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Butt, what do you think?

195
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,220
[Inspirational music starts]
Butt: &quot;Listen, I've always known what's best for you, Mark&quot;

196
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,500
&quot;You've always trusted me and I've always had your back&quot;

197
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,600
&quot;No matter what, through thicc and thin&quot;

198
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,380
&quot;I've always been there for you&quot;

&quot;But we can't make this decision for you!&quot;

200
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,100
&quot;You gotta believe in yourself, you gotta stand by your convictions&quot;

201
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,280
&quot;And I'll ALWAYS, always be there to support you when you need me most.&quot;

202
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,940
Mark: Aw, thanks butt.

203
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,180
Man.

204
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,960
Butt really knows how to talk to me.

205
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,040
Butt really knows the best things tha-

206
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,000
MY PENIS! Oh, penis.

207

&quot;FUCK THAT BUTTON, FUCK IT&quot;

209
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,440
[Heavy metal stops]
Mark: No, I'm not gonna do that.

210
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
But uh, thank you.

211
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,280
(Reading the chat) 'My butt only says crap?'

212
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,100
HOW DARE YOU?!

213
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,860
HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT MY BUTT LIKE THAT?!

214
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,360
MY BUTT HAS BEEN WITH ME MY WHOLE LIFE!

215
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
And he's always been there!

216
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,700
When I need a seat!

217
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,620
My butt's GOT ME.

218
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,200
When I need to... open a door, when my hands are full

219
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
MY BUTT'S GOT ME.

220
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Don't you. Don't you dare.

221
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,580
Don't, don't

222
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,620
I'm disappointed in you.

223
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,500
I've never been more disappointed in you.

224
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,600
But I am.

225
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,640
So you know what, I'm not gonna push this button!

226
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,980
I'm gonna listen to my butt! And I'm gonna know, I'm gonna KNOW

227
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,660
Once and for TRUE

228
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,220
Once and FOR THE TRUE

229
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,540
That I listen to the right part of my body

230
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,820
And that's my butt.

231
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,960
(Reading chat)
My butt is NOT talking shit!

232
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,160
IT'S NOT!

233
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,980
NO!

234
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,700
ASS IS-

235
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,680
ASS IS NOT-

236
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,500
Well, my ass IS crazy

237
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,920
My ass is outta this world

238
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,160
My ass is in-sane, but

239
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
My butt knows what it's talking about.

240
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,660
I'm not gonna push this button.

241
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
Cos- BUTT-on

242
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,640
BUTT

243
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,460
That leads me to believe that the butt might know what the button

244
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Can do for me.

245
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,500
So I'm gonna listen to his advice, I'm gonna listen to MYSELF

246
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,220
All these other parts of my body, they don't know what's best for me.

247
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,120
But I know.

248
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
I know what's best for me.

'My butt is an arrogant liar'

250
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,440
Maybe YOU'RE an arrogant liar.

251
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,700
Maybe YOU.

252
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,060
I mean you ever think about that?!

253
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,040
Maybe YOU. Maybe you're an arrogant liar.

254
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,420
Maybe my butt, who ONLY TOLD ME TO BELIEVE IN MYSELF,

255
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,480
H- EVERYONE ELSE HERE HAD AN OPINION.

256

Everyone else *mock's his hand's conversation from earlier*

257
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,440
Everybody had an opinion.

258
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,780
Except for my feet. The tootsies were out of commision.

259
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,460
But my butt...

260
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,260
...my butt told me to believe.

261
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,840
In myself.

262
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,920
As a whole.

263
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,740
As one whole human being.

You can't- *sniffs* You know when your friends...

267
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
...have been there for you...

268
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,920
...from the very beginning,

269
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,520
and your friends...

270
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,660
...have supported you...

...through thicc and thin,

272
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,800
*sniffs* you gotta support them back!

'Cause if you don't...

274

There is a red button in the middle of the testing area.

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,460
It is required of you to push the red button.

Push the red button.

For the love of God, push the red button.

296
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,980
Why are you being so selfish?

297
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,760
It is so simple.

298
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,640
I need you to do this for me.

299
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,500
This is the last time I'm going to ask you.

300
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,080
Push the red button.

301
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm going to count to three and if you haven't pushed that button, so help me.

Oh you have to be kidding me.

308
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,600
What is wrong with you?

309
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,140
Can you understand me?

310
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,240
Push the button. Push it.

311
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,720
I don't think you understand me at all.

312
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,540
Push the button.

313
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,440
No. Nothing.

314
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,240
What a waste of time.&quot; *static noise*

Back to Mark: Wha-

316
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,420
Well I mean I was waiting for you to finish talking.

317
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,780
O...kay.

318
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,700
*stutters*

319
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,980
Well I mean like...

320
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,900
...you didn't give me a compelling reason like that was the thing like I was looking for a compelling reason. I'm a reasonable guy.

321
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,860
Like, I'm a reasonable guy. I would reasonably...

322
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,700
REASONABLY. I would reasonably push the button if you could just give me a compelling argument to do so.

323
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,700
I'm not- I'm not like a follower. I don't just do what the *stutters* the trends are.

324
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,560
I don't just do what people like, ask of me to do. I- I- I would do it though if you like- Do you have a pamphlet?

325
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,080
Like on the button?

326
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,340
Like do you have like uh, some information that I could look up on? That I could do some re- How long do you need uh, an answer? Like-

327
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,420
Can I get an answer back tomorrow on the button?

328
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,720
*gibberish* Alright well I guess he's gone, I- I guess he's not listening to me anymore.

329
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,360
But anyway. Yeah, so um. Yeah I- I'm not gonna push it.

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,100
I guess he's just gone. You guys want me to go through the language again?

332
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,080
I could probably do that.

333
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,540
DRUCKEN SIE DIE ROTE TASTE.

334
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,940
I don't know how to pronounce that.

335
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,880
Um.. Let's see there's a pie symbol in there and that's just intimidating.

336
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,220
There's a LAMDA I think.

337
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,220
um...

338
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:22,360
(Unsure of language)

339
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,380
all right I think so.

340
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,740
Where's the Korean on here? (here ya go!:idk korean ._.)

341
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,920
Why is there no Korean on here? (dunno)

342
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,220
You know...that's w- that's, that was what I was worried about. Okay, alright, okay. Alright I get it, that's what I was worried about. There's no Korean on here.

343
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,880
Did you know, that I'm half Korean?

344
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:54,660
See I didn't- I wasn't able to understand it is the thing I didn't understand what you want. I bet the Korean...the Korean translation... would really, really give me a compelling argument as to why I need to push that button but I just- it's not here the

345
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,040
Unfortunatley no.

346
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,420
At last ya I guess I- I guess we'll never know

347
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,180
We'll never know you'll never Know

348
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,380
I- I- I do like the lights though

349
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,720
Like if I had to admit like the theming of this room Oh is this like an escape room

350
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
OH I love escape rooms

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah I'm okay.  Yeah how you guys doing how are you good yeah you good, I'm sorry I haven't been paying attention a while I got distracted there's a

375
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,000
an awful- a lot of demands on my time as of late so I just don't know

376
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,360
what people want of me or what to do.. so uh.. *sniffs* yeah

377
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,680
I- uh- I did the fortnite thing. That was pretty cool

378
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,620
I met some cool people there

379
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,660
So that was nice

380
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:06,900
Yeah I lost. I lost. I lost really bad actually I uh I lost like the worst uh we- we did very poorly

381
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,720
um but that's okay I'm just sad that they didn't cut to me when I was building my subscribe to Markiplier sign

382
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,360
I- Joel and I, we had this plan. We had planned the second round, we were gonna build a big ol' sign that says

383
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,340
&quot;SUBSCRIBE TO MARKIPLIER!&quot;

384
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,000
But..

385
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,040
We landed ah- we landed where there were a lot of trees, the woods area. And uh.. we were trying to harvest, and I ran off to go get a gun just in case

386
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,980
And then when you know it, someone came up and shot Joel

387
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,440
I couldn't believe it. I- I just... I couldn't believe it!

388
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,300
I- I couldn't believe it. I- I just couldn't believe it. It was- It was something uh..

389
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,260
I- it was something like out of a nightmare. He- he got killed and then I had half the wood I needed

390
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,800
I was building &quot;Sub&quot; I got the number &quot;2&quot; in there I got  a &quot;M&quot; in there then, like, ran out of time

391
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,740
It was just a tragedy and then the didn't cut to us at all so they, uh

392
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,600
Yeah it was bad.

393
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,860
Oh yeah a storm killed me cause I was building- I was trying to build it and then the storm got me in the second round

394
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,420
Even- even, uh, Mosoke(?),  Mosoke tried to come help me, he was- he was uh, into this.

395
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,040
But then I think he was trying to- he was trying to a- cause I got the &quot;M&quot;

396
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,720
I got the &quot;M&quot;, I think he was trying to spell

397
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,220
Mosoke instead of Markiplier, I think he was trying to swoop in and get that from me

398
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,900
But, he didn't finish it either! He- he uh, he-he got killed by the storm as well, so, we were working together on that one *Click* We were working together, he was-

399
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,380
He was m-my buddy there, he was my buddy, but uh...

400
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,760
Yeah, alas they didn't

401
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,360
They didn't get us (x2)

402
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,880
It's almost like they didn't want to see us, it's almost like they didn't want to show us on camera for what we were doing

403
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,720
Is the room getting thinner? I don't know, is it losing weight?

404
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,280
I don't think so! I think just staring at the same thing for so long you start to-

405
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,980
You start to channel some uh, channel some  weird psychosis going on here, but uh, seems to be good so far

406
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,840
This's fun though! Like I gotta admit like, of all the games that I've played this is probably

407
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,780
This's probably the most ENJOYABLE experience that I had, this's is like &quot;Oof&quot; this's like &quot;yes&quot;

408
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:54,320
&quot;Yes&quot; I-I-I'm like &quot;YEAH&quot; I'm like REALLY excited about this one. The button makes me TALLER, well, you know, I'm comfortable with my height, I'm pretty good. I-I'm pretty okay with what I have. You know I-I-

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,840
Ooh, Oh, ooh (0.0)

410
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,580
Are you-are you-are you are you- AH! ARE YOU ON MY FACE? W- WHY ARE YOU ON MY FACE?

411
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,060
Like, UGH! Jeez, alright, that's a little rude

412
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,560
Alright I think you're listening to my DICK a little too much there, you don't need to be this assertive about things

413
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,040
I don't- EH, I don't like the- the- I don't like the im- okay, alright well

414
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,400
y'know this's real cool and all but the THROBBING is just what I don't like about it, it's just pulsating

415
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,020
In and out motion

416
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,140
I don't know, something very

417
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,720
Oof, just like oof I don't wanna deal with it preferably I'd really rather

418
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,180
oh- OH

419
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,580
Well thank you- thank you for respecting my  boundries, I really do aprecia-

420
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,440
Wait no it's- hang on!

421
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Wait, no, you- you're still in my face it just doesn't look like it

422
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,300
If I- If I were to click right now it would- it would push the button, and see that's just

423
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,900
that's just trickery, that's like a bad ad, that's like-

424
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
That's like someone

425
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,160
Eh like trying to &quot;coerce&quot; you into hitting a like button or something like that. That's- that's just not cool

426
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,680
Like come on, I mean there's all- I'm all for asking, the asking was nice and polite, but your tricking me!

427
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,300
You're trying to trick my and I don't- I don't- I don't appreciate that, not at all, I don't- I just- OH now you're gone, okay I called you out on your bullshit and now you're back to normal

428
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh I see how it is, oh okay, alright, well then,

429
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,040

Oaaoaoaoa

434
00:28:06,080 --> 00:39:19,240
Wheeyaminuuu

435
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,120
Right hand: You're a disgrace to the youtube community

436
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,080
Mark: Fuck you

437
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,600
Right Hand: Your content is outdated

438
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,760
Right hand: You were a mistake

439
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,320
Right hand: I'm embarrassed by the choices you make in games

440
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,880
Right hand: Your scrub-scribers are idiots

441
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:43,340
Right hand: and you're a complete bubble blowing baby

442
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:49,180
Right hand: Mark...

443
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,520
Right hand: As much of a complete goof as you are

444
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,340
Right hand: I love you

445
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,580
Right hand: But I need you to understand and respect my decision.

446
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Mark: Ok, I understand.

447
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Alright... uh, he doesn't want to do it, so

448
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,500
That's the end of the story. We're just not going to be able to do it

449
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,000
t-that's the end! alright, cool!

450
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
*clap* we're good, we found out, we got it

451
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,120
all understood

452
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,640
I think- I think we're in agreement, like

453
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,440
i've- i've really discovered a lot about myself and...

454
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,620
like the various parts of me

455
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,020
I... I get to know myself

456
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
and that's- that's important

457
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,660
I think that's really really important

458
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,860
this has been fun (x3)

459
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,840
I- I really have learned a lot... about this.

460
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
I think we've aLL learned, I think yOU GUYS have learned

461
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,300
I think aLL OF US HAVE learned something about themselves like...

462
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
in this whole time have you even THOUGHT about consulting

463
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
your various body parts?!

464
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,620
have you thought about *their opinions* on the matter

465
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,100
have you really *spoken* to yourself internally

466
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,920
hAVE YOU?!?!?

467
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
cause i doubt it!

468
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,740
like, i mean, i- i mean, hONESTLY

469
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,020
I wanna KNOW, I wanna KNOW these conversations that you have

470
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,880
so like, *record a conversation* of you *having the conversation*

471
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,940
a REAL honest, open-heart, conversation, with your heart

472
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,980
*high pitched* and really get to the POINT of the matter. get to know who you are as a peron, understand their wants, their needs, their desires...

473
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,560
They may fight...

474
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,980
on ocassion, but always remember

475
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,000
your BUTT knows best

476
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
your butt ALWAYS knows whats best

477
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
so listen to your butt

478
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
before you listen to your heart

479
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,960
and then listen to your gut

480
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
after you consult your left hand

481
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,000
and then maybe- maybe rely on your right hand

482
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
if your nips aren't speaking up too much

483
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,180
and your tootsies are actually... bringing their a-game

484
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,500
make sense?

485
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,580
It always does

486
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,180
feel free! go! right now!

487
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,800
speak to yourself

488
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
and learn what it means

489
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,040
to really be

490
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
