1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,310

11
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:32,560
when it's pushed out of this thing

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,560

18
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,700
long trip

19
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,209
it's a family thing Candace's grandmother passed away when you're a

20
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,069
ghost we go back in it

21
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,069
it's a family issues quick trip

22
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,010
we made it on the plane

23
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,950
we don't have the correct seats we're going to fit two people from their seats

24
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,690
no big deal

25
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,410
40 minutes later we are still sitting on the runway

26
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,890
they're not sure on how long

27
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,540
automated awesome to happen our Father

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,790
now but on the runway for over an hour having too much love it's you know

29
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,250
last we saw that three hour almost for our plan ahead of us

30
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,740

31
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,770
the baby is breaking out of Kansas is freaking out I'm freaking out

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,210
it's not just lose fault there's a I guess whether something we can't take

33
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,000
off

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,420
I mean this would suck generally but with the baby it really gonna have to go

35
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,910
back to the gate right here

36
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,270

37
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,840
we're back at the gate all hell has broken loose now

38
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,460
standing up the pilots

39
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,570

40
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,080

41
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080

we spent the whole day here at the airport well it was nobody's fault

59
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,180
I guess it's a nice way to say but we're not going to Texas

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,370

67
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,810
weather's fault it's not like there's anybody to blame you just sort of the

68
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,250
pitfalls of life at the end of the day we still had a fun day with the baby

69
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,120
running around eating junk food you know you could be worse

70
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,860
yeah

71
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:42,060
you know what I just realized Candace we went literally the entire day without

72
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,860
being outside except when we walk to and from the car the whole day

73
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,319
miserable human being and that can be outside at least some portion of my day

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,040
especially in this city

75
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:14,510
yeah

76
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,160
