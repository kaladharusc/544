to have two mummies and we have teens

85
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,049
that are split in two and we are going

86
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,239
to see who can make the most complete

87
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,519
mummy the quickest and the quickest team

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,829
will win we are going to try not to have

89
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,959
any skin showing and this is going to be

90
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,280
the big breakfast boys they're our

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,530
mummies are gonna be Jakob for I love

92
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,850
this team here and Ellis for that team

93
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,070
there and why are you keep posing Wyatt

94
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,260
I think that's races according to the

95
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,180
internet that's problematic

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:16,650
no four three two one mommy mommy daddy

97
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,110
all right and it looks like team bacon

98
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,210
it was starting off with the arms I

99
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,410
think they're working on the legs at the

100
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,330
same time team Reptar has started ahead

101
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,540
so it's a good somebody does something

102
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,760
which for the waist as well these are

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,450
going way better for team bacon now if

104
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,400
you feel like a team bacon is wasting a

105
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,020
little bit of toilet paper but when it

106
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,930
goes bailable is definitely getting the

107
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,510
arms almost entirely starting with the

108
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,780
face seems a little uncomfortable for k

109
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,620
Reptar but it seems to be working

110
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,960
oh my goodness now it's oh now it

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
definitely looks like tween rats are is

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,610
in the lead team bacon team bacon it's

113
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,980
your birthday it's your birthday you can

114
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,960
do it Oh Jacob how does this feel oh

115
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,780
this is I think I found my new fetish

116
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,230
Ellis clearly is now just moaning which

117
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,060
I don't know if that's fetishistic or

118
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,050
not but either way he seems to be

119
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,290
enjoying himself Oh now be careful team

120
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,900
Reptar there's definitely some skin

121
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,540
showing team bacon seems to be a cleaner

122
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:51,470
rap for sure

123
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,300
all right I may be the negative Reptar

124
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,590
have a little bit of an advantage

125
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:04,470
because he's a more human guys by the

126
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,000
way don't forget check these guys had a

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,370

131

doesn't matter we all win texting

132
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:26,590
mummies can't get texts that's untrue

133
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,490
[Music]

134
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,319
this is wrong my god I do think at this

135
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,669
point team Alex is ahead by a little bit

136
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:44,759
I am still seeing flesh very much oh my

137
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,289
goodness oh my goodness I'm definitely

138
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,150
still saying skin Jim I do I have to

139
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,830
tell you got to get his tail

140
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,900
you've got to get his braking you've got

141
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,289
to tell you oh my god it was like he

142
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:09,430
monetize do you monitor

143
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:21,979
do we have a home do we have a winner I

144
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,410
can't show Ellis on YouTube I will have

145
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:51,860
to censor that by the way guys don't

146
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,690
worry we will recycle this poop paper

147
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,660
because we've got a lot of treats that

148
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,770
we're gonna have the sports afterwards

149
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,360
or any is this don't worry

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,889
so the second game that we're gonna play

151
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,860
is the donut on a string game for kicks

152
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,650
we've got it on little fishing poles oh

153
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,990
yeah and we've got elastic strings and

154
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:16,840
cake doughnuts which no one likes anyway

155
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,940
eaters put their hands behind their back

156
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,680
they're not allowed to use their hands

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,210
to eat the donut they are only allowed

158
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,789
to use I guess their face because you

159
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,110
know you can if you want to get crafty

160
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,960
with it alright alright are you feeling

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,599
and we're going to basically determine

162
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,760
which one is the most honest most donut

163
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,229
yeah before they hit the floor because

164
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:44,110
they are before the floor you're out

165
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,030
alright so far Jacobs technique

166

177
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,290

178
00:09:34,290 --> 00:10:05,860
drama

179
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:16,080

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,690
correct

183
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,730
we got a trivia game jeopardy style

184
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,650
rules so we have two teams they'll pick

185
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,570
a category and a point value they'll get

186
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,130
their question they'll get a chance to

187
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,540
answer it correctly they get it wrong

188
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,970
that'll go to the other team for a

189
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,710
chance to steal if they get it wrong

190
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,050
that nobody gets any points whoever was

191
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,280
the last team to get a question right

192
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,110
gets to pick the next category we'll go

193
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,640
until we've exhausted all the questions

194
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,860
