1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,220
what is the worst pain that you've ever

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,790
been in in your life like honestly ask

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,200
yourself what is the worst pain that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,519
you've ever been in your life everyone's

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,349
been through pain like of some degree

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,690
some level like no one has had the worst

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,849
pain because there's always someone that

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,379
like the people in the medieval ages

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,270
when they've been in the iron maiden for

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,100
thirty days or the cow thing where they

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,130
get boiled alive the worst physical pain

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,099
I've ever been in in my life was after

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,560
my surgery and then to manage my pain

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,050
they had me in an epidural what it

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,059
epidural is it's a tap directly into

16
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,649
your spinal column at a certain vertebra

17
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,399
that injects a painkiller and anesthesia

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,020
directly into your spinal column so it

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,780
makes everything from that point down

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,000
numb so you can't feel a lot of it so I

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,180
had an epidural to manage that pain but

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,489
it was like it wasn't enough number one

23
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,739
right off the bat and then number two it

24
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,600
was making my legs numb so I couldn't

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
walk and that was a big problem so I

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,559
couldn't move at all I was like this

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,539
this is weird but okay I'll deal with it

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,949
I was gonna be bedridden for like two

29
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,199
weeks anyway in the hospital basically

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,700
the nurse and the doctors are like we'll

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,500
change this up like we want you to like

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,420
be able to walk and stuff so that they

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,369
changed my pain medication in the

34
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,860
epidural to something different cuz it's

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,330
just like a big bag in a machine that

36
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,729
slowly injects it overtime so they were

37
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,110
gonna change it so it increased the

38
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,450
painkiller and decrease the anesthesia

39
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,000
but there was a mistake in the in the

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,950
pharmacy and they decreased the

41
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,200
anesthesia and decreased the painkillers

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,810
so when they brought me the new bag I

43
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,360
was on no numbing agent and no

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640
painkiller it was like basically a

45
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,250
saline drip into my spine and so I

46
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,380
started telling the doctors that I was

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,450
in a lot of pain like a lot of pain and

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,220
nurses and doctors would keep coming in

49
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,869
and they would look at the Machine and

50
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,490
they'd be like no it's fine it's fine

51
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,799
look it's fine you've got no problems

52
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,060
with it it's totally fine it's giving

53
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,500
you medicine it's giving you medicine at

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,899
the rate that we wanted to give you and

55
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,880
there's no issues with it so what it

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,700
came down to was I started more and more

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,810
just being like Doc's nurse I am in

58
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,909
incredible unbelievable pain I have just

59
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,819
a huge gash in my abdomen that's not

60
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,920
being medicated at all it's like I got

61
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,770
stabbed with a six-inch so

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,500
it really fucking hurts and no one would

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,320
believe me no one not like the nurses

64
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,090
that I was with they kind of believed me

65
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,830
they kept going to the doctors but the

66
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,960
doctors did not believe me and it got to

67
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
the worst point where a doctor actually

68
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,330
came in the room he he was obviously

69
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,980
pissed off and just like to us guys just

70
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,690
trying to get more pain medication and

71
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,280
he comes in and I'm lying in the bed you

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,740
know I'm just in agony and he comes up

73
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,860
to me and he just grabs like full-on

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,100
grabs with his hand into my incision my

75
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,380
incision is from here to here like that

76
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,240
line that's the incision and he just

77
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,100
grabs around it and he starts feeling

78
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,810
for bleeding because he's like maybe

79
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,220
there's bleeding and he's feeling around

80
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,410
and he just grabs onto and I just start

81
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,750
screaming like just screaming in agony

82
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,670
because it is the most painful thing and

83
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,380
he gives me the most like like

84
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,540
derogatory look I've ever seen and I'm

85
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,090
just like I'm weeping tears it is just

86
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,340
the most agonizing thing he didn't do it

87
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,470
out of maliciousness now he did it

88
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,000
because he was checking for bleeding

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,520
obviously so he he was grabbing to feel

90
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,440
as if the incision was out like he was

91
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,239
he was palpating just to see if there

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,160
was something wrong with it and he might

93
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,630
have been doing it aggressively but then

94
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,860
again anything that he would have done

95
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,110
would have been incredibly painful and

96
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,900
so afterwards he left the room he

97
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,020
ordered that I needed to have valium cuz

98
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,860
he didn't want to give me more

99
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,120
painkillers but he wanted to give me

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,400
valium to like relax me and put me to

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,489
sleep and just like knock me out so for

102
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,440
those of you who know when I was doing

103
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
drunk minecraft sometimes when I would

104
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,880
get drunk and my face would flush like

105
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,830
with with blood I I would get this

106
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,560
splotchy mark on my neck like right here

107
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,560
and that's because that's a scar when

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,459
they gave me valium they they wanted me

109
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,230
to knock me out but I also had a central

110
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,110
line in my neck an arterial line in my

111
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,600
neck and what that is is it's a line

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,640
that ties in directly to your artery so

113
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,110
it can measure your heart rate blood

114
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,850
pressure and probably other things that

115
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,070
I don't know about but when I was on

116
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,840
valium and I don't remember doing this

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,810
at all I was so out of it that I dug

118
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,310
into my neck

119
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,070
I literally clawed and pulled and

120
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,650
scratched and scraped my neck until I

121
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,730
pulled the central line out of mine

122
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,060
and so I started bleeding incredibly and

123
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,980
then they rushed in they fixed me I

124
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,240
don't remember any of this

125
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,800
by the way I don't remember a thing of

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,990
this I don't remember doing it I don't

127
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,190
remember feeling it I don't remember

128
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,770
hurting like it all I remember is that

129
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,260
like when I when I finally came to I had

130
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,080
a huge like splotchy mark on my neck and

131
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,750
they were mad at me because I wasn't

132
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,630
supposed to do that so around that time

133
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,510
like I I was off the vet like I faded

134
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,910
out of the valium shit I was off the

135
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,120

136

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,810
and like I remember like I was crying

165
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,460
and even even this nurse like this a

166
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,020
nurse was broken up about this like this

167
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,910
nurse was literally crying and it's just

168
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,500
because the doctors didn't want to give

169
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,510
me anything else and it wasn't until

170
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,610
around morning when the shifts changed

171
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,620
and a new doctor came in that the

172
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,850
pharmacy realized that there was a

173
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,850
mistake the pharmacy said like a doctor

174
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,830
actually checked the prescription itself

175
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,360
with the pharmacy in the pharmacy was

176
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,910
like oh we dropped the anesthesia and

177
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,840
the painkiller

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,160
because I think it was when they were

179
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,810
gonna get a new bag like they were gonna

180
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,580
get a new bag of medicine and it was

181
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,990
supposed to be changed out and then they

182
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,210
were really like oh shit oh fuck oh fuck

183
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,620
and so after that it was an immediate

184
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,730
shift in tone like a work ethic

185
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,040
everything changed after that just to

186
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,290
put it in perspective of how drastically

187
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,690
it changed they they skipped out they

188
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,400
completely forgot about the epidural and

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,020
they just went straight to giving me

190
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,340
dilaudid

191
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,590
now dilaudid is also known as

192
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,370
hydromorphone it is it is a substance a

193
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,979
derivative of morphine that is 10 times

194
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,040
stronger than morphine and they gave me

195
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,820
dilaudid

196
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,060
every hour on the hour to manage my pain

197
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,970
that is how much painkiller I needed and

198
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,470
that's how much painkiller I would have

199
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,639
gone without and it was it was uh it was

200
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,050
better after that it was it was better

201
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,280
after that yeah it was it was much

202
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,100
better after that being on dilaudid was

203
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,850
very very very much better and so it was

204
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,960
from then on it was like this weird huge

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,640
state of being like I was just through

206
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,740
hell for 24 hours I was through hell and

207
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,140
I was in this weird moment where I

208
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,229
realized that was rock bottom yeah that

209
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,990
was rock bottom for me and so when when

210
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,400
I had that realization that that was

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
rock bottom it was kind of freeing I

212
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,300
realized like I had been through pain

213
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,280
unbelievable unbelievable pain that I'd

214
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,169
never experienced before in my entire

215
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,090
existence and yet I was still there and

216
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,639
I was fine and I was going to be fine

217
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,520
like I was I was through it and I was

218
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,210
gonna be fine

219
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,400
and and like I know that a lot of people

220
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,470
are you sure - sued or even my mom my

221
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,850
friends my family they were like you

222
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,860
should assume like I could've and I had

223
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,229
every legitimate reason to do that but

224
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,169
even then I was just like I don't want

225
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,909
to you know what I'm you know what I

226
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,599
mean like I don't want that to be the

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,520
defining thing about my life I don't

228
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,050
want to be I don't want that to be my

229
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,180
take away from it I didn't want anger

230
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,330
and revenge to be my takeaway from that

231
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,070
pained experience like it's not

232
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,750
something that I wanted to blame anyone

233
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,490
about I didn't want to blame myself I

234
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,899
didn't want to blame any of the doctors

235
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,640
like I didn't want a place fault on it

236
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,130
that wasn't my priority my priority was

237
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,620
after that I had this I had this like

238
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,459
clear clear intention that I needed to

239
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,770
do something with my life I needed to

240
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,080
make myself better I needed to take

241
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,970
control in some way shape or form

242
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,709
because I knew that life was always

243
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,540
gonna throw me curveballs and always

244
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,640
gonna knock me down and always gonna put

245
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
me through pain and I probably was gonna

246
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,390
be in more pain at some point in my life

247
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,790
that was even worse and like there have

248
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,140
been many people that have been through

249
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,360
worse pain than that and I have to keep

250
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,730
that in perspective to the goals that I

251
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,020
have to try to improve myself cuz I only

252
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,690
have control over my own life and even

253
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,149
that is up to debate like it's it's it's

254
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,620
something where I saw potential roads of

255
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,029
where I could have been I I saw

256
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,950
different paths that my life could have

257
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,750
taken and I saw different ways that I

258
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,029
could have lived my life and I chose the

259
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,760
one that allowed me to feel proud of who

260
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,680
I was as a person that that led me to

261
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,010
the road where I could believe that I

262
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,230
had some semblance of control of my own

263
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,480
destiny like forgetting the things that

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,760
aren't in my control not worrying about

265
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,709
the things that happened in the past

266
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,320
that knocked me down and moving forward

267
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
and always keeping my eyes on the

268
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,130
horizon to know that I can improve

269
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,760
myself until eventually I died it was

270
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,880
very freeing because I've been through

271
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,770
pain before I have I've been through a

272
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,220
lot of pain before I like as a kid you

273
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,260
guys probably know I had a jumping off

274
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,209
the top of the stairs contest with my

275
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,370
brother and I cracked my head open my

276
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,290
thick thick skull I cracked my head open

277
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,350
and it split and bled so much that it

278
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,940
feels like a whole bath foul with blood

279
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,180
my dad was one of those all of those

280
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,540
situations about

281
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,279
remember that being overly painful I

282
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,230
just got stitches and I remember being

283
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,240
in the doctor's office and my dad told

284
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,690
me about like I put the the like they

285
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,790
had this little like gown thing but it

286
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,620
had like a front bib so I turned it

287
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,600
around and I wore it as a cape and I was

288
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,089
just like ah superhero like it was I was

289
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,440
eight years old at the time but I was on

290
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,029
the doctors table I was like super your

291
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,389
dad and like he really remembered that

292
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,060
very fondly about me and it was like man

293
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,920
he's pretty tough and I was like yeah

294
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,589
and pretty tough and so um you know like

295
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,139
I I don't take away anything negative

296
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,790
about that experience or I don't even

297
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,560
remember me as a kid taking anything

298
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,389
negative from that experience and like

299
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,819
when I when I when I broke my arm later

300
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:35,519
on I was about maybe 13 or 12 it maybe I

301
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,709
was a younger like 12 or 11 let's say 11

302
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,709
I broke my arm I was with my brother and

303
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,660
we were playing a how far out the monkey

304
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,759
bars can you jump contest and I was

305
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,769
gonna win but I went out too far and I

306
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,860
fell and so I broke my arm and I broke

307
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,620
both bones in this arm and it was like a

308
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,769
stair-step like my arm went here and

309
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,470
then my hand was up here so it was this

310
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,540
is weird like thing so I remember

311
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,680
getting up from the ground and I don't

312
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,690
remember being in a lot of pain I

313
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,490
remember it hurt obviously I was like

314
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,410
something's wrong something's wrong with

315
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,990
my arm and so I like I don't even know

316
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,060
why I did it but my first instinct was

317
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,459
just to like that's not right I know

318
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,620
what it's supposed to look like so I'm

319
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,329
gonna fix it so I grabbed the broken

320
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,279
bone and I can die set it back into

321
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,800
place and then it started hurting that's

322
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,630
when it started hurting so I was like oh

323
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,000
[Music]

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,350
so like that's when it was like that

325
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,850
sickening pain where you feel like

326
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,680
you're gonna vomit like it was like that

327
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,720
was that was um the earliest moment in

328
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,139
my life when I was like that fucking her

329
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,250
real bad apparently I did a good job

330
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,319
because after that like my dad took me

331
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,110
to the hospital and the doctor said hey

332
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,720
you know yo you did a pretty good job

333
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
you almost got it perfect you almost got

334
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
it right it's just a little off here all

335
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,269
fixed up for you and then he immediately

336
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:57,029
broke my arm again to reset it back into

337
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:00,930
place and perfect and that's why I'm a

338
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,240
perfection but I don't remember any

339
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,730
negative takeaways about that

340
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,290
remember I remember afterwards I was we

341
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,870
went back home it was when we were

342
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,300
living in a very small place a downsize

343
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,510
from our childhood home because my mom

344
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,240
and dad got divorced and we had to move

345
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,279
obviously we couldn't like finance the

346
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,029
house anymore

347
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,040
and so we moved into this small town

348
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,839
home it wasn't bad in any in any way

349
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,980
shape or form but I remember going there

350
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,389
it was one of the first times where

351
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:30,740
there was like within the first month or

352
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,980
two and I was in my bed and like I know

353
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,110
the doctor wrote us a prescription but

354
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,910
most pharmacies were closed like there

355
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,350
wasn't really a 24-hour pharmacy in the

356
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,380
area and like I told my dad that I was

357
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,940
like I'm fine you don't have to go I can

358
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,500
wait until morning like I can sleep for

359
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,630
this you don't have to get painkillers

360
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,490
my dad was like are you sure and like he

361
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,320
said I went to bed I was like after I

362
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,029
closed the door and I went to bed and

363
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,790
I'm pretty sure I was probably crying in

364
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,029
my bed because like it hurt obviously

365
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,190
and I was crying in my bed and then my

366
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,839
dad just like opened up the door and I

367
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,790
was like this must have been like 10

368
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,800
seconds from when he closed it I closed

369
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,959
the door on him because he was like are

370
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,069
you sure you don't want me to get

371
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:18,829
painkillers and I'm like it's like but

372
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,870
then my dad just went out and got like

373
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,449
he drove like 40 some minutes away to a

374
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:25,519
pharmacy and I just remember the the two

375
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,010
hours until he got back I was like this

376
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,740
is never gonna end a gurney unbelievable

377
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,959
agony like oh it's the worst thing and

378
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,089
they came back and like I I think they

379
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,680
gave me like I don't know like something

380
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,260
like vicodin or something like that and

381
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,850
it was just like as a kid I've never had

382
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,010
anything like that before so it was my

383
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,389
first experience with painkillers I

384
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:50,120
don't like okay it's very very sleepy

385
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,339
and I just went to sleep like I I don't

386
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,760
remember any negative takeaways from it

387
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
I don't remember any negative takeaways

388
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,550
at all from it I remember being

389
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,899
frustrated because it was really hard to

390
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,000
like sharpen my pencil with my arm like

391
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,250
that cuz I can't turn the thing I

392
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,930
couldn't like get my books like out of

393
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,579
the locker but that kind of worked out

394
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,860
well because the some of my best friends

395
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,209
in high school and school in general

396
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,069
they became my friends because they saw

397
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,360
that I was having trouble with my broken

398
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,130
arm and they were like let me help you

399
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,960
with that and it was like oh that's

400
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,340
nice and then like I became friends with

401
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,660
a lot of people I think drew Thiel was

402
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,700
the first person that like really came

403
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,830
up to me from that and then I got into

404
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,420
band because of that and it was like no

405
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,610
that that wasn't that wasn't really so

406
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,620
bad I mean even if it didn't lead to me

407
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,270
gaining friends like that like I don't

408
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,580
think it would have been bad at all I

409
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,580
only got to this point because of the

410
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,380
trials and tribulations that I've been

411
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,530
through and even through my college

412
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,480
years like up until the point where I

413
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,010
had that surgery that I told you about

414
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,960
the tumor removal surgery that was in

415
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,170
2011 I believe and before that like I

416
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,510
was still not sure who I was even after

417
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,300
that I wasn't sure who I was like I

418
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,340
didn't really solidify myself as a

419
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,340
person until maybe a couple years ago

420
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,000
like maybe a few years ago like it was

421
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,530
it was hard very hard and honestly pain

422
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,630
was a big motivator for it pain was a

423
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,020
big like resolution for it pain was a

424
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,810
good way of encapsulating it but only

425
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,570
because of my attitude that I took away

426
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,500
from the pain there's and and and this

427
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,970
isn't doesn't apply to everybody of

428
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,290
course there's there's certain pains

429
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,240
that you know you can't just like I'm

430
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,770
gonna have a positive attitude about it

431
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,090
but it's not even like having a positive

432
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,190
attitude about it like when it comes to

433
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,890
pain I did I wasn't happy that I had

434
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,800
pain like when I when I burnt my hands

435
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
this is another point when I had a lot

436
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,120
of pain I was cooking chicken wings and

437
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,980
I was heating up the pot with the oil in

438
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,570
it and I had my thermometer in there and

439
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,180
the thermometer broke which was stupid

440
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,260
because the thermometer was supposed to

441
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,910
go up to like 800 degrees so mercury got

442
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,070
in the in the pot so I'm like fuck I

443
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,930
can't cook in this like Mercury's in

444
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,840
there that'll kill me so I stupidly put

445
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,730
it in the sink and I'm like I need to I

446
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,440
was gonna dump it and I'm like oh I

447
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,240
can't dump this down the drains that'll

448
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,040
be horrible it's so hot so I'll like

449
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,709
I'll cool it down first so I stupidly

450
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,800
elbow up the faucet dump water straight

451
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,070
into the 600 degree oil it instantly

452
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,339
flashes the oil bubbles over spills all

453
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,839
over my hands second and third-degree

454
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,060
burns all over my hands you can't see

455
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,250
the scars because I took real good care

456
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,830
of it but if I if it focuses right come

457
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,960
on focus right there you'll see just a

458
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,900
little scarring there

459
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,090
and stuff like that but I had second and

460
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,190
third degree burns on my hands so yeah

461
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,020
lesson to the wise don't put water on

462
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,080
grease don't put water in hot oil but I

463
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,180
was stupid it wasn't thinking just just

464
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,300
doing and so I remember I remember I ran

465
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,460
I I must have dropped it fell and

466
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,250
screamed cuz my brother was coming up

467
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,180
running the stairs

468
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,380
and he's like what happened and I

469
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,440
remember like I was sprinting to the

470
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,420
bathroom with my hands like in front of

471
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,570
my face I was like duh and then he was

472
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,010
up the stairs like what happened and I

473
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,080
remember running past him like Doppler

474
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,690
effect and everything just like just

475
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,160
like I was in the bathroom and I dunked

476
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,310
my hands underwater and it was so funny

477
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,750
at first cuz I was just like the

478
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,270
adrenaline was like oh and I was like oh

479
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,550
I'm fine like and then like I had my

480
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,100
hands under the water oh man Thomas I'm

481
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,130
so stupid like I put water in oil and

482
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,260
then the pain started coming and it was

483
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,330
like ooh and then it was it was weird

484
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,120
like like pulsating pain it would come

485
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,220
in like five second bursts and my hands

486
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,260
would cramp up for five seconds and then

487
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,570
release for five seconds it was very

488
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,820
rhythmic and very weird like and that's

489
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,500
when the pain would happen like the it

490
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,880
hurt like overall but then it would be

491
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,850
like and it would be like that cycle and

492
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,050
so my brother drove me to the hospital

493
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,200
and I was up at the emergency room

494
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,530
waiting camera only my hands and then

495
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,790
they're like please fill out this form

496
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,020
and I'm like right this was like please

497
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,700
just go over sit over there burn the

498
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,900
hands on like okay I want to walk around

499
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,240
because I hurt my hands just like I was

500
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,100
in so much agony like there were huge

501
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,710
boils on my hand like my hand was like

502
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,330
out to here with just this big boil

503
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,450
innocently and then finally some nurse

504
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,030
like behind the in the triage unit you

505
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,230
know the triage is like how they

506
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,030
prioritize people and the nurses like

507
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:32,490
get the fuck back and so like I I go

508
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,790
back to the you know the emergency room

509
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,110
little rooms there and they put me on a

510
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,320
table and then then they make the stupid

511
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,210
mistake of they put a blood pressure

512
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,800
cuff on my arm

513
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,020
and that's bad when you have pain in

514
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,070
your hand because the blood pressure

515
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,660
cuff it squeezes it cuts off circulation

516
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,240
and forces blood down into the hand so

517
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,890
is it like look it hurts girls real bad

518
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,920
this hurts this hurts my hands they

519
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,320
answered Herbert oh my heart's real bad

520
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,970
and so they they basically it wasn't

521
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,560
until an actual doctor came in that it

522
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,350
are just like just like saw this on my

523
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,180
arm saw me in pain saw the boys Emily

524
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,060
shit I remember the panic on her face I

525
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,070
distinctly remember the panic because

526
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,570
she's like you know she pulls a curtain

527
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,800
back you know the emergency room was

528
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,680
like Ali my arm or like Ali oh my

529
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,720
stomach or you know occasionally if

530
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,310
someone actually has a problem they're

531
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,440
rushed in on a gurney blood everywhere

532
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,570
and they're sprinting in so usually when

533
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,920
they pull back the curtain it's not like

534
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,410
a huh situation so she pulls back the

535
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:40,230
curtains is like oh shit cuz I had to be

536
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,760
ambulance over to another hospital

537
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,530
because the emergency room I went to

538
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,180
didn't have a burn ward

539
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,190
so I went to the the Cincinnati

540
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,970
Children's Hospital for the that burn

541
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,980
and it was it was just a fascinating

542
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,720
experience where I had never been in an

543
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,580
ambulance before I now had morphine so I

544
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,310
was fine and so I was like that's all

545
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,950
it's all good like you know I distinctly

546
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,360
remember like even that pain like that

547
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,360
pain was pretty up there like if anyone

548
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,070
asked me on a one to ten scale that was

549
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,260
a ten pain like that was if anyone asked

550
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,640
me at the time that was a ten pain I

551
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,900
didn't know that I was gonna have more

552
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,430
pain down my life but I was like that

553
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,790
was a ten pain but every pain up until

554
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,040
that point I would gladly say I would do

555
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,450
that again like I don't I don't care

556
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,470
like I would do that again not

557
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,410
voluntarily but if I had to like I know

558
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,880
I could go through that again and I'd be

559
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,220
fine like even there cuz I remember what

560
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,210
happened was my mom

561
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,620
finally got off work and she came over

562
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,820
to the hospital at the the other

563
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,500
hospital cuz I believe she was working

564
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,600
as a nurse at the time so she was nearby

565
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,610
in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital

566
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,050
just in a different department and so

567
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,790
she came over and she was like brought

568
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,380
me McDonald's and I remember like I

569
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,270
couldn't exactly hold it well but I

570
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,040
could hold it with like my rested on my

571
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,720
thumbs and hold them with my pinkies

572
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,100
because I had bandages up all I'm down

573
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,450
my arm now I remember I was just

574
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,740
watching TV and just munching on a

575
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,049
burger know what I ain't so bad

576
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,909
I mean really like that that was because

577
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:02,899
it's not so bad beep-boop nurse more

578
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,710
morphine please it's just like but what

579
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,840
sucked after that what sucked after that

580
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,769
was I would I they sent me home

581
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,360
obviously I had to go home it's not like

582
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,039
I needed to rest in the hospital they

583
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,570
kept me two days there just in case

584
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,009
they sent me home they send me home with

585
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:21,619
a big old batch of like a big tub of

586
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:24,200
bacitracin which is basically neosporin

587
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,840
and every day I had to change out my

588
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,580
bandages twice a day and they said it

589
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,989
was very important that I changed my

590
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:31,609
bandages twice a day for the healing

591
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,320
process or else like it would be heavily

592
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,759
scarred disfigured and stuff like that

593
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,379
and I was like fuck that shit

594
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:38,330
I don't want disfigured hands so I'm

595
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,249
gonna do this every fucking day so I did

596
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:43,549
and that hurt like a bitch because when

597
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:45,230
when you're when you're healing from a

598
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,149
burn wound like it's it's very important

599
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:50,330
to keep it like clean moist and well

600
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,489
like well bandaged so you know you don't

601
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:53,809
want air getting in there you don't want

602
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,749
anything like that so I would I would

603
00:22:56,749 --> 00:23:00,889
have to rip the bandages off because the

604
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:03,019
bandages would cling to the newly-formed

605
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,580
skin so every single day twice a day I

606
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,679
would have to rip the skin off of my

607
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,049
entire palm on both hands like this

608
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:14,659
entire section down to here there were

609
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,100
some burns up here I would rip the

610
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,330
bandage off and hope that the skin

611
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,619
wouldn't rip with it and it was like a

612
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,239
50/50 shot of whether it was or was not

613
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,190
going to happen so I'd rip it off

614
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,289
hurt like a motherfucker I had

615
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:25,850
painkillers obviously but you know it

616
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,559
still hurt I remember like 30 minutes

617
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,609
before I had to do it I would pop a

618
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,340
painkiller Billy and I would have to

619
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,470
mentally psych myself up to get ready to

620
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,139
do this and I was just like and then I

621
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:38,659
would put the bacitracin on I would like

622
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:40,009
make sure it's really well rubbed in

623
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,080
there I would put one layer of the the

624
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,999
topical bandage and then I would put the

625
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,889
gauze over that and I had these big

626
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,450
mummy hands I have a picture somewhere

627
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,249
of it but I don't remember where it is

628
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:50,749
one of my friends probably has it I

629
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:53,119
don't know it just never had any impact

630
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,049
on me as a person and me as like a human

631
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:58,399
being it was it was another experience

632
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:00,590
was like that sucked but I could do it

633
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,239
again like I could easily do it again

634
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,419
and it wasn't until you know I had my

635
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,029
tumor removed and I had pain beyond the

636
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,980
threshold that I knew I could tolerate

637
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,440
it was pain that forced me into a

638
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,830
mindset of desperation of just sheer

639
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,580
panic of not knowing if I was going to

640
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,190
even survive it like pain beyond pain

641
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,860
for longer than I ever could have

642
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,740
imagined myself tolerating that I had

643
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,610
this like realization that you know I am

644
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,500
very temporary I am unbelievably

645
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,440
temporary all of us are exceptionally

646
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,799
temporary we have very little control of

647
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,900
the forces around us we have less

648
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,190
control than we think we do and I could

649
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,250
have used that mindset to like really

650
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,049
like go into a pit of despair and

651
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,559
realize futility and like I could easily

652
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,210
see myself taking away futility from

653
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,910
that and going through this this this

654
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,590
experience and being like what's the

655
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,210
point like life is pain and stuff like

656
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,650
that but I didn't like because I didn't

657
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,020
like it completely disagreed with like

658
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,940
what I wanted out of out of life like

659
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,610
the the temporary nature of life really

660
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,750
really really was kind of freeing it was

661
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,190
it was it wasn't a bad thought it was a

662
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,290
negative at all it was a good thought it

663
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,150
was a good thought because if everything

664
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,130
was temporary then I only have a limited

665
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,410
amount of time to make a difference in

666
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,910
the world I only have a limited amount

667
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,980
of time to make a difference in myself I

668
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,520
only have so much time to be the person

669
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,020
that I want to be I only have so much

670
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,090
time to do the things that I want to do

671
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,100
I only have so much time to exist and

672
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,290
like the only thing that will be there

673
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,390
when I'm gone is what I've left behind

674
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,210
and I want to leave behind the best

675
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,950
things that I possibly can I want to

676
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,799
leave behind a trail of people that are

677
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,660
inspired by what I did I want to leave

678
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,270
behind the works that I've made I want

679
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,640
to leave behind the inspiration for

680
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,010
other people to strive harder than

681
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,679
they've ever striven before and to to go

682
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,120
farther than they ever thought they

683
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,040
could because I didn't think I could go

684
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,070
very far you know I thought I'd do well

685
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,809
I thought I'd be like okay but it wasn't

686
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:23,830
until that moment

687
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,250
the moment then I saw that things were

688
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,850
in my control not everything not

689
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,470
everything not everything can be in your

690
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,810
control very little things can but there

691
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,860
were some things that I could control

692
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,790
there were things that I could learn

693
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,500
there were things that I could practice

694
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,120
there were things that I could do things

695
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,580
that were within my realm of possibility

696
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,950
my potential the potential that you know

697
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,410
others saw in me you know I never

698
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,270
recognized and it was in that moment

699
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,010
that I saw the potential that I had in

700
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,500
myself you know I recognized that you

701
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,180
know people had said that I had a good

702
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,220
voice for a while and I was like maybe I

703
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,380
can do something with that you know my

704
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,090
brother was an artist sounds like maybe

705
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,340
there's some art potential in me you

706
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,430
know my my my inspirations I draw from

707
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,080
YouTube a lot I see that I'm like maybe

708
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,680
I can do that maybe I can do that it's

709
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,680
just like those simple ideas that simple

710
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,510
change of mindset even then I didn't

711
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,480
realize what it was and I didn't realize

712
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
where it was going to lead me all I

713
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,230
realized was that like maybe I can do

714
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:34,160
something maybe I can I don't know maybe

715
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,460
I could just show myself that I have

716
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,380
some potential and then I can act upon

717
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,780
it and then I can change my life and I

718
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,240
can improve where I am that's the entire

719
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,760
song of my life is just I'm going to try

720
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,120
and I'm going to try and I'm gonna fail

721
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,800
I'm gonna fail a lot I'm gonna fail a

722
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,240
lot but that's never gonna stop me

723
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,860
trying no one's ever gonna put me down

724
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,050
because no one's ever been through what

725
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,050
I've been through no one knows the pain

726
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,650
that I've been through and no one knows

727
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,070
how far I'm willing to go to do what I

728
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,340
want to do pain doesn't define you it's

729
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,080
how you respond to the pain that defines

730
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,150
you it's how you it's what you take away

731
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,400
from that that defines you it's it's how

732
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,620
you move forward in your life from pain

733
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,450
that defines you whether that's

734
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,590
emotional or physical I I don't believe

735
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,050
in the benefits of revenge I don't

736
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,110
believe that it leads to anything I I'm

737
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,070
a big

738
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,760
forgiveness and I which is odd because

739
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm a very spiteful person but not not

740
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,860
excessively like just about as much as

741
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,610
anybody else but it's just like pain

742
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,730
it's so easy to lay blame for pain it's

743
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,310
so easy to point fingers when pain

744
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,620
happens it's so easy to bone triggers

745
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,910
especially at yourself like you could

746
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,380
point fingers at yourself for pain and

747
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,540
and that's a self-destructive cycle all

748
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,190
of it is like it's it's a

749
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,830
self-destructive cycle it will never get

750
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,340
better if you're always seeking a

751
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,430
release for anger you know if anger is

752
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,800
your only release for pain then anger is

753
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,780
all that you'll have it's like a muscle

754
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,000
that you train you you'll only ever have

755
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,520
more of what you put out from it like

756
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,290
you have more control over it than you

757
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,400
think there are some things that you

758
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,320
don't have control over obviously like

759
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,580
I'm not saying depression is just

760
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,930
something that you can control it would

761
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,790
never say that but there are like

762
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,860
takeaways you can bring out of it you

763
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,360
don't even have to be positive about it

764
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,160
because I sure as shit wasn't positive

765
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,660
when I was coming out of those surgery I

766
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,060
was fucking angry I was fucking pissed

767
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,250
off but I wasn't pissed off at any one

768
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,500
person I wasn't pissed off at life I

769
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,480
wasn't pissed off at like things I was

770
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,190
pissed off that I didn't take chances I

771
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,140
was pissed off that I'd gotten to this

772
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,260
point without having done anything I was

773
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,480
pissed off because this could have been

774
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,040
the end of me that could have been the

775
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,170
end of me you know I'm not saying don't

776
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,270
come out of pain all smiling like yes

777
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,460
and more please like don't do that

778
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,870
that's fucking stupid

779
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,740
come out of it with a rationalization

780
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,010
that you don't need to point fingers all

781
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,620
you need to do is take the steps forward

782
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,040
that push you to what you want never let

783
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,830
anything be taken for granted don't let

784
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,810
any moment get away from you don't let a

785
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,760
single second get away from you because

786
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,120
I was nothing in my eyes I was nothing I

787
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,340
was I was just an average like everybody

788
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,710
like I had potential didn't act upon it

789
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,350
I was I was the sob story of wasted

790
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,390
potential you know and and a lot of

791
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,400
people you know can relate to that in

792
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,170
some way but I was ok with that

793
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,170
and a lot of people can be ok with that

794
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,630
and that's fine but

795
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,020
if you just take a moment to try and you

796
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,299
take a moment to go just a little bit

797
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,080
farther like absolutely anything's

798
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,760
possible

799
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,330
yeah no one is ever nothing I thought I

800
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,000
was nothing nothing
