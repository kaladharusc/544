1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,530
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,300
YouTube's boogie2988 coming at you lavas

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,740
get to the power of the Internet and

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,210
today I want to talk to you about the

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,670
pre-order sales for battlefield 5 and

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,080
why they're so anemic now you've

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,370
probably already heard about this if you

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,139
follow pretty much any YouTube gaming

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,570
channel or any gaming news website or

10
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,550
even read reddit a lot of people are

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,840
talking about this the fact that

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,300
battlefield 5s pre-orders are way lower

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
than black ops 4 and Red Dead Redemption

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,300
and I still celebrate anytime anybody

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,949
doesn't have pre-orders I wish nobody

16
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,179
pre-ordered it anymore

17
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,009
if you told me Red Dead Redemption had

18
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,800
zero pre-orders I would be so happy

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,570
about that because even though I know

20
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,040
that game is gonna be good even though I

21
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,950
trust Rockstar explicitly I still wish

22
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,719
people would wait for the reviews I

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,670
still wish people would wait to see if

24
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,809
the game is good before they bought

25
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,760
anything that's not the case here but

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,500
you know I mean anytime a game doesn't

27
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,760
get pre-orders I'm gonna celebrate that

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,800
of course I'm not chastising used

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,300
specifically for pre-ordering games

30
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,649
occasionally I pre-order a collector's

31
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,660
edition or I preorder a game that I've

32
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,820
got a demo of and got to play before the

33
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,199
problem is the way the entire industry

34
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,059
treats pre-orders in pre-order culture

35
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,589
whether it's you know you get it

36
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,080
incentivizes by separating out chunks of

37
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,580
the game or the fact that developers

38
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,590
will get bonuses based on pre-orders or

39
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,460
get fired

40
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,560
based on pre-orders I wish that wasn't

41
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,850
part of the industry it's this stupid

42
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,470
part of the industry and look there are

43
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,970
plenty of reasons the battlefield 5 is

44
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,290
not pre-ordering well probably the

45
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,060
biggest two of which are the two games

46
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,590
we've already mentioned Red Dead

47
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,810
Redemption 2 comes out a week after

48
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,509
battlefield 5 and call of duty black ops

49
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,759
4 comes off the week before and there's

50
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,290
a lot of people who will choose either

51
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,240
Call of Duty or battlefield because they

52
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,130
like shooters they're most likely gonna

53
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,450
choose the one that comes out the week

54
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,729
before that's just how that works but of

55
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,990
course you got the battlefield fans and

56
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,939
a lot of battlefield fans are going to

57
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,020
be hardcore about it they're better

58
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,490
pre-order the day that game got

59
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,840
announced and if you're one of those

60
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,890
people let me know in the comment

61
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,060
section below if you pre-order

62
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,280
battlefield 5 and why but even a good

63
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,689
number of battlefield oilless if you

64
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,070
check reddit if you check some of the

65
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,020
forums they're saying I'm waiting to

66
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,549
purchase this game maybe it's because

67
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,290
all the bugs that happen in battlefield

68
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,329
4 and how unplayable battlefield 4 was

69
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,040
when it launched maybe they just don't

70
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,899
trust EA right now maybe they just don't

71
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,430
trust the company or maybe it's one of

72
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,990
these controversies that's surrounded

73
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,610
battlefield 5 and we'll get into that in

74
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,959
a second and then there's the fact that

75
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,120
it's being published by EA and there's a

76
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,310
lot of people who have no

77
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,230
often in sandy anymore not the

78
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,400
stockholders because they're still

79
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,020
expecting ei to fleece everybody with

80
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,610
their sports games and to make a few

81
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,959
billion dollars this year from

82
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,180
microtransactions but the consumer right

83
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,980
now really is just frustrated after that

84
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,780
whole fiasco last year with loot boxes

85
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,489
and everything else it's our gaming

86
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,739
industry is just kind of upset and so if

87
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,450
there's an alternative game to play the

88
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,400
the battlefield a lot of casual players

89
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,170
are going to choose that is that but if

90
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,250
you watch a lot of these YouTube videos

91
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,200
and you read a lot of these articles a

92
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,580
lot of people point to one particular

93
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,890
controversy and that has to do with

94
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,230
women being in battlefield 5 and there's

95
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,480
a lot to say about that so I really want

96
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,010
to unpack it here so one of the

97
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,930
controversies involved female characters

98
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,390
being playable in the multiplayer for

99
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,790
Battlefield 5 the controversy here is

100
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,590
the fact that women were not very

101
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,660
commonly seen on the battlefield of

102
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,459
world war 2 now they certainly were if

103
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,049
you know your history at all and there's

104
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,670
been a lot of examples pointed out I'm

105
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,630
not gonna bring them up here in this

106
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,040
video but you want to search there's

107
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,540
plenty of women who did fight during

108
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,010
world war ii but a good number of

109
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,209
players felt that it shouldn't be

110
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,549
commonplace in the game that it

111
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,080
shouldn't be you know 50/50 split

112
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,430
between male and female characters and

113
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,900
the multiplayer just it's not something

114
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,880
you would expect to see and this

115
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,799
resulted in one of the developers over

116
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,380
there at dice the general manager oscar

117
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,959
Gabrielsson to basically tell players to

118
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,730
just get over it if you don't like it

119
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,079
and I find that to be fairly

120
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,630
antagonistic and so did a good number of

121
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,010
the players who normally would purchase

122
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,319
battlefield now my personal opinion

123
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,959
there's a much much better way to do

124
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,730
that I think you shouldn't be telling

125
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,130
people to get over anything I don't

126
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,870
think you should be antagonizing your

127
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,430
players at all I think you should have

128
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,200
any inviting your players to try your

129
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,180
game to play your game say that it's not

130
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,739
a big deal said that you might enjoy the

131
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,389
story of that we're telling you may

132
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:55,100
enjoy this aspect of the game we hope

133
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,930
that you give the game a fair chance I

134
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,609
think it's a much much better way to

135
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:01,040
treat your customer base dice doesn't

136
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,510
agree look there's plenty of people out

137
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,489
there who are not the target of that

138
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,840
kind of language when they're being told

139
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,310
to just get over it because most of us

140
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,590
don't really care whether or not this

141
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,120
game is historically accurate whether or

142
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,359
not

143
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,069
females are playable in the multiplayer

144
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,739
why would we care but empathy does allow

145
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,690
us to care about the gamers who are

146
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,820
being targeted about that who do care

147
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,039
about historical accuracy and who do not

148
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,140
want to be attacked or antagonized by

149
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,330
developers of a game that they are fans

150
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:26,780
of

151
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,030
that kind of thing puts people like me

152
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,850
off of purchasing your game politicizing

153
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,320
your game can put people off of

154
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,389
purchasing your game making this a

155
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,220
political statement rather than just a

156
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,850
video game

157
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,070
turns a lot of people off and that's

158
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,720
just the facts of it and then of course

159
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,430
there's this trailer and I chose this

160
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,590
particular screenshot because I think it

161
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,900
personifies the problem no not because

162
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,270
the character is female but having to do

163
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,550
more with like the prosthetic and in the

164
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,500
way that she uses the prosthetic in in

165
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,190
this trailer it just comes across as

166
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,540
it's not very good and if you take a

167
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,550
look at this reveal trailer you'll see

168
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,050
it's one of the most disliked videos on

169
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,370
all of YouTube with four hundred and

170
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,550
forty eight thousand dislikes across 12

171
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,500
million views it has more dislikes than

172
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,480
likes and and that's fairly uncommon on

173
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,700
YouTube especially for a big franchise

174
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,590
like this ensure there are people who

175
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,120
did not like the female being in that

176
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,950
game and more people who didn't like the

177
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,260
fact that she had a robotic arm or that

178
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,760
there were soldiers fighting with

179
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,500
katanas or just the fact that this was

180
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,870
an overall week trailer but this had a

181
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,690
lot of people heavily heavily disliking

182
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,250
this game but this trailer basically

183
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,360
confirmed what a lot of people were

184
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,380
afraid of that they were throwing

185
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,000
historical accuracy of world war two

186
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,430
completely out of the window in favor of

187
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,990
telling a narrative and there's nothing

188
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,400
wrong with telling a narrative in your

189
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,350
video game I play video games for their

190
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,419
narratives God of War horizon zero dawn

191
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,700
Tomb Raider I have no problem the female

192
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,080
lead either that's why I play video

193
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,820
games that reason I will not pick up

194
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,380
black ops force because it doesn't have

195
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,150
a single-player narrative and I'm not

196
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,200
interested in playing the game otherwise

197
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,570
but I do think the choice to politicize

198
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,060
your narrative to use it to push your

199
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,220
politics and then criticize the players

200
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,140
who don't agree with your politics in a

201
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,960
nation that split about 50/50 that's a

202
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,729
pretty big mistake and as the story got

203
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,039
told and retold on youtube and by the

204
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,530
media it got more and more politicized

205
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,630
to the point that EA eventually started

206
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,270
playing into that the media ignored the

207
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,260
fact that there were plenty of players

208
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,370
who were worried about historical

209
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,410
accuracy instead saying that they just

210
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,539
didn't understand history than that fact

211
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,700
that there were women fighting in world

212
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,890
war two but here's the thing that's not

213
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,630
what that trailer represented that

214
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,490
certainly did not represent the

215
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,710
historical accuracy of the actual women

216
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,720
who actually fought during World War two

217
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,490
I thought that very few of them had

218
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,560
robotic arms and all this came to a head

219
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,310
when Patrick's

220
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,840
and said that people lashing out against

221
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,700
women in the new battlefield trailer are

222
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,190
just uneducated people and that either

223
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,600
you accept that there are women of the

224
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,930
game or don't buy the game so it is any

225
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,670
surprise that this would play a role in

226
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,040
some people not buying the game three

227
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,310
years the media youtubers everyone has

228
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,070
been saying vote with your wallet let

229
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,960
your money and your credit card and your

230
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,300
pre-order and your purchase be your

231
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,250
voice and how people who seem to be

232
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,020
doing that and now everybody's lost

233
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,400
their mind because people are actually

234
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,460
listening weird and yes there's a lot of

235
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,870
different factors into why this game

236
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,640
would not be selling very well being

237
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,350
published by EE the stiff competition

238
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,840
the history the battlefield series all

239
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
that's going to play a role absolutely

240
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,470
but I think it's foolish to disregard

241
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,940
the fact that this game has been

242
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,370
politicized to disregard the fact that

243
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,170
there have been developers of this game

244
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,330
and publishes this game telling you not

245
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,550
to buy the game if you don't like the

246
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,530
fact that this game has been politicized

247
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,350
I mean come on how is that ever a good

248
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,150
strategy to tell people not to buy your

249
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,690
product

250
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,550
people won't and of course I undo

251
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,290
understand the sentiment of I don't care

252
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,480
if misogynists play my game or not in

253
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,370
fact I'd rather they didn't but here's

254
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,080
the thing I would be in the business of

255
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,720
creating allies not creating enemies I

256
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,340
would want to create a game that was

257
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,200
inviting to even the most misogynistic

258
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,330
person that would get them to play your

259
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,220
game that has a strong female lead that

260
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,230
they can empathize and sympathize with

261
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,890
Tomb Raider um horizon zero dawn do

262
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,120
these games ring a bell because they do

263
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,890
a really good job of that they also

264
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,420
happen to be two of the best selling

265
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,880
franchises the last five years hmm

266
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,370
interesting and what spawned all this

267
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,660
resurgence about this talk about

268
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,700
battlefield 5 is the fact that Patrick

269
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,050
Sutherland has now leaving EA slash dice

270
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,970
simply for whatever reasons but he's

271
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,740
leaving just before battlefield 5 comes

272
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,480
out and considering he's been the face

273
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,420
of that afield for quite some time yeah

274
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,740
you can connect the dots there pretty

275
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,390
easy so to clarify my statement here

276
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,710
there's a lot of different reasons the

277
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,990
battlefield 5 may fail and this is

278
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,460
certainly one of them and I think you

279
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,440
should not disregard it antagonizing

280
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,330
your player base even if it's a small

281
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,670
portion of your player base is never a

282
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,420
good decision

283
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,370
likewise politicizing your game might

284
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,470
very well split your piece of media in

285
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,720
half and it's very very important

286
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,699
to treat the people who may not disagree

287
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,379
with your politics that will be in that

288
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,779
game with respect with kindness with

289
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,839
love and empathy or know that you might

290
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,009
lose about half your cells in the

291
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,899
process but more importantly you should

292
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,699
never attack part of your player race

293
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,199
even if it's a small part of your player

294
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,029
base because they can often be very very

295
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,100
vocal and can affect people who would

296
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,480
never even hear about these

297
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,100
controversies and never even hear about

298
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,810
this stuff knowing that the media is

299
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,459
going to pick this up and put a spin on

300
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,800
it and and take over your marketing and

301
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,899
make it the marketing for your game even

302
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,060
if that wasn't your intention it's a

303
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,399
really bad decision just just don't do

304
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,470
that never tell your players don't buy

305
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,509
the game because you'll be surprised a

306
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,279
lot of them won't I will always

307
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,350
recommend the strategy of boiling the

308
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,990
Frog doing this subtly and kindly and

309
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,629
sweetly with love and empathy and

310
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,120
sympathy especially for the people you

311
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,709
disagree with especially for the people

312
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,329
who don't agree with you if you want

313
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,040
them to ever see eye-to-eye with you to

314
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,079
ever have a chance of winning those

315
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,790
people over you have to treat them like

316
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,370
I don't know people but if there's

317
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,629
anything in this video you can agree

318
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,459
with I do believe everything surrounding

319
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,069
battlefield 5 has been a comedy of

320
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,990
errors and it has been amazing to watch

321
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,939
and I'm curious if this will be another

322
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,620
titanfall 2 that was just poorly

323
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,079
marketed and it's an otherwise very good

324
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,610
game and should have been bought but

325
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,620
wasn't because of stupid stupid

326
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,449
decisions by made by the publisher and

327
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,129
in this case the developer I'm curious

328
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,329
as to what you think let me know in the

329
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:18,889
comments section below I know this is

330
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,329
going to be a very hot video notes gonna

331
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,100
be very controversial I know a lot of

332
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
people are not going to agree with what

333
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
I have to say here but you often tell me

334
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,350
I should pick an opinion and stick with

335
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,410
it and this is that and that opinion

336
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,600
very simple don't treat your customers

337
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,910
like crap we don't like it well that's

338
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,649
one man's opinion I know I could be

339
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,639
wrong and I know you'll let me know in

353
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,800
Francis what do you think about all this

354
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,490
stuff anyway

355
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,809
I don't even understand why anybody

356
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,000
would pre-order anything anyway anymore

357
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,290
you don't even know the game store to be

358
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,420
good okay I mean I use your pre-order

359
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,070
back when I have to stand in line a game

360
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,380
stop because you might run out of copies

361
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,040
okay

362
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,500
but you can't run out of digital copies

363
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,030
go home and a pre-order shouldn't get

364
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,680
the extra skin for my god

365
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,720
go get your crap okay wait to see if the

366
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,760
game is good wait to see if the game is

367
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,220
good I mean for God's sakes who cares

368
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,800
you missed all women in it I like women

369
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,000
there they're pretty
