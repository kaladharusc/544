00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,240
[Music]

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:10,260
[Laughter]

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,420
[Music]

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,840
[Music]

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,700
hey guys welcome to our review for DC

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:36,090
universes Titans the long awaited review

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,540
right all right even excitable mm-hmm

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,140
super excited right Alex super excited

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,809
okay this is as excited as I get right

10
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,880
so we're gonna give it a fair shake

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,840
obviously we made a ton of fun at this

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,720
series expense and rightfully so because

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,140
the trailers were awful using awful

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,379
stock effects using really crappy sound

15
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,210
effects that you could get for you know

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,380
$2 off of the audio store and yeah it

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,690
didn't come together very well and it

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,790
looks like it was going in the wrong

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,210
direction the sort of dark morose DC

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,810
Universe type of directions so we

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,600
watched I subbed to the DC Universe app

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,850
actually there's a 7 day free trial so I

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,020
signed up with that

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,899
it's $7.99 this service is gonna be

25
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,009
$7.99 a month ok and available right now

26
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,100
is episode 1 of the Teen Titans series

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,570
I'll tell you right away after watching

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,270
episode 1 we really need to watch the 3

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,060
episodes because this thing went by with

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,549
there's really not a whole lot here I

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,259
mean we're gonna do the review now but

32
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,850
maybe in the future our television

33
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,799
series should be like the first 3

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,750
episodes you guys think probably it's

35
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,240
it's pretty long still though 50 minutes

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,420
yeah 40 50 something like that but what

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm saying is in order to get the flavor

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,380
of a whole season of a show and to see

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,789
whether a show grabs you or not

40
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,649
sometimes a first episode is not

41
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,289
sufficient one of the main ones that I

42
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,150
use is true detective like it didn't get

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,710
interesting until you watch three

44
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,330
hippest sure but I mean the first one is

45
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,710
good enough to let me know if I would

46
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,680
just ignore it alright and so okay well

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,570
guys let us know in the comments what

48
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,520
you think is the better format because

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,900
obviously if it's the first three

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,640
episodes sometimes it has to be delayed

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,650
at least in the instance where they're

52
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,780
releasing them one episode at a time per

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,819
week and that's what we have here of

54
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,670
course why why don't they release them

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,240
all I want

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,020
cuz people pirate stuff yes and or you

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,550
could just watch the whole series during

58
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,070
the seven day free trial canceled right

59
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,170
after yeah so that's their way to keep

60
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,330
you subscribed over the next few weeks

61
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,060
and months in order to get your 790 but

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,970
once your little trial stuff and I'll

63
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:03,780
start mine and we can do boom alright so

64
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,910
maybe that's a little bit of hint of

65
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,130
what our opinion is on the service

66
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,290
itself but I am gonna first start with

67
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,080
the service itself to get that boring

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,110
stuff out of the way right so when I was

69
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,270
reviewing the app I was telling you the

70
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,890
movie selection is probably not gonna be

71
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,260
that great the comics selection are

72
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,700
gonna be limited you're gonna get an

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,830
entire series here and there but you're

74
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,570
also not gonna get all the new comics

75
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,550
you're not gonna get all that stuff

76
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,140
Netflix for comics now that is an

77
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,180
interesting fucking idea would you do

78
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,020
that if they were all brand new comics

79
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,850
yeah yeah I'm probably do it yeah but

80
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,040
that unfortunately isn't quite what this

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
is I look here of course you can get

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,750
pretty much all the Teen Titan comics

83
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,420
but as I go through the list here there

84
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,830
are obvious holes in the DC library some

85
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,690
of the popular syriza's aren't there

86
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,740
they want you to purchase them

87
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,050
physically I'm gonna make some money huh

88
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,990
yeah exactly it's action comics for

89
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,060
example you know doesn't have a whole

90
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,260
lot I think there's only like twenty

91
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,270
three of them and action comics has been

92
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,930
going on since 1939 so but the best

93
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,670
animated series of all time is on there

94
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,790
yes entirety so Batman the animated

95
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,520
series remastered in HD both seasons of

96
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,100
all 80 something episodes is on there

97
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,180
they have several television shows

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,350
movies right now there's only 32 total

99
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,350
and that doesn't actually even include a

100
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,960
lot of the animated you would think that

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,760
sure you maybe can't get the rights of

102
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,010
like you know Batman The Dark Knight

103
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,320
trilogy and stuff like that what they

104
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,340
have here is the Christopher Reeve

105
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,320
Superman they got Supergirl which is the

106
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,020
worst absolute worst movie that they do

107
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,240
have Dark Knight and Batman Begins but

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,160
it looks like that's all do the math

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,050
the phantasm and mr. freeze sub-zero are

110
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,120
on there yes they do have quite a few of

111
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,620
the animated ones but there's some

112
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,690
puzzling Lisa missing ones like Superman

113
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,700
Batman that series that I think they had

114
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,610
two films there yeah so so a lot of

115
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,130
things are missing right now and and so

116
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,960
in my opinion a lot of these movies you

117
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,640
can watch at other streaming services

118
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,220
and ones that are there are probably

119
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,530
things that you already own on DVD that

120
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,600
you've already seen multiple times so

121
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,330
that's not really adding a whole lot of

122
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,120
additional value right now so really in

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,990
the comics are yeah right so really

124
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,000
what's selling it is going to be the new

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,090
television series okay Teen Titans and

126
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,470
some of these other ones that they're

127
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,720
promising of course our Young Justice is

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
on here just as in vain Teen Titans okay

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,510
gotcha okay so go to going to the actual

130
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,030
Titans episodes here they're about 40

131
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,300
minutes each it's gonna be nine episodes

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,870
no it's going to be 11 episodes and you

133
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,410
can watch new episodes on Fridays the

134
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,120
next one is Hawk and Dove in three days

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,360
the first one was titled Titans and this

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,610
in the series premiere Rachel Roth a

137
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,280
teen haunted by dark visions and powers

138
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,590
falls under the wing of Detective Dick

139
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,980
Grayson we also meet coriander's and

140
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,580
Beast Boy gar Logan what did you guys

141
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,370
think let's jump right in into the first

142
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,890
episode what do you guys think I thought

143
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,960
that the person who designed the teaser

144
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,669
trailer and like all of the promotional

145
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,260
stuff for this should have to clean the

146
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,970
bathrooms of Comic Con with their tongue

147
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,140
they did a horrible job yes I mean this

148
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,810
was advertised so poorly I was ready to

149
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,580
tear this thing apart like it's gonna be

150
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,350
terrible looks horrible I liked it I

151
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,520
actually thought that this was a pretty

152
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,990
good series I don't know if I would

153
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,870
spend $1 for the just for this year's a

154
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,460
month but if I wanted to watch Batman

155
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,200
the Animated Series Plus this I could

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,570
see myself paying for it mmm surprising

157
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,960
yes I will also say that whoever put

158
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,470
together that trailer needs to be fired

159
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,750
sorry your talents could be utilized

160
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,700
elsewhere maybe you can learn how to

161
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,940
draw I don't know because it just it was

162
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,890
awful it really miss marketed the

163
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,610
television show there is still some some

164
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,530
problems with the series obviously we'll

165
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,050
get there but it's definitely not as bad

166
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,480
as we thought Joe what do you think I

167
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,950
really enjoyed it

168
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,520
Robin is my favorite so far I'm still

169
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,530
not sold about the other characters oh

170
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:37,760
yeah like which character Raven I don't

171
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,900
like her try acting

172
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,480
yeah I don't like her transformation Joe

173
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,420
the demons part of Raven her specialty

174
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,190
problem throughout the whole series with

175
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,840
like peaceful and everything because

176
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,270
majority their stuff is CGI and that is

177
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,390
lacking obviously look these boy look

178
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,130
really really bad some of the Raven

179
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,200
stuff wasn't I mean it's a TV series

180
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,430
right like they're not putting Game of

181
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,440
Thrones money into each episode and this

182
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,930
isn't this is like the best thing okay

183
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,790
so give it a little bit of an excuse

184
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,440
giving it a pass because like we look at

185
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,140
the budget like this isn't sci-fi

186
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,250
channel level stuff where you see like

187
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,630
velociraptors running around on this

188
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,430
like this is terrible it wasn't very

189
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,020
good but it wasn't it wasn't all that

190
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,330
bad but we only we only saw 10 seconds

191
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,760
of Beast Boy so maybe if we see the next

192
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,050
couple episodes and there's more of them

193
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,610
I'll be like nope this series is done

194
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,260
I had another problem with that what the

195
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,970
hell you're starting out with the

196
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,500
characters you got to show them off you

197
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,089
can't just show me Beast Boy one of my

198
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:40,280
favorites for like 10 seconds like well

199
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,409
it is only the first episode we've got

200
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,620
basically one small segment on each of

201
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,380
the four main characters now how many

202
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,270
members are in the Teen Titans oh five

203
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:58,010
and we have four here so cyborg is uh

204
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,830
sadly not here in the second episode I

205
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,839
think we're gonna meet Hawk and Dove who

206
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,710
are perhaps a replacement for cyborg and

207
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,650
then I think there's another one coming

208
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,589
the last a girl or something like that

209
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,000
we'll have to wait until see these other

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,650
episodes to see if another member joins

211
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,270
the party but as obvious

212
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,510
it's not going to be the original team

213
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,340
but I felt that the way they connected

214
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,700
the characters was pretty natural and

215
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,150
it's it appears that Dick Grayson is now

216
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,000
a police detective so I thought that was

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,860
pretty creative because you can have

218
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,170
some side plots there with it's like oh

219
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,270
is the is the police gonna find out that

220
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,250
he's you know doubling as a vigilante

221
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,420
who he really is he's sneaking it's very

222
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,130
intelligent he knows what's going on

223
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,770
because he can listen in on everything

224
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,930
and even worse mess with evidence if he

225
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,760
needs to because this motherfucker goes

226
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,340
out on the street and he's he's

227
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,590
basically taking his aggression out I

228
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,360
really like that seeing

229
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,100
destroying man

230
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,100
so we hate it in the trailer job but now

231
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,330
all of a sudden you're saying you liked

232
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,420
it I did he killed some people

233
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,310
yeah Alex I don't disagree completely I

234
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,110
don't think Robert should kill I think

235
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,990
the line fuck Batman was hella force

236
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,780
it's so super strange when you explain

237
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,600
that to things you haven't seen that

238
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,210
that it was not shot in the the trailer

239
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,010
the way it is in the series it's like Oh

240
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,480
where's Batman he doesn't yell fuck

241
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,810
Batman right then beat them up he

242
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,220
violently takes people out he paralyzes

243
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,010
a guy I'm sure he kills a couple people

244
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,290
and then at the various actually killed

245
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,100
people

246
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,950
okay see because I will say this in my

247
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,840
opinion you guys may disagree I thought

248
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,580
this fight scene was not filmed very

249
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,100
well now it wasn't you know the worst

250
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,750
thing I've ever seen on film but it's

251
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,970
nowhere near the levels of what Marvel

252
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,330
is doing in daredevil yeah it is it

253
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,880
looked bad to me I don't think the fight

254
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,100
choreography in this show is very good

255
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,620
so far I thought it's pretty acceptable

256
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,130
for TV is pretty good and very gruesome

257
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,070
yeah I think it's not TV

258
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,620
technically it's happy and Netflix in

259
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,090
the international market

260
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,860
you motherfuckers out there and

261
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,630
international or getting this on Netflix

262
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,150
so you know some people were saying well

263
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,590
I don't know like say they were using

264
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,680
VPNs so they could watch the goddamn sea

265
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,420
I had to go out and buy this damn thing

266
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,180
so thank me alright alright but I did

267
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,589
like to fight scene I think he did a lot

268
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:38,930
of it showed what they're gonna do with

269
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,300
Robin that it's not gonna be where he

270
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,890
punches people and then they just fall

271
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,020
asleep and like magically like Batman

272
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,370
does a couple times like he punches him

273
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,570
they fall down and they're expected to

274
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,180
stay down like he breaks a lot of limb

275
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,480
yeah and I agree and I agree with that

276
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,670
part of it I'm worried that it's just

277
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,649
gonna be this and then we're not gonna

278
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,959
see additional fight scenes with Robin

279
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,700
it's like this is what Robin does and

280
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,660
now it's all just like so I'm worried

281
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,730
about that if is this just a hook or

282
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,589
we're gonna see more of that but okay so

283
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,380
not not as poorly done as we thought so

284
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,089
he's a police detective and how does

285
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:19,279
that tie in to Raven basically Raven has

286
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,890
some kind of connection to him I don't

287
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,510
know she dreams about him yeah she's

288
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,600
been dreaming about it true dream about

289
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,880
him she says she was there when her pet

290
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,070
when his parents died the opening scene

291
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,360
is her going to bed and dreaming about

292
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,580
flying Grayson's and then she sees him

293
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,740
and she keeps seeing them die okay and

294
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,750
then whether it's on the astral plane or

295
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,610
whether she was actually there probably

296
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,110
more likely she's dreaming if she feels

297
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,360
like she was there yeah because there is

298
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,980
probably so eventually they meet each

299
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,390
other because she runs from her house

300
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,570
her mother is murdered by her mother

301
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,870
mother is murdered by a mysterious man

302
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,720
with motives that we don't really know

303
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,240
and because she's on the run she doesn't

304
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,860
run straight to the police to tell

305
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,900
people that her mother is dead she just

306
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,570
goes to a homeless shelter

307
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,790
she goes she gets all another bus and

308
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,110
then goes to Detroit Brandon then goes

309
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,430
without telling the police apparently

310
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,230
she cared enough about this mother she

311
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,029
says she loved her and then she got mad

312
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,850
she got so mad that demon comes out in

313
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,670
her and what does it deem ndu it pushes

314
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,029
the bad guy pushes him and then runs off

315
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,690
rob and had the demon right so I'm like

316
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,790
what the fuck you know I make Robin

317
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,010
brutal and they make the demon a little

318
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,029
bitch running she's 16 and she's never

319
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,500
done bad guys with guns okay so you're

320
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,010
saying she has much

321
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,200
greater control that demon inside of her

322
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,330
has a much greater control than any

323
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:54,090
other demon really okay anyway her

324
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,700
special effect on that is pretty bad

325
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,560
I'll counter Joe I liked I liked her she

326
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,570
does look like Raven to me it's just

327
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,360
when that special effect happens I hate

328
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,460
the way that thing looks it just looks

329
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,880
so bad it's so cheesy and I would I made

330
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,890
the comment at one point she is being

331
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,660
harassed by some kids on a school bus

332
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,760
because she's a freak and this guy wants

333
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,470
it you know try to have sex with her or

334
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,470
whatever and and another guy stands up

335
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,410
for the quarterback of the school I

336
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,140
guess stands up for but you know she

337
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,760
looks in the mirror after they call her

338
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,040
a slut and she calls you know the demon

339
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,960
calls her slut you know through the

340
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,700
mirror and it does a stupid effect you

341
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,680
can't help but laugh you know when I

342
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,660
thought it would be better if it's you

343
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,010
just don't see that you just see her

344
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,260
face and she's calling herself a slut

345
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,420
you know or you hear the voice in her

346
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,520
head and she's calling herself those

347
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,280
things like it's the the venom kind of

348
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,370
style where does she really know whether

349
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,960
there's a demon in her does she think

350
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,400
she's going crazy you could have played

351
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,230
with that a little bit instead of a

352
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,550
terrible special thing now of course

353
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,350
eventually you got to use some special

354
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,480
effects but hopefully they were there'll

355
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,980
be done a lot better than what we've

356
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,160
seen so far is what I'm hoping and in

357
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,320
the in the series isn't she you know

358
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,090
she's got a different look to a little

359
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,270
pale skin just I'm not really sure if

360
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,190
she's not a full power level and then

361
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,200
later on she'll she'll look like that

362
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,140
but what do you guys think of Starfire I

363
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,200
think that I was worried especially what

364
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,670
based on what we saw in the trailer and

365
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,380
however and how she looked and they

366
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,450
explained it perfectly yeah and it's

367
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,730
just now it makes sense now it looks

368
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,620
like it was taken out of context and

369
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,480
people were like oh my god she looks

370
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,700
like a hooker she looks like a freaking

371
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,620
prostitute how are you gonna do this to

372
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,210
my favorite character that is the

373
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,090
costume that you came up with her and

374
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,010
the explanation is she's the fucker

375
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,530
she's a prostitute yeah she is she's

376
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,900
actually a hooker prostitute but we

377
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,970
don't think that that's Starfire's

378
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,790
actual character she's like just a

379
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,710
prostitute and that's it right Joe I

380
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,830
hope

381
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,620
see yeah she just like go like takes

382
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,390
over her body but yeah it was definitely

383
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,340
she was definitely acting as a

384
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,840
prostitute that's why she's dressed like

385
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,810
that she wakes up in a damaged car with

386
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,150
some person dead in the driver's seat

387
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,550
and another car rolling up on a shooting

388
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,490
she's a she has no idea what this is all

389
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,440
about all she knows and that she's

390
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,050
gathered is these people whether they're

391
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,320
Russian mafia or something knows that

392
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,750
she was originally after this girl and

393
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,350
who's the girl Raven so that's how they

394
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,700
tie her eventually so we're gonna have a

395
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,190
journey of Starfire making her way to

396
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,650
finding Raven Raven has already been

397
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,280
linked to Dick Grayson Robin who seems

398
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,640
to be having pity on her and and they're

399
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
there kind of in similar situations

400
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,780
orphans just suck it isn't Teen Titans

401
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,120
and and so they have already got a

402
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,340
relationship Beast Boy though Jo go

403
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,290
ahead tell us why what to the face

404
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,650
basically he's stealing an xbox game and

405
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,010
you see him transform from a tiger to a

406
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,540
person why for ten seconds why you you

407
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,949
really want me to respond to that yeah

408
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,330
cuz he's Beast Boy joke of all things

409
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,230
doing stealing an xbox game you can

410
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,810
transform what would you want it

411
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,190
some stealthy pretty stealthy right he

412
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,690
was making so much noise oh yeah I think

413
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,460
it's one of those dumb TV things where

414
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,410
they're just trying to show some kind of

415
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,750
impressive animal and transformation I

416
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,730
don't for some kind of a comedy effect

417
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,940
but didn't work mm-hmm the CG effect not

418
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,650
very good it was an afterthought like we

419
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,120
see an entire episode and they're like

420
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,780
oh man we forgot Beast Boy he's robbing

421
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,520
a Best Buy it's like oh okay

422
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,660
okay and what did you guys think about

423
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,150
how it was filmed obviously the trailer

424
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,190
looked very cheap the sound effects were

425
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,100
very cheap the effects were very cheap

426
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,380
how did you think though the direction

427
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,580
and the cinematography was in the actual

428
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,630
the effects were cheap still but I think

429
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,430
it was film it was feeling pretty well I

430
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,780
didn't have a problem with there was

431
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,810
some parts to the like the direction

432
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,610
where all of a sudden the entire room

433
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,800
explodes but there happens to be like

434
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,310
this this fireproof picture this line

435
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,030
necessary for fires in danger at one

436
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,010
point of being shot somebody shoots her

437
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,530
that triggers her power because she has

438
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,450
amnesia and she realizes she has these

439
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,670
powers burns the entire room I don't

440
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,730
know Joe correct me if I'm wrong but

441
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,170
doesn't Starfire

442
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,300
not actually blow iron her dream it's a

443
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,290
green like yeah shorty too much green

444
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,490
with Beast Boy so they had to go

445
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,500
something else right so I guess they

446
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,030
were like ah fuck okay so we'll just

447
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,110
give her fire

448
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,600
so she burns an entire room and Joe made

449
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,960
a comment about yeah so you see the guys

450
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,070
gun like melted metal these guys clothes

451
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,410
is still pretty much intact

452
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,560
they blow away into ash but this picture

453
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,650
is indestructible pictures yeah looking

454
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,510
good so now she knows who she's after

455
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,930
and she's gonna go and go after Raven so

456
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,480
um surprise they're also doing a little

457
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,650
bit of a cop drama

458
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,170
Dick Grayson has a partner a female

459
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,590
partner who this possible love interest

460
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,590
interested in his backstory in Gotham

461
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,540
and what his other partner was they use

462
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,690
that in order to allude to Batman and

463
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,400
Batman being his other partner and hey

464
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,470
we just had a difference of opinion on

465
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,570
how things work out exactly what that

466
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,340
difference is we don't know yet I'm sure

467
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,240
that will be explored in future episodes

468
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,710
but we could see right now that just

469
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,620
Dick Grayson right now loves violence it

470
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,480
loves to just take it out Joe's a big

471
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,100
Nightwing fan I am I will say this I'm

472
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,110
actually pretty hooked on it okay I'm

473
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,580
willing to watch a couple more episodes

474
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,030
okay and I will say this is already

475
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,760
better than Iron Fist the first season

476
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:21,250
in the first episode whoa wow I guess

477
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,440
what I'm a green eye

478
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,450
really surprised guys this was a good

479
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,720
start not enough there I think to go on

480
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,000
obviously we want to probably get three

481
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,980
episodes yeah or was the whole thing

482
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,320
because it could fall on its face later

483
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,679
on but it does do enough that I think it

484
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:41,559
sets it up and makes you interested yeah

485
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,620
it's darker and and I was hoping for a

486
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,409
little more comedy as we go along yeah

487
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:49,750
we're missing some key characters in the

488
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,059
team but also it's an excuse to bring in

489
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,220
some new new characters and make this

490
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,379
something slightly different since we've

491
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:58,299
done Teen Titans three times in a row I

492
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,340
mean four times including the movie

493
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,649
we'll see something I just hope they

494
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:05,289
don't like too much like too many

495
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,149
characters all at once I want them just

496
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:10,929
to focus on the title or yeah and that

497
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:13,809
not bring in more characters yeah we are

498
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,779
always an advocate of simplicity and a

499
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,909
fewer number of characters because that

500
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,620
allows why because it allows you to

501
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,720
develop the characters more than the

502
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,570
relationships Alex do you think this did

503
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,950
enough to help you yeah I definitely

504
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,539
want to see more episodes there's some

505
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,100
things that I could see going wrong I I

506
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,659
don't necessarily agree that I want to

507
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,399
see more comedy like I'm fine with them

508
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,860
doing a darker heavy on the violence

509
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,539
let's figure out like where this thing

510
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,639
goes especially if they set up I mean we

511
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:40,720
already know that there's kind of like a

512
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,309
cult there's like that I got that

513
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,259
acolyte that was trying to kill Raven so

514
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,870
if they they grow that and that becomes

515
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,059
like a bat like a bad guy that I that I

516
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,980
like that I can that I like the way the

517
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,990
story is going I could see the effects

518
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,990
getting in the way of the enjoyment of

519
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,029
the series yeah I didn't mind the Raven

520
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,639
thing as much but Beast Boy and

521
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:02,169
everything we've seen in the trailer and

522
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,539
then if he's gonna be in this in this

523
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,149
series and he looks as bad as I mean

524
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,799
they probably showed us the best scene

525
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,779
of Beast Boy and this one to try to you

526
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:12,309
know put put your best face forward and

527
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:13,960
I that didn't look very good you're

528
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,759
right absolutely Beast Boy is gonna be

529
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,679
the weakest link here in terms of the

530
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,289
CGI Starfire when she started using her

531
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,419
powers and she glows orange and she's

532
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,490
got the green eyes I like that part but

533
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,080
the fact that she's got fire I hope we

534
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,269
eventually do see her actual powers like

535
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:29,590
plasma I'm not really sure if they're

536
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,299
gonna do the energy blast or if they've

537
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,840
read condor 2 just oh she's Starfire

538
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,330
well I would be fine if it was

539
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,450
maybe FlyFly you're fine with it and

540
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,450
yeah okay so what would we go ahead

541
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,309
let's go ahead and give this series some

542
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,649
final verdicts at least just off this

543
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,110
one episode not the series just episode

544
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,399
one and setting up the potential of the

545
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:55,620
series and you know showing off the

546
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,230
characters factor in CGI I also gotta

547
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,179
say I thought the soundtrack was

548
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,159
acceptable but there were a few really

549
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,039
cheesy tracks that completely distracted

550
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,380
you like some kind of synth piano not

551
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,769
really 80s but like cheap cheap Casio

552
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,860
like a little toy Casio thing that I

553
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,210
think took away from it anyway we're

554
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,860
gonna go ahead and start with Alex final

555
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,620
words I'm gonna give it an 8 I think

556
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,620
this this is is for it's not as good as

557
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,970
some of the Netflix ones

558
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,990
it definitely better than some of the

559
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,240
other ones like I think daredevil did a

560
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,010
really good job I like so far that we

561
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,600
didn't spend a lot of time going into

562
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,639
like we get that everyone's backstory

563
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:34,769
like all the DC movies do where we spend

564
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:36,149
so much time on where they came from

565
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,100
they give you enough of the character

566
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,269
and they're explaining it along the way

567
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,279
like you should so I think this is a

568
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,110
good start and if they can continue this

569
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,750
momentum or you build something to

570
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,740
continue on with it I think it can be

571
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,840
really successful series I'm thinking of

572
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,769
7

573
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:53,909
I'm not dating the graphics beast boy I

574
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,950
want to see more beast boy maybe not as

575
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,220
bad just something just something but

576
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,580
we'll see later on I didn't I didn't

577
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,190
really quite like Raven it's yeah Robin

578
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,559
is gonna be the best one right now for

579
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:10,889
me

580
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:14,250
yeah it's story pans out yeah it's very

581
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,019
surprising guys I think this is the

582
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,700
first time Alex is liking something

583
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,490
because I'm I'm a little bit different

584
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,870
than these guys I think it was a little

585
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,720
weaker debut than what I've seen now of

586
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,370
course in comparison to something like

587
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,799
the first episode of iron fist or the

588
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,200
overall you know season of iron fist

589
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,179
which by the way guys is now camped here

590
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,279
there is gonna be no season three I

591
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,659
thought they were axe well I know it's a

592
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,090
shocker right but like oh man but they

593
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,080
were kind of doing some interesting

594
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,029
stuff there towards the end of season 2

595
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:43,380
I think that's why some people were a

596
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,970
little upset because it was finding its

597
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,059
feet anyway but sighs the point I was a

598
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,950
little bit more disappointed I

599
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,500
like Joe agree that they got Raven half

600
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,380
right I hope her demon side can can be

601
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,269
built a little bit better those CGI

602
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,250
effects are gonna bother me and make me

603
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,200
laugh every time I see it instead of

604
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,690
sort of frighten me or heighten the

605
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,309
tension in the scene not necessarily

606
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,870
scare me but heighten the tension Raven

607
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,250
Starfire don't like this sort of change

608
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,639
in powers but I can accept that part and

609
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,649
Beast Boy at least in this episode I

610
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,909
remember we're just reviewing this

611
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,980
particular episode it seems like an

612
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,039
afterthought really bad CGI and he looks

613
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,840
like probably just gonna be used as a as

614
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,880
the jokester and the teen heartthrob

615
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,399
which is what he's supposed to be - the

616
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,230
teen heartthrob thing but you know he's

617
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,240
kind of they're gonna be the the heart

618
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,889
of the team the funny guy of the team

619
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,870
but from what we saw here very little

620
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,240
and we wanted more so and but what's

621
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,760
bringing it down for me a little bit of

622
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,220
the soundtrack a little distracting the

623
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,889
fight scenes not very good in my opinion

624
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:48,840
like when she walks through that door

625
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,570
and she sees this little flimsy little

626
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,460
fucking table I was like that thing is

627
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,380
getting destroyed and then she's walking

628
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,600
later on the guy flies I you know she's

629
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,220
fighting the guy punches and really

630
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,510
already flies across the room what does

631
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,120
he do it slams right that little piece

632
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,980
of shit think the only thing they can

633
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,470
break in the room on their budget so if

634
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,970
you can show this to the first episode

635
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,519
of daredevil daredevil Luke Cage Jessica

636
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,840
like you you're comparing it to their

637
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,760
whole series this as an episode is

638
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,260
better than the first episode of all of

639
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,940
those series in terms of action yeah by

640
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,669
far not even close like there was for

641
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:22,380
sure they hate fight scenes in this one

642
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,269
so it's hard because you have to

643
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:25,559
separate you can't say oh well the

644
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,539
action and daredevil through the series

645
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,559
of course is gonna be better because

646
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,299
they develop these things and they got

647
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,380
better and better and better

648
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,149
in the first episode this is the first

649
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,769
episode and so I think that the fight

650
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:36,779
scenes I mean that's why this one's an 8

651
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,340
for me and not something lower because

652
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,860
there they put a lot into this first one

653
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,600
but they have to keep this going they

654
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,159
can't just do the first one real big

655
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,840
help everyone pay 7 on the United

656
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,669
forgets to cancel like they have to keep

657
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,710
going with it you're absolutely right

658
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,260
and you almost convinced me there he

659
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,419
really did but I'm keeping it at 6 why

660
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,970
because I'm factoring in remember this

661
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,549
is not on television this is not on a

662
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:01,830
Netflix service where you get access to

663
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,600
iron fists

664
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,679
Jessica Jones daredevil and Luke Cage

665
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,679
and defenders and the service on the

666
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,559
whole but you want me to divorce it from

667
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,660
that and we're looking at it as like a

668
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,220
series in itself and you're not looking

669
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,419
at how much you're paying

670
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:19,710
I'll give you if you bring in the value

671
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,120
proposition what I pay seven bucks a

672
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,740
month for this series and just a series

673
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,900
probably not if you have access to it

674
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,669
because you're gonna watch Batman anime

675
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:28,140
serious and Justice League and use it

676
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,970
for the comics and it's something that's

677
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,070
tacked on I think this is better than

678
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,080
those other ones yes a Netflix is a way

679
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,730
better deal financially speaking but

680
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,710
just on its own this first episode is

681
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,090
better than all of those Netflix force

682
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,419
episodes okay so I I still keeping my

683
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,190
rating out of six because that's how I

684
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,710
feel about it right now I am incredibly

685
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,870
encouraged I did I thought it was going

686
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,100
to be like honestly I thought I was

687
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,720
gonna be like a three that's what I saw

688
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,450
oh yeah trailers but this is slightly

689
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,850
above average from me it is encouraging

690
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,770
these two gentlemen think it's even

691
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,929
above that it is actually pretty good

692
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,679
with their ratings so yeah we call it

693
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,419
like we see it we were wrong on the

694
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,039
trailer actually we weren't wrong

695
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,880
because the trailer shit was shit and it

696
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,400
did this thing a disservice we like what

697
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,230
we see so far we want to see some more

698
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,350
episodes but reason why I'm ending at

699
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,600
six is I you know at least in the u.s.

700
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,940
okay I'll give it a seven outside the US

701
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,669
because it's easier to get to it's less

702
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:28,470
work to get to less money that you pay

703
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,570
to get to because right now just one

704
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,539
simple show on this with a few comics

705
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,190
and some movies that you've already have

706
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,320
access to and you've already seen it's

707
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,990
just that value proposition is not 100

708
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,600
percent there because it is basically

709
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,570
gated behind this international is a

710
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,159
little bit easier to get to but for

711
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,850
right now once this series is complete

712
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,510
11 episodes if it is if it does end up

713
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,750
doing better than Iron Fist Luke Cage

714
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,030
Daredevil and Jessica Jones in terms of

715
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,740
watch ability and whether I like it or

716
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,140
not yeah you're really gonna potentially

717
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,270
have something really awesome here and

718
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,760
maybe make the DC Universe app worth

719
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,510
buying

720
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,390
but there's other options out there yes

721
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,790
Lee No okay and for you internationals

722
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,260
you lucky ass mofo

723
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,179
alright guys so surprisingly good and I

724
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,320
guess we'll do one more of these

725
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,230
episodes out at the end after we've seen

726
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,700
all of the episodes what do you guys

727
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,870
think or do you think we shouldn't even

728
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,790
need a midseason episode it's mid sounds

729
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,010
good because this can easily just kind

730
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,179
of fall off and let it get to the point

731
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,710
where it's not watchable and I would

732
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,990
like to be able to warn people that it

733
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,540
turned into garbage okay so it sounded

734
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,980
like this format see we're still

735
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,840
figuring out the format for television

736
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,970
is if we're just doing limited series

737
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,480
three episodes one at the beginning one

738
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,090
in the middle and one at the end but

739
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,770
first up looking at all the properties

740
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,840
the whole series every episode obviously

741
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,030
they're gonna bring the best okay

742
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,320
alright guys thank you so much for

743
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,260
watching if you want to stick around we

744
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,380
will have spoilers discussion I know we

745
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,210
mentioned some plot lines there we're

746
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,799
still trying to figure out where we

747
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,410
should go no spoilers or or spoilers and

748
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,500
in TV series reviews so stick around and

749
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,460
we're gonna have a little bit of

750
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,320
extended discussion at least you know

751
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,179
where we think the series is gonna go

752
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,280
and and what it might do alright guys

753
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,900
thank you so much for watching and we'll

754
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,540
see you on the next angry

755
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:42,180
[Music]

756
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,760
okay welcome to the spoilers discussion

757
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,370
this is what we do for movie reviews we

758
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,020
might change the name in the future for

759
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,480
television and make little segments out

760
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,850
of it but I did want to talk about where

761
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,460
we think this is gonna go I think

762
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,320
personally in season one they're not

763
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,840
gonna do anything too crazy it's just

764
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,910
basically going to be the team getting

765
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,860
together they're probably gonna drag

766
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,770
that out in terms of how long it takes

767
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,380
them to function as a team they might

768
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,420
get together initially and then just be

769
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,310
at each other's throats especially with

770
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,190
this darker more mature tone just have a

771
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,900
lot of conflict on the team then by the

772
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,790
end they are one complete unit and

773
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,890
they're ready for the next check form

774
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,320
you know if there's a unifying if

775
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,910
there's no big villain is what I'm

776
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,830
saying the villain here I think would

777
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,140
probably be that shadowy crappy

778
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,260
organization that was trying to murder

779
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,660
Raven hooch by the way might have a

780
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,700
point I mean Raven is basically the

781
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,690
Antichrist yeah right so that's kind of

782
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,180
an interesting angle but yeah so I think

783
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,010
that's probably going to be the main

784
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,960
villain that and maybe that wrote the

785
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Russians mobsters or whatever chasing

786
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,930
down Starfire and so they have to take

787
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,340
care of both of those factions what are

788
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,110
you guys thinking I think they need to

789
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,940
do something besides the Russians

790
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,280
because she just blew them up in like

791
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,870
one scene I think the baby do need

792
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,300
something more powerful at least do you

793
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,490
think guys that they're going to do a

794
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,680
super villain do you think Deathstroke

795
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,380
is gonna show up in season one no I

796
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,820
don't think so I mean if it is it

797
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,950
probably has to be something the first

798
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,050
six seven episodes you have to resolve

799
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,700
like the cult I mean any the cult things

800
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,110
just don't like that was there the guy

801
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,510
that died was the leader whole thing's

802
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,190
not they they're gonna tie that hardcore

803
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,140
into her well so as long as they resolve

804
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,420
that in the first half of the season and

805
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,680
then maybe that's like the mid-season

806
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,420
line then you can start introducing if

807
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,980
you have that unifying event brings them

808
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,390
together then you can present them with

809
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,120
like a bigger bad or bad guy to do

810
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,200
someone else I think there has been some

811
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,030
rumors and maybe maybe we might see

812
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,880
Deathstroke in the future so if we're

813
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,880
lucky we might see a Deathstroke and at

814
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,130
the end of the first last episode or

815
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,470
something like that

816
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,900
where somebody notices that this team is

817
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,450
coming together and they're just a bunch

818
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,090
of kids still so let's hire a mercenary

819
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,039
to take them out that'd be exciting I've

820
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,929
kind of curious to see how Hawk and Dove

821
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,850
if they're gonna be an important role

822
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,530
maybe just one episode what do you think

823
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,179
they're like you know the revolving door

824
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,280
like Hulk you know is it is it gonna be

825
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,230
serialized or is it going to be an

826
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,750
ongoing story thing this is still a DC

827
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,070
thing they could just you know shoot

828
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,179
themselves in the face like they

829
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:18,380
continued to do and they could just

830
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,940
introduce 40 different characters and I

831
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,380
don't care about any of them anymore and

832
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,640
then it just jumps off the cliff and

833
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,200
turns in the garbage but I'm hoping it's

834
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,240
short for short period of time they

835
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,460
provide something they go away not

836
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,750
forever they can come back another

837
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,490
episodes Vaughn I'm okay with having

838
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,919
them on the team permanently and I

839
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,510
haven't even seen them yet I do think

840
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,159
that the team needs some sort of dynamic

841
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,530
that we've not seen before because we've

842
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,330
seen a lot of the stories and the

843
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,429
cartoons of what their team dynamic is

844
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:45,289
without SCI board you need another

845
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,419
interesting angle now adding another

846
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:49,250
team member beyond that now you're gonna

847
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,840
have to I'm really questioning whether

848
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,850
Elastigirl or whatever

849
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,460
I've seen some cast names we haven't

850
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,039
gone ahead we weren't given most of most

851
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,840
of the reviews on here actually only

852
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,760
based on three episodes so I'm not

853
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,070
really sure how these critics can get be

854
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,990
fair to the series and give it an entire

855
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,149
season rating based off of three

856
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,909
episodes that seems unfair to me well

857
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,470
here's my thing I'm kind of nervous

858
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,050
about this because like I think if

859
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,300
you're gonna add two new characters

860
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,980
right off the back in your second

861
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,080
episode something's got to be happening

862
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,940
this should be like during the min it's

863
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,359
like focus on these four characters why

864
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,369
are you gonna mess something big happens

865
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:30,109
towards the end where they are doing

866
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,520
good like the power it should be like a

867
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,010
mid introduced them during the mid let

868
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,899
us get acquainted with these four are

869
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,760
they seems like they're blowing their

870
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,730
load really quick yeah these guys good

871
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,770
enough do you want to put more unless

872
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,089
they show up and like help them with

873
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:45,830
something really quickly and then they

874
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,020
might get back and then you recruit them

875
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,550
at the end for the you know the big

876
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,290
fight okay that's what Joe's hoping for

877
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,659
okay predictions let's do some

878
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,149
predictions and hold ourselves to these

879
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,660
kind of see who's who's right prediction

880
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Joe is Starfire gonna fly by the end of

881
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,190
the this season no she will not

882
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,849
I think I think she'll drink on it I bet

883
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:11,760
a drink no I would send that up all

884
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,450
right thanks hey I was in that uh she's

885
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,760
gonna hover and you think she's gonna

886
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,369
outright fly you know off the ground for

887
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,520
it let's a little bit okay with you you

888
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,839
know rape well who's gonna be first

889
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,109
Raven or Starfire who's gonna be first

890
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:32,940
to fly mmm good good awesome money hurt

891
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,819
herself or like the demon thing these

892
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:38,490
things pretty much already flown across

893
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,010
the room because Raven I think has

894
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,770
already won so Raven in my opinion but

895
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,150
okay is Dick Grayson going to kill

896
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,030
anybody else or was this just we need to

897
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,619
hook people so let's have him shoot a

898
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,960
bunch of people say kill a fuck back man

899
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,150
and then the rest of the series is him

900
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,550
discovering himself and maybe I really

901
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,640
shouldn't be mean to bad guys that's

902
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,190
what I think I think once it tied in

903
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,619
with just like Arabic you remember arrow

904
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,510
killing people and then like you don't

905
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,890
kill people no more I think he kills

906
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,599
people the whole way through not the

907
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,440
whole way through I think if there's

908
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,210
gonna be times in the next ten episodes

909
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,109
where people die at his hands like what

910
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:24,329
I said was he'll never kill anybody else

911
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,670
you think he will have at least some

912
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,589
more body count before he yeah it may

913
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,480
not be as violent as that one scene

914
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,890
where they're trying to get I mean I

915
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,200
know that it's they're trying to you

916
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,609
know butter us up with that one scene

917
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:36,510
and we're probably not gonna have

918
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,400
anything else like that big going

919
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,599
forward but I think he definitely

920
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,609
punches someone to the point where

921
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:43,859
they're dead they die okay what's going

922
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,020
on with Starfire jo do you think that

923
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,560
she is an alien or an alien entity has

924
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,020
taken over the body of a human female

925
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,880
who already had a criminal empire what

926
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,170
do you think is happening here or was

927
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,609
she an alien from the beginning and

928
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:01,980
Rosalee arranged it go she's an alien

929
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,329
from the get-go rose through the ranks

930
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:05,400
of this this criminal underworld and

931
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,510
then lost her memory she's I all right

932
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,970
and do you think what about you have no

933
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,530
idea no idea okay I'm gonna say that

934
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,210
she's an alien from the get-go she has

935
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,080
to be I mean look at what well in this

936
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,930
she did her powers if she was just using

937
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,090
a human vessel that she would explode

938
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,370
right we're going the possession angle

939
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,100
yeah not a thing for Starfire but we're

940
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,310
wondering maybe they're doing that here

941
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,520
because the way they've set her up next

942
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,220
prediction for Alex do you think that we

943
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,260
will see Starfire in her original

944
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,690
costume in some form by the end of the

945
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,580
season no I don't think so

946
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,540
I mean it's so hard to do that without

947
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,000
being over-the-top and cheesy it is

948
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,310
tough to do her costume I will say that

949
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:07,150
but I do think she loses the whole thing

950
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,860
yeah okay with the purple dress

951
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,690
one thing that I think I failed to

952
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,580
mention in the review that I wanted to

953
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,040
was the visuals I kicked it to you guys

954
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,050
but I need to talk a little bit more and

955
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,930
give my opinion on that is that noted

956
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,610
did you guys notice they were doing a

957
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:29,450
lot of subliminal visual formatting yes

958
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,610
visual foreshadowing of subliminal

959
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,070
theming when Starfire's walking around

960
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,860
there's a lot of blues and purples in

961
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,990
the club you should notice the lights

962
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,190
are blue and purple that could have been

963
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,230
any lights but it was blue and purple

964
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,390
when Beast Boy was around the background

965
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,030
all the televisions are a jungle a lot

966
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,190
of green there of course when Dick

967
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,930
Grayson is fighting that's where you've

968
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,270
got the monotones you've got the Batman

969
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,090
Gotham kind of look at night and then

970
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,700
Raven has obviously a lot of blacks and

971
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,140
a lot of you know gothic makeup

972
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,390
all right anyway so I just wanted to

973
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,790
call that out and I hope that that kind

974
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,370
of visuals improve because it made shots

975
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,110
more interesting to look at

976
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,750
now that stuff isn't really done at

977
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,880
least to that degree in the Marvel stuff

978
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,400
really seen it so I appreciated the

979
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,290
attention to detail a little bit of

980
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,420
foreshadowing visual foreshadowing and

981
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,590
yeah

982
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,210
what about acting

983
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,890
we wouldn't didn't really cover that in

984
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:33,770
the review did ya little over-the-top

985
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,230
Robin was good yeah Starfire was good

986
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,329
Beast Boy can't really say much about

987
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:42,020
him yet but yeah okay problem I wanted

988
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,520
to throw that there anybody have

989
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,309
anything else to add terms of spoiler my

990
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:53,359
dear fiction do you guys think oh I want

991
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,569
to say yes but they're saving that for

992
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:59,240
like a future season if they get one but

993
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,339
it's gonna be an older cyborg he's

994
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:03,109
already gonna be a part of the Justice

995
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,599
League and when he comes he's gonna have

996
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,760
a funny joke or two with Beast I hope

997
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,619
they have to throw that arm already

998
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:11,210
starting to get excited for what they

999
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,319
can do for the series man we didn't

1000
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,670
potential yeah I've just worried so much

1001
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,839
about Beast Boy in the next couple

1002
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,520
episodes if I continue seeing when it

1003
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,349
continues to look bad it's gonna be like

1004
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:22,520
one of those sci-fi shows where I just

1005
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,869
can't seriously watch it anymore it's

1006
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:26,089
like this is horrible just do something

1007
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:26,450
else

1008
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,020
well if Titans is this surprisingly

1009
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,059
alright and in some opinions good I'm

1010
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,890
really looking forward to the next three

1011
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,450
shows cuz I think they were gonna add

1012
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,160
initially four shows right out the gate

1013
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,150
or at least sometime soon for the DC

1014
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,789
Universe app so there's our final thing

1015
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:51,680
Swamp Thing cool and there was another I

1016
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,720
think some kind of team-up film or maybe

1017
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,630
yeah or something like that

1018
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,859
star-spangled girl I don't remember but

1019
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,109
