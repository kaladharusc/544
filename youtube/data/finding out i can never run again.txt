7
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,950
so this is it this is the moment of

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,380
truth the radiology centers right there

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,730
and they're gonna like they're gonna

10
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,610
look inside my knee and let me know if

11
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,590
this is like see I'm not a guy who's

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,240
afraid of much I'm not afraid of fast

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,100
motorcycles jumping out of airplanes

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,740
flying in helicopters risk risk is

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,560
something I typically do not avoid there

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,750
are only a few things in life that scare

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,030
the everliving shit out of me and this

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:27,580
video is about one of those things I'm

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,619
injured something is wrong with my leg

20
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:32,080
and there's definitely a chance that

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:51,009
I'll never be able to run your you and I

22
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,300
are the same age what does this mean for

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:03,850
the rest of your life that's my sister

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,130

25
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,470
and now she's trying to trying to she

26
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,060

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,770
never be able to again the rest of her

28
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,250
life

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:25,590
I don't love going to the doctor

30
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,160
I don't ever look like the doctor now I

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,260
first noticed the pain in early July

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,910
that was like three months ago

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,670
and here's the thing I run like 60 to 80

34
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,620
miles a week every week and I've done

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,750
about that for the last 10 years plus

36
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,730
you get pains all the time this one was

37
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,510
a little different

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,880
it was persistent it never went away I

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,110
haven't been totally responsible the

40
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,400
minute I felt a pain I went to a guy a

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,900
running specialist he taught me some

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,190
stretches I've been doing it you're

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,410
lying your side faced me and now then

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,160
get on a diet I'll try to do 50 reps

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,100
[Music]

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:18,130
I shouldn't be able to run I have no

47
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,320
business front I broke my leg about a

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,360
decade ago I broke in 27 places this

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
right here this is all metal and in the

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,350
hospital the doctor told me Casey you're

51
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,130
never gonna be able to run again but I

52
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,140
was 26 years old then there's no way I

53
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,520
was gonna let that doctor tell me I was

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:50,080
never gonna run again and since that day

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,490
since the doctor told me I'd never run

56
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,030

66
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,970
me freaked oh wow go in the moment and

67
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,350
I'm sewing and they say I'm possessed

68
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,490

69
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,130

so filing me I could eat shit bout to go

73
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,210
I'm doing honey but there's nowhere to

74
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,210
go and there's no way to slow if I knew

75
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,160
what I knew in the pan I would have been

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,210
like that on your way

77
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,280

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590
including this camera to go and check me

79
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,949
out now now I've got an addictive

80
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,630
personality it's why it's why I don't do

81
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,020
drugs I avoid drinking I I focus on the

82
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,370
things in life that I can let myself

83
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,069
become addicted to that's family that's

84
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,380
worked and that's running but running

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,750
running is a unique part of my

86
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,060
personality of my brain of Who I am

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,280
I run almost every single day I don't

88
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,810
have my runs when I'm tired I and my

89
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,550
runs when I ran out of time if I had

90
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,740
more time I would run more I run once a

91
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,970
day sometimes twice a day

92
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,530
I run a dozen miles on Monday another

93
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,970
dozen on Tuesday and I'll keep that

94
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,740
going until some sort of external force

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:33,530
gets in my way my life in general family

96
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,180
friends the noises the distraction my

97
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,729
work everything is non-stop everything

98
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,949
in life is just absolute chaos I'd have

99
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,780
it no other way but through all of that

100
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,270
mania through all that cast there's one

101
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,280
consistent there's one thing that's mine

102
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,020
one thing that I absolutely can't live

103
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,479
without one thing that makes me sane one

104
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,970
thing that grounds me and that that one

105
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,170
thing is running

well good news and I've got no news

111
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,589
turns out it takes 24 to 48 hours before

112
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,110
my doctor gets to review that MRI and I

113
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,169
find out what's going on so this is

114
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,499
gonna have to be a to be continued

117
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,669
find out the conclusion to this story is

118
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,339
nothing compared to my desire to find

out the conclusion to this story
