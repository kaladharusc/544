1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,589
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,510
YouTube boogie2988 coming at your levels

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,040
again through the power of the internet

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
never since Diablo immortal got

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,260
announced there has been a bit of a

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,330
internet culture war going on on one

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,309
side you have a lot of gamers who are

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,070
into video games but despised mobile

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,050
gaming for some reason and on the other

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,670
side you have a lot of culture warriors

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,189
who are defending Blizzard defending

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,230
mobile gaming who don't seem to really

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,869
understand why the other group is so

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,580
upset so today I thought it would make a

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,740
video trying to explain to people why

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,230
traditional gamers entrenched gamers

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,200
tend to hate mobile games so very very

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,940
much before we try to break this down

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,829
here's an important statistic you should

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,129
know the global games market for 2018 if

21
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,450
you look at this chart you'll see the

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,940
mobile gaming has brought in 70 point

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,039
three billion dollars so far this year

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,320
whereas PC gaming is brought in about

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,539
thirty two point nine billion and

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,800
console gaming has brought in about

27
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,469
thirty four billion so mobile gaming so

28
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,140
far in 2018 has made twice as much money

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,420
as PC gaming or twice as much as console

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,510
gaming or as much as both of those

31
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,740
combined and so you can see where a

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,180
company like Blizzard would absolutely

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,030
want to get involved with that and I

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,320
think when you start to compare and

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,030
contrast the highest grossing of PC

36
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,830
games highest-grossing console games

37
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,530
versus the highest-grossing mobile games

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,060
you begin to understand why traditional

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,729
gamers don't care for that genre so much

40
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,710
I mean take a look at this list of the

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,320
best-selling console slash PC games of

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,840
from 2018 and this was published back in

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,360
July so you're looking at far cry 5 God

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,119

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
unknowns battlegrounds all of these

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,420
games have plenty of stuff in common

50
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,369
obviously they're built for the big

51
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,049
screen they're built for nice 1080p or

52
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,119
4k television they're built to be played

53
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,680
on the console or a PC so they're made

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,540
to be played with mouse and keyboard or

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,670
with the controller and sure they do

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,070
have some level of microtransactions but

57
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,530
all of these games are very very deep

58
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,439
very detailed with high-end graphics the

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,789
kind of stuff that the average Western

60
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,950
gamer including myself likes to enjoy

61
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,450
and when we take a look at the

62
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,740
top-grossing iPhone

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,330
we do have fortnight on that list which

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,040
is kind of cool but candy crush saga

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,760
something in common - there's the

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,230
obvious cosmetic stuff all of these

71
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,790
games are designed for a small screen a

72
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,620
lot of them use touchscreen controls

73
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,420
they tend to be much simpler games

74
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400
rather than deeper story games like

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,490
you'd find on a PC or a console but

76
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,380
that's not the one I think we all take

77
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,320
issue with a traditional console game or

78
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,630
a traditional PC game might start as

79
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,520
cheap as twenty or forty dollars you

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,290
might spend as much as 60 bucks on the

81
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,970
basic edition and if you want to get the

82
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,100
DLC the season pass and all of the stuff

83
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,900
that's in it you might expect to spend

84
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,880
as much as a hundred sometimes as much

85
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,610
as a hundred and twenty dollars total on

86
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,780
that game

87
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,150
and that's a lot of money to us candy

88
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,620
crush on the other hand is billed as a

89
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,600
free-to-play game except you could spend

90
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,310
$14 19 20 40 maybe even $74 in it you

91
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,080
could spend more for just

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,820
microtransactions in this free-to-play

93
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,650
game than you would spend on an entire

94
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,070
copy of a game like God of War fortnight

95
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,560
also has a $10 package for V bucks or 25

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,070
bucks or 60 bucks or even 99 bucks if

97
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,720
you want to start downloading cosmetics

98
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,070
for your free-to-play game and that

99
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,750
tends to be the case for almost every

100
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,700
mobile game specifically the ones that

101
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,530
are on the top grossing list they tend

102
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,630
to be very very simple games designed

103
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,150
around high-end microtransactions of 60

104
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,180
70 $90 you don't get the graphics you

105
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,580
don't get the gameplay you don't get

106
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,770
anything other than a game designed

107
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,020
around milking you out of those micro

108
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,430
transactions that's free to start

109
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,200
eventually hit a pay wall and either you

110
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,550
uninstall the game when you hit that pay

111
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,620
wall or you start spending money and

112
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,090
nobody's saying that these games are not

113
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,680
fun some of these games are very very

114
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,780
fun fortnight is a very popular game I

115
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,910
still play pokemon go every once in a

116
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,530
while as an excuse to get out into the

117
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,330
world and do a little bit of walking but

118
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,410
there's still a striking difference

119
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,360
between these games and traditional

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,250
games I mean if you grow up on something

121
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,569
like this

122
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,860
then you might realize it's a little bit

123
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,360
jarring when the world is obsessed with

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
with this

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:40,309
[Music]

126
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,869
but where becomes really frustrating is

127
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,459
when you realize god of war only cost

128
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:47,399
$60 and $60 for the micro transactions

129
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,139
and candy crush it's only gonna help you

130
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,909
beat like ten levels when it comes to

131
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,499
the Diablo franchise you have to realize

132
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,509
it is one of the deepest franchise and

133
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,579
longest-running franchises to exist

134
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:57,929
there's three different games to choose

135
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,849
from each more deep than the last but

136
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,949
Diablo 2 is still getting played right

137
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,659
now to this day the servers are online

138
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,819
people are still buying copies of that

139
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,169
game and that game is almost twenty

140
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,159
years old now

141
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,809
every game of the Diablo franchise has

142
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,239
dozens of different Maps tons of bosses

143
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,129
to fight thousands of items to collect

144
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:15,779
several different classes to play them

145
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,179
with I mean they are incredibly deep

146
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,009
games that have some repetitious

147
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:21,749
gameplay but rewards you for that

148
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,219
repetition and when it comes to that

149
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,779
repetitious gameplay when it comes to

150
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,639
that addicting gameplay that Diablo is

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,829
known for that does sound kind of

152
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,209
familiar because it might sound a lot

153
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,099
like Fortnight it might sound a lot like

154
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,279
Pokemon go it might sound a lot like

155
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,439
candy crush except the Diablo games have

156
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,049
always historically only run you $60 and

157
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,789
then it was all you can eat buffet you

158
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,139
could play as much as you want you could

159
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,999
hit that loot pinata as often as you

160
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,219
wanted no microtransaction stores no

161
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:50,759
exploitive practices no $99 gem packs

162
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,199
that you could buy once a month or god

163
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,329
forbid the way some people do it once a

164
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,879
week a lot of the most successful mobile

165
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,679
games took some of the mechanics you

166
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,679
find in Diablo the the loot pinatas the

167
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,169
exploration the repetition and then

168
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,599
monetized them to make literal billions

169
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,149
of dollars on a free-to-play game Diablo

170
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,859
has always been right for this and lord

171
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:12,779
knows they tried to do it with Diablo 3

172
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,609
with the real money auction house and

173
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,439
Lord knows when they bring it to mobile

174
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,179
they're definitely gonna do it there and

175
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,009
think about the player who bought Diablo

176
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,189
3 five years ago for $60 and has been

177
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:24,989
playing that game off and on ever since

178
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,029
think about the player who paid $60 for

179
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,939
Diablo 2 almost two decades ago and has

180
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,309
been playing that game ever since for

181
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,679
that $60 it's an obsession it is an

182
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,689
addiction it is a game that they love to

183
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,369
play and they've been terrified that

184
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,739
Blizzard would monetize it and you know

185
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,929
that they will when they move to mobile

186
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,519
and that's what the outrage is about

187
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,229
Blizzard knows exactly what they are

188
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,360
doing they are taking a game that is

189
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,429
designed on addictive gameplay and they

190
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:50,940
are going to

191
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,950
monetize it in a hopes to get certain

192
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,990
whales certain addictive personalities

193
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,420
to spend hundreds of dollars thousands

194
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,820
of dollars tens of thousands of dollars

195
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,670
per individual on that addictive

196
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,770
gameplay that's exactly what they're

197
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,940
going to do with this game and that's

198
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,500
what everybody's afraid of that's what

199
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,230
everybody's upset of the blizzard and

200
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,970
Activision is willing to literally

201
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,790
destroy lives and put people into debt

202
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,460
using addictive gameplay rather than

203
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,210
just sell it to everybody for 60 bucks

204
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,770
you're damn right we're upset and if you

205
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,210
don't believe that people get addicted

206
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,860
to these mobile games and these micro

207
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,660
transactions and spend hundreds of

208
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,770
thousands of dollars then you've not

209
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,510
been paying attention a simple Google

210
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,400
search will show you people who's ruined

211
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,620
their lives being addicted to these

212
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,300
games but yes there are plenty of

213
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,980
players who are upset about the fact

214
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,840
that we're ditching the mouse and

215
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,490
keyboard and we're ditching the

216
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,170
controller and a favor for a crappy

217
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,510
touchscreen control setup and there's

218
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,500
plenty of players who are upset about

219
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,940
the fact that recording from their giant

220
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,130
60-inch television or their 30-inch

221
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,140
monitor tie it down to their tiny little

222
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,330
8 inch screen and there's some of us who

223
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,919
spend a lot of money on our high-end

224
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
processors for our computers and

225
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,230
graphics cards

226
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,360
we're upset that we're going to go with

227
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,130
our tiny little microchip and our phones

228
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,870
instead yes that is an accurate

229
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,940
complaint and I think it's a viable one

230
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,220
as well but the mass majority of us who

231
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,050
are upset by diablo immoral and the mass

232
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,060
majority of us who are upset by mobile

233
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,430
gaming in general are mostly upset about

234
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,530
the fact that mobile gaming is designed

235
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,350
to milk the consumer oversimplified

236
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,690
gameplay built around gamblers fallacy

237
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,810
built around loot boxes built about wait

238
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,720
time and built around frustration also

239
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,760
that you can spend microtransactions and

240
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,890
micro is being very kind there because

241
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,130
we're talking $99 bundles to bypass

242
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,320
those frustrations to get back into your

243
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,839
oversimplified - gameplay now compare

244
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,969
that to the Diablo 3 compare that to

245
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,919
game a God of War compare that to the

246
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,500
new Spider Man game and you can see the

247
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,420
source of frustration the biggest client

248
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,190
back I have seen here is two things

249
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,110
number one this game isn't designed for

250
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,660
you boogie and number two you don't have

251
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,850
to play it but Blizzard knows that

252
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,530
there's plenty of players who are going

253
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,480
to play this game even but grudgingly

254
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,760
plenty of people in the Asian markets

255
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,140
are just going to love this game being

256
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,540
on

257
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,800
and they're going to play it deeply and

258
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,960
spend millions of dollars doing and but

259
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,490
a lot of Western gamers who've been

260
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,590
waiting for six years for a new Diablo

261
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,120
game some people who are disappointed

262
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,380
with Diablo 3 who've been waiting since

263
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,020
Diablo 2 to play a Diablo game they are

264
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,150
going to be grudgingly and frustratingly

265
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,890
play this game even if it is a

266
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,960
simplified game scheme even if it is

267
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,850
designed to milk them because they love

268
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,410
the world of Diablo they love the

269
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,480
storyline they love everything about

270
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,520
that world and instead of selling it to

271
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,500
them for $60 maybe with a season pass

272
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,540
maybe with some DLC maybe with some

273
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,030
cosmetics instead they're selling it to

274
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,980
you on mobile on a platform you don't

275
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,200
want to play it on a place that you

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,460
don't experience with the controls that

277
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,830
you hate and they're going to monetize

278
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,750
the living hell out of it to try to milk

279
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,810
you for as much money as possible

280
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,010
players are gonna put up with it but

281
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,270
we're gonna be damn mad about in the

282
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,680
meantime and as for a sense of

283
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,420
entitlement yes I do feel a little bit

284
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,860
entitled because I bought the first

285
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,360
Diablo a couple of times

286
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,640
I bought Diablo 2 several times and I

287
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
bought every expansion and I bought

288
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,030
Diablo 3 and I bought the collector's

289
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,190
edition and I've invested hundreds of

290
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,770
dollars into the Diablo franchise so I

291
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,110
do feel not just as a gaming commentator

292
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,240
but as a player and a supporter of the

293
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,130
franchise I do have a right to complain

294
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,990
about something I don't want and I do

295
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,330
have a right to ask for what I do want I

296
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,880
do feel that I I cannot understand why I

297
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,710
wouldn't have that right you'd need to

298
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,910
explain that to me in the comment

299
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,560
section below and I'll admit some

300
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,690
players may take it too far with the the

301
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,580
personal insults and the attacks on

302
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,740
Twitter and things along that lines I

303
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,270
think that's never welcomed but to make

304
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,800
a video like this to complain about it

305
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,630
to make posts about it on reddit to say

306
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,890
that it feels like a slap in the face

307
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,810
for a franchise that you've supported

308
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,520
for 20 years I think all of that's fine

309
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,870
I think there's absolutely no problem in

310
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,160
that and if you do have a problem with

311
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,230
that maybe you shouldn't be watching my

312
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,910
channel honestly if you have a problem

313
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,050
with that then you don't understand

314
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,450
basic supply versus the man you need to

315
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,310
take an economy course or business

316
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,230
course because you should need a college

317
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,820
course to teach it to you but it'll help

318
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,620
but as usual this is one man's opinion

319
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,080
now I did ask you guys on Twitter what

320
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
your opinion was about mobile games in

321
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,140
diablo immortal and i used a lot of that

322
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,670
for this video but i will be reading

323
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,140
more comments as we go so leave a

324
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,760
comment in the comment section below let

325
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,020
me know what you thought about this

326
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,950
video what you thought about this

327
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,900
opinion whether or not you love mobile

328
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,250
gaming whether you hate mobile gaming

329
