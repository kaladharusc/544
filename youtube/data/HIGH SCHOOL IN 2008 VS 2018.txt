1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,760
- These are called noble gases  because they are nonreactive.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,920
Okay, who could tell me what I just said?... Megan?

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,240
- You said, a science. 
- That's the name of this class.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,580
Wow. These cell phones are rotting
your brains.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,260
They are nonreactive.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,400
Okay, who can tell me what I just said? Madison?

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,340
- You said that those are noble gases
because they're non-reactive.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,400
- Lucky guess

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,380
Which is actually incorrect because xenon, radon and krypton show minor reactivity

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,380
- It doesn't say that on the textbook

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,800
(Phone rings)

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,120
- He's so old and out of touch!
- How embarrassing! No wonder his wife's an old body pillow!

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,300
- I know right?

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:57,200
- I should have never opened up to
you guys.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,760
- And for homework, answer all the odd number questions on page 48.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,140
Alright. Eric, please stay behind.
I need to speak with you.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,440
- Ooooohhh!!

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,060
- Yes, Mr. Shardik? 
-  Eric, you're failing this class.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,700
I'll have to speak with your parents.
- NOT MY PARENTS!!

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,600
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,780
- Through 110. Uh, Ethan, stay afterwards
I need to talk to you about something.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,700
- Oooooohhhh!

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,020
- What?
- Ethan, you're failing this class.

24
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,980
Please, please don't tell your parents.
- Okay.

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,000
MOOOOOOOMMM!!

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,600
NONONONONONONO!!!

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,300
- Why are you failing my baby?!

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,400
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,580
- Did you guys see that Chris and Josh got in a fight? 
- Yeah, well we didn't see it but we were just texting about it.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,820
- Well, I saw it, and I got a photo!

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,380
Look!
- Woah!

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,610
So what are we looking at here? 
- Oh, sorry, that's a mirror selfie.

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,500
There. 
- Woah!

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:16,180
- I cannot believe you were there to capture this perfect picture! How fortuitous!

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,060
- Hey, did you guys hear that Caleb and Josh--

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,380
- Yeah, we have seen and heard everything and are therefore numb to any new experiences.

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,070
Yeah.

38
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,340
Neo is definitely still really awesome. You guys want to skip history class? 
- Why? What would we even do?

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,500
I don't know, Starbucks? We could drink a nutritious frappuccino then download the iTunes single of the week.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,520
I hear right now it's Regina Spektor. 
- Sure. -Sure. 
- Cool.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,260
- Fifty dollars for a fake ID. 
- Hey, you guys want to skip history class? 
- Why? What would we even do?

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,520
- You were thinking of skipping class?!

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,120
- No, mom. We're just kidding around.
- That's what I thought, young man.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,020
- Why is your mom so weird? 
- Yeah the rest of our 
parents just track us on our phone.

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:08,600
- Hey! I heard that!

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,800
- So Paul Revere traveled by horseback to deliver news of the British advancement.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,240
If only he was able to just send
a text message, right?

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,280
*cringing*
- No.
- Mr. Shardik! Talking about texting
doesn't make you cooler!

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,240
- And so Paul Revere traveled on horseback delivering news of the British Army's advancement.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,400
he he he he

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,700
I made that meme! You guys like memes, right?

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:53,340
At least they didn't cringe. 
- Oh, well, that's because we're too busy posting videos of your stupid memes!

53
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,300
- Well, it looks like everyone did their homework wrong so I'll have to take you through how to do it correctly.

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,620
First, where it says &quot;name&quot;.

55
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,860
You write your own name.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,120
- Ohhh.

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,500
- So no one even tried to do the homework.

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,140
- Well, we can't fail if we don't try. 
- But I gave you guys all the

59
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,900
guidelines on how to do the homework. Plus six examples of the completed assignment and a step-by-step

60
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,900
video of me doing the assignment. 
- You don't understand, Mr. Shardik.

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,580
If we fail, we will grow up to be weird, sad, old teachers that eat soup straight out of a can for lunch!

62
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:36,330
- Yeah, and who invite their students for their weird saddled softball games after school.
- And who, just to clarify, have an entire family of

63
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,640
weird saddled body pillows that they go on vacation with and are extremely physically affectionate with in a sexual way! 
- And who sucks on a--

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
OH- Okay! That's enough *makes a bell ringing noise*

65
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:59,820
Oh that's the bell. Go away!

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,520
Eat the pain away.

67
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,300
- Should have never opened up to you guys. 
- You're right. 
- Flip you! 
- I'm telling my mom you said that.

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,800
- Yeah, well--

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,500
*farts*

70
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,080
*laughter*

71
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:32,020
