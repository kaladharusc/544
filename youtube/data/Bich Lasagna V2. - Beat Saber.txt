1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,140
What's up my fellow bros?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,340
That's right 
(laughs)

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,420
That's right, I am inside videogame.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,780
Look at this

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,940
AHHHHHH

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,700
Mom someone put me in the videogame.
Now, let's freakin do this

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,400
We're gonna play Beat Saber. Oh, look at that, huh?

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,540
You're not so tough now, are you?  
We're gonna play Beat Saber

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:29,040
It's a game where you have lightsabers and hit to the tone of the beats. I sure hope none of this is copyrighted

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,800
because I would have wasted all the hours that I spent setting this up. For some goddamn reason

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,200
I thought this was a good idea. Let's freakin do this. I had no time to actually play this goddamn game

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,210
Beat Saber

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,420
So this is my perspective. This is how it looks for me. Pretty cool. Let's stop...

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,800
did I forget to put on my headphones?

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,340
I...found them, found them
No problem.

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,420
Okay, that's better I'm legit so excited to actually play it. Commercial pumping. I can do some fun things

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,670
Okay, let's freakin do it. Look at this guys

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,770
My saber, where is it?

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,790
I'm missing it...

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,470
What the Frank?

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,200
Let's freakin do...Look at it. This is my perspective look at it

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,100
So you're supposed to cut...you've probably seen everyone play this game, right?

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,380
I don't know why I'm explaining it. Okay

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,660
 

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,130
I don't know why whenever I play this. Ah

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,950
I feel so sassy

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:46,810
Doctor but I lost weight. I'm weighing them the wrong way. I was wearing them guys. It's not fair. I didn't realize I usually

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,850
Stop. Yeah, I do not fail normal Ligety. Oh

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,980

31
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,590

32
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,890

33
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,520

Do I look as cool as I feel like this goddamn it? I feel cool

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:37,750
Did you say that

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:45,460
Okay, all right you get the gist that's the song is kind of annoying you're still watching huh, there it is I downloaded

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,950
none other

39
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,520
Will it be because I knew everything would get copyrighted. So why not just play my own side

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:07,210
Nothing. Nothing pursue did but I must go all out. Oh, yeah, just it just this once

41
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,690
To do that

42
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,070
Okay, okay, okay wait I'll do I'll do no fail on that one just for the meme come on I don't like your t-series
