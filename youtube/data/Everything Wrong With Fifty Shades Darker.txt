1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,230
we send the uncut version of this movie

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,090
by accident and yes I'm giving the movie

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,410
a sin for this because ultimately I

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,700
watched about 20 more minutes of this

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,410
tripe than I should have had you Comcast

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,060
oh great dreams position explaining

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,680
Christian's toughness maybe we should

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,300
give this guy 45 more chances like

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,890
Anastasia does you mean is in the

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,390
director of Glengarry Glen Ross James

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,070
Foley and you mean is in the director

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,019
who's that girls James Foley reanimating

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,580
Madonna's corpse for a video full of

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,840
xylophone music would be better than

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,890
this this movie exists I know let's get

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,390
a cover of Coldplay's the scientist but

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,530
this time we'll make it slow and

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,570
mournful oh wait listen asshole there is

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,129
such a thing as planting right or

20
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,600
getting this bouquet to a cancer kid

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,860
still not sure what kind of pictures

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,450
this franchise has of Danny Elfman to

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,680
continue forcing him to score these

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,329
shirts who are these people am I

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,829
supposed to remember I'll be honest I

26
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,239
watched the first movie I wrote since

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,680
for the first movie still not sure I

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,670
remember any of it

29
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,739
I'm sorry Dakota Johnson is gorgeous who

30
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,149
decided to style her with these bangs

31
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,920
and two red lipstick for this movie Maga

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,170
- she's on the bus and the last movie he

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,790
gave her a car I guess we're jumping

34
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,810
ahead and they've broken up and she's

35
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,580
refusing his money in cars and thus

36
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,820
rides the bus now but the bus the bus

37
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,159
researching researching this dude is e.l

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
James husband this means to me is that

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,460
nobody in Hollywood wanted to write this

40
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,320
putting thing not even Anne Rice I mean

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,729
look at this fucking apartment

42
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,049
how can she afford to live here in this

43
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,640
place which in Seattle is probably

44
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,710
$3,000 a month or more but has to take

45
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,330
the goddamn bus home from work moving in

46
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,530
to make up its mind about how much money

47
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,479
she has my boss has me weighing in on

48
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,100
submissions I thought it was your former

49
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,750
boyfriend Christian Grey who was having

50
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,430
you weigh in on submissions the hell

51
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,930
kind of photographer invites a person to

52
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,579
an exhibit but does not tell that person

53
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,990
they are featured in said exhibit an

54
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,320
immoral one that's it like so much of my

55
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,350
face in here if I had asked you would

56
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,360
have been like I'm too shy also sounds

57
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,740
like another way of saying no but let's

58
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,240
go with the I'm too shy bit to soften it

59
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,670
they just bought all six if only he'd

60
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,990
known there was an untapped Christian

61
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,490
Grey market out there he could have made

62
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,049
the whole exhibit Anastasia Steele and

63
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,000
retired just talk please have dinner

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,590
with me yeah I just went from just talk

65
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,600
someplace private to dinner wicked fast

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,130
Jose watches her lead with Christian and

67
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,630
looks on disapprovingly because he is

68
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,099
the Jacob in this movie which means he

69
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:09,509
hates Christian loves Anna and will

70
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,410
eventually fall in love with her

71
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,520
daughter roughly a few months after

72
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,140
she's born Christian leads Anna into

73
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,460
murder

74
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,050
Alley which is bad enough but then he

75
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,160
starts to kissing her with no warning

76
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,380
which seems kind of wrong but she kisses

77
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,610
him back this movie spent its first nine

78
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,900
minutes pouring on the evidence that she

79
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,250
hated him but 10 minutes after their

80
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,660
first reunion they're both down to whose

81
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,160
hornier these characters at the people

82
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,130
writing them two-stage medium fries

83
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,080
cream vegetables Wow okay first Santa's

84
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,490
for ordering for your female date like

85
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,050
you're in the 1950s I don't care that

86
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,490
she shows power by correcting him and

87
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,600
ordering a quinoa salad mmm sin for his

88
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,640
ordering still stands second sin is for

89
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,170
simply saying cream vegetables as part

90
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,400
of your order that could mean anything

91
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,810
from creamed spinach to boiled cabbage

92
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,160
to canned peas I know you're more

93
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,390
worried about talking to Anna than the

94
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,490
meal itself as is the movie but god damn

95
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,720
dude order like you've eaten a meal

96
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,520
before Jesus I'll have the meat to

97
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,190
vegetables in a carb of some kind things

98
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,170
you said that's the way you are I mean

99
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,850
cinemasins did a whole bonus round on

100
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,110
that no rules

101
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,060
how does this ever get fifty shades

102
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,060
darker without any punishments and no

103
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,830
more secrets she seems more concerned

104
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,090
moving forward that he won't keep

105
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,320
secrets from her than she is that he

106
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,580
might viciously spank her ass with a

107
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,930
whip again I see along with her bangs

108
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,460
anna has also recently trimmed her

109
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,620
perspective reattached look if you're

110
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,970
just gonna start naming movies that are

111
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,990
way better than this one we're gonna be

112
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,960
here a long time

113
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,770

120
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,780
his intentions Christian this is Jade

121

123
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,330
his girl's boss this way is an asshole

124
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,400
and trust me I know assholes wait that

125

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,670
about her an extremely possessive terms

131
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,080
and this movie is allowed to continue

132
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,300
yeah you new favorite flavor

133
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,740
god damn it now I'll never be able to

134
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,210
use vanilla ice cream during a sex act

135
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,440
again without getting grossed out

136
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,700
never dick rush a guy who is actively

137
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,900
chopping vegetables with a sharp knife

138
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,850
do you want severed fingers because this

139
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,240
is how you get severed fingers no that's

140
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,489
dude she already brushed your dick and

141
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,780
insinuated you guys were about to be

142
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,220
sleeping with each other suddenly the

143
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,720
chest is off-limits maybe I should have

144
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,740
paid attention to the nightmare at the

145
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,090
beginning but I think you and I can

146
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,320
agree this movie was asking too much

147
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,720
this is her bedroom okay first of all if

148
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,250
Kevin Costner kills them tonight he will

149
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,660
get photographed by someone across the

150
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,650
way taking photos

151
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,450
second of all someone is surely across

152
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,510
the way taking photos just I'm sure that

153
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,860
sounded sexy and the screenwriters head

154
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,360
but he never bothered to say it out loud

155
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,010
also movie we're only watching for the

156
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,460
sex takes over 21 minutes to sex

157
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,870
you already asked us in the kitchen two

158
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,910
minutes ago and she replied you so why

159
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,500
are you asking it again pants on pink so

160
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,820
was that figure in the bedroom just for

161
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,470
us was a foreshadowing was it a dream

162
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,390

163

166
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,840
in eight minutes where the movie is

167
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,280
allowed to continue after Christian Grey

168
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,200
does something like this holy hell you

169
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,640
could fit an entire clown cars worth of

170
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,230
clowns under that big-ass umbrella you

171

sure if I went to see this movie in

178
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,770
theaters I would have been kicked out by

179
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,599
now first off I'd be unable to keep up

180
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,280
sin ADIZ to a minimum second off my

181
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,660
hands would constantly be thrown up in

182
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,310
the air wondering why Anastasia puts up

183
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,110

goodest of points this is King Seattle

188
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,530
and there are likely three dozen

189
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,150
overpriced spas for rich dudes to pay

190
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,169

Shades Dumber am i right I had them

205

drawn up and any perspectives of Miss

206

207
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,310

208
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,530
he's a stalker predator abuser and

209
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,090
probably more we don't even see like an

210
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,880
insider trader this isn't a relationship

211
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,889
Christian its ownership she's 100% right

212
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,659
and yet the rest of this movie and at

213
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,979
least one more movie will still continue

214
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,960

denna please and that's all it takes to

217
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,620
get her to agree she was literally just

218
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,599
justifiably lambasted him for his

219
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,639
multiple sub spying etc but he says

220
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,409
please and she just relents ladies of

221
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,060
the world there are men out there lots

222
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,349
of them that do not treat women like

223
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,550
this and are happy to just give you a

224
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,139
roof and some cuddles when she's done

225
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,610
it's gonna be an upside down portrait of

226
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,319
Abraham Lincoln what does this do for

227
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,729
her the argument was about Christian

228
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,289
doing fucked up like giving her money

229
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,460
she doesn't want him buying the company

230
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,169
he works for and taking her to the salon

231
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,789
where Kim Basinger works had nothing to

232
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,620
do with no touch zones but now she's on

233
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,000
board with being with him after this Bob

234

god dammit you can play head games all

236
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,969
you want Christian but when you play the

237
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,440
pronoun game you've gone too far

238
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
job her name is Ana State Oh three

239
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,759
minutes of the movie or dedicated to

240
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,030
Benoit balls no this is exactly what my

241
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,560
college ex-girlfriend said when I showed

242
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,849
her my collection of Transformers toys

243
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,620
Brandon why me if chosen a poor time to

244
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,389
do so bad guys always travel in a convoy

245
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,979
of black ass you'd wait purpose was a

246
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,419
sex movie why are there bad guy SUVs

247
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,979
literally no one we've seen so far is

248
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,300
looking at you you got expelled from

249
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,759
ordinary schools for brawling that's

250
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,229
nothing he's been expelled from 14

251
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,819
nonprofit boards for bending people over

252
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,030
and spanking them suddenly random

253
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,319
properties the highly wealthy Christian

254
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,060
owns is a big deal to Anastasia when all

255
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,110
the other terribleness should have had

256
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,669
her running since Rio one movie is

257
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,590
modern and takes place in roughly 2016

258
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,689
2017 but here's the television set from

259
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,830
1998 just for kicks look I'm down with a

260
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,270
good sexual spanking like anyone else

261
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,770
but why does this matter this is why

262
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,939
these kinds of movies don't make good

263
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,620
sequels the shock of it all was spent on

264
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,879
the first one and what's worse her

265
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,289
concerns about this guy are completely

266
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,879
gone I can't write this as a sin and

267
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,770
Chris will and should delete it but

268
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,779
goddamn does she have a great ass the

269
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:22,250
character I mean aren't you supposed to

270
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,020
create a safe word I nominate the word

271
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,330
Twilight

272
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,710
this goes on for some time Christian

273
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,210
doesn't even take off his pants and I

274
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,009
get that urgency for sex does happen and

275
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,719
sex with pants on does happen but

276
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,310
regardless the scene is being played as

277
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,839
passionate when really Anna sporting

278
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,039
eyes are being utterly chafed right now

279
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,870
by some combination of belt part slipper

280
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,430
parts and cotton polyester blend cloth

281
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,199
maybe I've just outed myself as a sex

282
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,519
should be done mostly naked proponent

283
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,660
but it's a platform I'm willing to base

284
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,980
my entire political campaign around

285
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,600
meanwhile back at the ball we don't give

286
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,769
a shit about in the first place they

287
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,000
move it to science to show us that the

288
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,620
ball is still going on well isn't that

289
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,269
neat fake photo of young Christian gray

290
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,860
is so fake that I'm surprised Anastasia

291
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,269
doesn't confront Christian about it and

292
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,779
again when he doesn't give her an answer

293
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,010
she's so near and dear to his heart she

294
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,899
wedges her picture into a USC poster

295
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,250
frame do you think you're the first

296
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,829
woman he'd hoped would save him lady you

297
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,500
literally just said without me he'd be

298
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,240
in jail or dead

299
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,430
so isn't he saved I swear to God and I

300
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,870
don't mean this as an insult but whoever

301
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,399
wrote this has never interacted with a

302
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,630
human being before it's like someone

303
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,339
asked an AI bought to rip off Twilight

304
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,019
and BOTS being BOTS we ended up with

305
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,370
conversations that make no sense like

306
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,470
this one he needs a submissive in life

307
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,019
not just in the better no he's changing

308
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,339
that Anastasia believes this ok a few

309
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,899
things here first you have a car

310
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,800
why were you riding the bus earlier

311
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,870
second they clearly establish that they

312
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,130
were going to Christians place but her

313
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,350
car is there why and the limo she said T

314
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,180
it in my house and he instead decided to

315
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,680
take her to his place so her car was

316
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,269
there already and she wanted to be

317
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,010
dropped off at home by the SUVs even

318
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,390
with her car at Christians is that why

319
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,130
she takes the bus yes the Vandals snuck

320
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,740
past security to wreck Anna's car

321
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,209
Christian's penthouse so we can't stay

322
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,339
there tonight but surely she has no idea

323
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:55,959
he has a boat right this boat on a

324
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,940
public dock is way more secure if

325
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,260
something were to happen to you because

326
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,610
of me Wow a psycho bitch just vandalized

327
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,380
Anastasia's car man she's perfectly calm

328
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,520
and confident that nothing is going to

329
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,480
happen to her should have called this

330
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,029
movie Fifty Shades dumber oh wait okay

331
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:11,560
minor props to the movie for still

332
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,060
having that lipstick on his torso but

333
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,339
also no one will be seated during the

334
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:16,990
anesthesia sponges Christian's chest

335
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:25,959
lipstick off scene Christian does not

336
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,760
open up and tell her those things but

337
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,830
they nonetheless they buff look I

338
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,360
understand why the first book and movie

339
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,940
were such big hits sex man dirty fantasy

340
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,740
sex but what is completely unclear is

341
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,360
how the sequel managed to rope anyone in

342
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,089
zero sex the stakes are not raised this

343
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,649
is just some boring Nicholas Sparks type

344
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,940
movie now this movie would have you

345
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,680
believe that Ana never goes a single

346
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,760
moment without her two bright red

347
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
lipstick handy she just woke up his

348
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
lipstick literally the first move for

349
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,260
her I mean I go to the bathroom and

350
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,520
brush my teeth take a shower

351
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,750
whether morning or just after her nap

352
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,370
this girl goes lipstick first then all

353
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,010
other concerns

354
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,610
[Music]

355
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,559
we now interrupt this movie to sell the

356
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,089
soundtrack to this movie also when I

357
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,529
think of a book and a movie Empire based

358
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,629
on BDSM I think of Taylor Swift in a

359
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:10,670
heartbeat you're going in circles is

360
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,019
what you're doing worse than that you're

361
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,790
backtracking then going in circles since

362
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,350
we already previously saw this shot

363
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,149
where you were past the unique island

364
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,619
with the clear brown rocky patch and

365
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:20,360
headed to the bay or maybe just maybe

366
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,100
the overhead crew shot a ton of b-roll

367
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,389
and then little attention was paid

368
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:24,319
during editing

369
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:25,850
regardless can we just agree these are

370
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,589
some lazy ass movies okay so does

371
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,360
Christian always send this dream of me

372
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,189
text or is this the first one because

373
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:32,779
remember earlier in the movie he said he

374
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,009
heard this bullshit and she sent back a

375
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:35,239
completely different text than the one

376
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,589
that appears here do we care one way or

377
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:37,759
another what Christian thinks about

378
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,959
Anastasia going to New York with her

379
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,160
boss do we care what happens if she

380
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
decides to go against his wishes maybe

381
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,160
there are people who hope they don't

382
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,480
break up but those people are sick

383
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,709
bastards and shouldn't be approached in

384
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,540
public also I hate to bring this up but

385
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,279
when she replies I wasn't asking it

386
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,779
shows that she punctuated it with a

387
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,129
period when it goes back to her phone

388
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,720
she didn't punctuate at all so now you

389
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,949
can all feel free to hate this movie

390
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,329
because I know you were holding back

391
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,309
before now say wasn't Christian's place

392
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:59,629
deemed not safe because that car

393
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,069
vandalism and stalker no one is caught

394
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:02,149
yet and that's why they slept on the

395
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,199
boat which they then took out for

396
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,489
leisure after why is this place suddenly

397
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,410
safe again the fatal stalker hasn't been

398
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,089
caught why leave that night but come

399
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,709
back a day later you're rather worried

400
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,639
about security or you're not if you had

401
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,899
a room like this in your home would you

402
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,459
ever forget to lock it I don't think you

403
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,230
would those are the nipple clamps I feel

404
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,459
like she should know this already and

405
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:20,660
now I think the movie is just getting

406
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,129
off on showing us sex equipment which is

407
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,290
a truly ironic fetish learn to walk

408
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,819
before we run

409
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:29,480
like running what no you don't that's

410
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,799
the whole point of these movies we've

411
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,989
seen so far last time we did this you

412
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,139
still another side of me and you left

413
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,569
no it wasn't holy Sh what is this and by

414
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:39,829
the way wasn't she pissed about him

415
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,119
putting his foot down about New York

416
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,379
what happened to that Oh

417
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,389
cuffs wow this franchise was supposed to

418
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,459
be about the edge of BDSM stuff but here

419
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,629
in the exact middle of the trilogy

420
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,069
halfway through the second movie we're

421
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,169
doing cuffs that's it is this the darker

422
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,759
they're talking about hey somebody wake

423
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,350
me up when the darker happens still got

424
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,699
an hour to prove the title isn't a lie

425
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,819
I'm so grateful for the opportunity jack

426
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,040
but I said short notice I made plans

427
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,629
that I can't change eight a minute

428
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:03,829
didn't she and Christian agree to go to

429
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:05,239
New York together and the previous scene

430
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,889
just three minutes ago isn't she still

431
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,299
going is this movie now saying she's not

432
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,860
going

433
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,320
now if you're gonna get way to

434
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,600
prominence that you should do it with

435
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,670
someone who can at least make you

436
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,090
smarter what the actual plenty of rich

437
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,620
people penthouses have been filmed but

438
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,420
this might be the most couch infested

439
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,860
and heavily pillowed penthouse apartment

440
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,060
in the history of film i tried counting

441
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,290
chairs and pillows and woke up seven

442
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,440
hours later speaking portuguese before

443
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,820
we run Jesus Christ

444
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,140
like you care you're the one who's

445
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,340
constantly breaking your principles

446
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,550
voice box for example got 80,000 hits

447

about person who made up internet hits

450
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,280
as a positive marketing statistic

451

second of all 80,000 newsflash you dick

452
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,330
80,000 anything on the internet means

453
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,340
exactly nothing while she enjoys the

454
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,660
fact that she just got promoted to her

455
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,280
former boss's job I'd like to remind

456
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,810
everyone mostly her that this is a

457
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,430
company that is essentially owned by her

458

something everyone from your co-workers

to movie viewers will be discussing for

462
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,550
a long time maybe we could take this

celebration home you know for another

fingering her ear and I just like to

speak for Humanity when I say you cannot

475

finger a lady on an elevator without

someone else realizing it through at

sex

crazy when Tom Cruise shows up and

495
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,130
starts training Anastasia to be a real

496
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,450
pool shark and then they grand moff

497
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,010
tarkin Paul Newman into this thing hey

498
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,540
remember that chick who had the bandage

499
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,830
around her arm we thought was real

500
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,150
important and there was drama about

501
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,920
Anastasia's car getting vandalized yeah

502
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,750
I don't either then playing pool and her

503
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,190
being better than expected at pool is

504
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,780
maybe the stupidest waste of time in the

505
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,510
entire film and then he bends her over

506
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,980
and does her doggy style came here to

507
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,480
see the craziest sex ever and you got

508
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,800
that terrible sex scene between Meryl

509
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,060
Streep and Liam Neeson and before and

510
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,260
after you gotta love these kind of

511
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,430
movies where random people have the

512
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,630
ability to just break into whatever

513
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,160
place they want with no sign of forced

514
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,840
entry also didn't Christian have his men

515
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,250
looking out for this chick or did they

516
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,560
forget her like the movie did you should

517
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,090
have had a security system installed in

518
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,470
her apartment the day after her car was

519
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,150
vandalized that way no one would be able

520
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,560
to break in and give you reason to feel

521
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,020
like you should go up there with her now

522
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,010
you'd think someone outside like

523
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,240
Christian or his men would've heard that

524
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,940
gunshot master sleeps in your bed how do

525
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,650
you know that I saw you remember how you

526
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,240
left the curtains open told you someone

527
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,890
was watching Heil Kim Basinger was

528
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,540
probably out there watching as well yeah

529
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,280
am I wrong or did they just turn this

530
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,750
character into a submissive MacGuffin

531
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,130
like she's really not important to the

532
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,660
plot or anything just a tool so that

533
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,100
Anna will start believing she can't give

534
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,360
Christian what he really wants and

535
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,010
something called a Fifty Shades free can

536
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,260
be made sad dumpster walk say boss how

537
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,670
many shots are walking in the rain' do

538
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,020
you think we needed to truly convey her

539
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,040
current emotional state

540
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,410
oh man at least 16 now we know why it

541
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,610
rains so much in Seattle it's usually

542
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,020
because Christian and Anastasia are

543
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,310
fighting I'm scared

544
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,600
not because of the controlling nature

545
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,800
and all the red flags but because I

546
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,230
might not be submissive enough they

547
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,670
nearly broke up yesterday and she just

548
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,750
woke him up from a terrible nightmare

549
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,550
three seconds ago and he rolls over and

550
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,410
says this Christian Grey has a pommel

551
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,970
horse in his home gym and he's about to

552
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,470
use it as part of his daily workout

553
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,420
regimen this is impressive but god damn

554
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,980
there's still 30 minutes left in this

555
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,690
movie and all the conflicts are resolved

556
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,390
oh no Mary why because divorce is common

557
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,830
these days and not so much of a stigma

558
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,210
and I'll be having you sign a prenup

559
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,860
anyway so basically it's not that much

560
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,830
of a risk or leap

561
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,920
[Music]

562
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,180
pretty sure this character has already

563
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,040
been on-screen in this movie and yet no

564
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,780
conclude this is might still be the

565
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,220
movies fault remember that close friend

566
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,579
of Anna's who was a photographer

567
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,049
the beginning of the film showing up

568
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:01,649
since then so Seattle pop-up mobile

569
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,779
Street bodega actually has gift boxes my

570
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,699
ass I can't open it till the day though

571
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,409
the wall I give it to me now call it

572
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,360
delayed gratification or in the case of

573
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,309
this movie no gratification hey did you

574
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,539
guys know Seattle has a Space Needle

575
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,339
building cuz this movie seems determined

576
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,959
to make sure you do if he didn't before

577
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,329
jell-o movie calls Portland doll and I'm

578
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,860
ready to give this movie 50 sins out of

579
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,689
spite hell Portland Tennessee is less

580
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,130
dull in this movie they're proud and

581
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,720
progressive I hear pressuring a girl on

582
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,039
a marriage proposal response is

583
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,480
generally not considered kosher it's

584
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,889
also not wise given what limited

585
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:30,419
knowledge I have attained about women

586
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,220
over the years also do you really want

587
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,510
to get engaged over text messages

588
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,159
because this is how you can gauged over

589
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:38,820
text messages screen renders fantasy

590
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,320
about dying in a helicopter crash while

591
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,789
writing this bullshit accidentally makes

592
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,240
it into the script and gets filmed is

593
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,950
the main climactic problems seriously

594
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,480
going to be Christian nearly dying in a

595
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,669
helicopter crash like seriously so for

596
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,169
the sequel you ripped off 90% Twilight

597
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,000
and 10% San Andreas I'd get good money

598
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,559
if once they crash they get devoured by

599
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,970
vampires and werewolves because they

600
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,289
accidentally literally crashed into a

601
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,220
Twilight movie it was incredible hey

602
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,649
that guy the photographer guy from the

603
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,210
opening movie forgot about him for

604
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,830
nearly two hours but there is still

605
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,769
being that guy in stuff his colleague

606
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:13,830
Roz Bailey have been found safe and well

607
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,539
whoo that was such a horrifying three

608
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,590
minutes that they dedicated to this

609
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,970
helicopter crash for a minute there I

610
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,809
thought it was gonna be something

611
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,370
impactful to the story god I'm glad

612
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,080
everyone's okay also here's another

613
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,130
thousand sins I'm a photographer you

614
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,600
know I mean I realize it's late and

615
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,919
we're all jazzed Christian's survived

616
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,690
that deadly crash and I love Anna and

617
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,740
will never get to be with her but I

618
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,850
totally have valid reasons for taking

619
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,320
off early here Ruby goes through a

620
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,880
Return of the King length farewell and

621
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,669
it's only the second goddamn movie Jesus

622
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:40,230
this movie makes the word yes seem like

623
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,090
it's two hours long this is me

624
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,889
that's just dude if it's on a keychain

625
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,750
it's for life fully clothed the shower

626
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,360
for play all that earlier about his need

627
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,980
to dominate at the end she just relents

628
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,929
and says this honestly might be the two

629
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,669
movie franchise leads I hate most in all

630
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,960
of cinema they both deserve to be

631
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,669
miserable and die alone sorry but it's

632
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,649
true these people all suck why yes there

633
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,330
are 15 minutes left in this movie thanks

634
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,860
for asking how are you are you guys good

635
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,080
he's the one he sure is he's the only

636
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,669
person who can bring down the matrix and

637
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,110
give me that sweet sweet rage against

638
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,320
them

639
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,269
Sheen credits music have you called ray

640
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:15,679
um no not yet

641
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,389
Christian did though he asked for his

642
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,830
permission Christian gray asking

643
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,360
anesthesia dad's permission to marry his

644
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,500
daughter might have been a fun scene

645
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,909
which is why it was not included in this

646
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,409
movie Kim Basinger is pissed off about

647
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,970
something which proves my theory

648
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,049
when Kim Basinger is pissed about

649
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,669
something that means a whole other movie

650
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,049
needs to get me to resolve it you can

651
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,669
ask the producers of boxing Elena you

652
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,919
don't care about Christian he'll see

653
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,220
that I'll make sure of it you not the

654
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,690
actress but the movie for introducing

655
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,130
then ignoring this character only to

656
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,299
bring her back here at the end is some

657
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,820
kind of sequel teaser Oscar on Oscar
