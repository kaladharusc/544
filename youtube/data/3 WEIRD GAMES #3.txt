1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,260
hello everybody my name is markiplier

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,980
and welcome back to three weird games

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,179
now we're starting off with one called

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,120
drunk and dad's simulator and I don't

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,530
know why you're a bear but I think

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,120
everyone can relate to the whole drunk

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,090
bear concept I think if I if anybody

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,520
wanted to relive the ability of being a

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,359
drunk dad

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,369
which I guess is something that's pretty

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,099
common maybe but if people did then this

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,720
would be the proper vehicle to do it a

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,330
bear in pajamas who's completely naked

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,430
see this this doesn't work if you're

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,719
just wearing a shirt it just makes you

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,980
look like you're not wearing pants

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,660
anyway we got a lot of weird to cover in

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,890

113
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,919
the promo screenshots for this were even

114
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,779
weirder but everyone was saying that

115
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,929
this game was not what it seemed to be

116
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,029
and you've heard that a lot when it

117
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,669
comes to horror games but this one

118
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,860
people seem to be especially concerned

119
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,399
about what this game held in it so I'm

120
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,689
gonna be going into this with no

121
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,669
knowledge of what it could possibly be I

122
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,469
don't think I have anything extra to do

123
