1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,609
well ei you don't get up again with my

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,440
favorite franchise this time which

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,790
you've done before with battlefield

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,610
hardline but now it's the mainline

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,219
Battlefield series news stories are

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,300
coming out all over the place right now

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,529
analysts report Battlefield fives

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,019
preorder sales are weak they are weak

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,210
battlefield fives so far lower below

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,849
black ops for Red Dead Redemption to

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,420
this outlet here pre-orders are

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,300
reportedly very weak well I think one

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,770
angry gamer gets it wrong here they

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,450
never said very weak or throwing that

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,129
word in there and that's not correct

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,129
they said that it's just lower so what

17
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,230
is weak is weak a hundred million less

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,289
is it five hundred how much dollars is

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,969
it less one hundred million dollars less

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,160
fifty million dollars less we don't

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,719
really know but we do know that the

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,610
preorder sales are lower in comparison

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,250
to call of duty and to Red Dead

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,210
Redemption

25
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,780
- now why why is this happening well if

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,820
you listen to YouTube and certain

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,290
channels on YouTube I watched four

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,930
videos in a row just now because you

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,580
know I care about the battlefield 5

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,979
franchise and it sucks to watch this

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,080
video because they're celebrating they

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,270
are celebrating the destruction in the

33
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,009
lower sales of the battlefield 5

34
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,040
franchise due to those god damn liberals

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,130
and those social warriors putting women

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,619
in battlefield the reason why to them

37
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,570
that battlefield 5 is having lower

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,579
pre-orders is because there are women on

39
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,619
the box there are women featured

40
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,930
prominently in the trailers and there

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,540
are women in multiplayer and they're not

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,079
gonna spend a goddamn time of their $60

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,810
on on on women being in World War 2

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,189
because that insults their

45
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,840
great-grandfather were fought in World

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,290
War 2 no women in World War two in my

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,759
fictional World War two

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
ha ha ha t a victory for not my

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,610
battlefield hashtag Magga red hats

50
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,799
victory for against social justice

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,180
warriors but is it really that is those

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,930
segments of people who

53
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,090
don't want women in there who don't who

54
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,629
want to extremely historically accurate

55
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,219
World War two experience in battlefield

56
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,280
5 is is that really what translates into

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,340
the most lost revenue I don't know maybe

58
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,730
let's let's look at it so they say that

59
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,810
this at the evidence is this ei

60
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,489
basically shit on the community which

61
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,620
they do all the time and they deserve

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,409
sometimes to get some backlash they said

63
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,780
here's the backlash on women accept it

64
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,519
or don't buy the game so they are

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,519
laughing their asses off at these guys

66
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,010
who said if you don't like women in

67
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,650
battlefield 5 don't buy it and now they

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,720
are cheering the fact that there are

69
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,209
lower pre-orders and that pre-orders are

70
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,909
weak and and then they also draw

71
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,849
parallel to chief design officer Patrick

72
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,709
Sutherland leaving the company they say

73
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,569
well the pre-orders have been weak so

74
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,370
that must be why this guy got let go

75
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,709
they didn't want him there anymore in

76
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,959
fact he was the nude he was the chief

77
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,849
design officer over 12 years

78
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,400
so I actually here we can both agree on

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,049
something we can make this crossover

80
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,909
that I'm glad this guy is fucking gone

81
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,400
ok because he was terrible this is the

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,340
guy that that man that saw how much

83
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,019
money was being made in madden ultimate

84
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,840
team and fifa ultimate team just over

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,430
eight six hundred million eight hundred

86
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,310
million dollars annually yearly and then

87
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,169
he said let's go to our other games

88
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,540
let's go to battlefield let's go to star

89
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,819
wars battlefront let's do need for speed

90
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,909
all of our games and inject

91
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,799
microtransactions into that shit to know

92
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,290
and it blew up in his face with the Star

93
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,840
Wars community said fuck off and the

94
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,489
Star Wars community rallied and got

95
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,829
Disney involved and and really upset

96
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,780
things now this could be him leaving

97
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,879
could be blowback from that he and trust

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,729
me I've seen people on those four videos

99
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,199
I watched like all this guy's going

100
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,759
broke he's got to explain to his wife

101
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,879
selling his housing car that's actually

102
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,650
not true this guy's made millions of

103
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,650
dollars while he was there and it may be

104
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,599
that he's not leaving the company

105
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,370
because of what you think he is leaving

106
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,560
the company if you do a little bit more

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,050
research here you'll see that the

108
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,659
publisher really wanted him to stay they

109
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,160
gave him a 20

110
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,430
million dollar bonus to this guy why

111
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,630
well back in June that is so recent

112
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,910
they said they paid him a twenty million

113
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,460
dollar bonus for partly for the purpose

114
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,950
of supporting a longer term retention of

115
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,640
this guy

116
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,680
and he said now that peace out you know

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,630
this is my I'm taking the money and I'm

118
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,790
leaving is he gonna go make more money

119
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,350
somewhere else that's a possibility

120
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,990
nobody knows what's next for him or why

121
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,190
exactly he left but conservatives on

122
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,500
YouTube will tell you that the reason

123
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,470
why he left is because there is lower

124
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,610
pre-orders because of you know the the

125
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,250
women in battlefield 5 and because they

126
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,500
said accepted or don't buy it and people

127
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,810
actually went out and didn't buy it

128
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,480
but is that the real reason I mean

129
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,210
objectively or is it closer to this

130
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,670
you're putting battlefield 5 in between

131
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,550
one of the biggest Call of Duty's and

132
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,130
the biggest video game released this

133
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,650
year from a little-known developer a

134
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,080
little-known game you know from a small

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
indie publisher called uh you know

136
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,210
Rockstar I don't think many people buy

137
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,730
their games it's not like it's a grand

138
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,000
theft auto six essentially no no it

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
couldn't be that it couldn't be that you

140
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,950
know October is notoriously such a

141
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,260
filled month that I call it broke Tober

142
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,240
and I can't freakin possibly be review

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
every single freaking game in October

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,070
and that it's sandwiched in between two

145
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,200
of the biggest releases not to mention

146
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,240
all the other games that come out around

147
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,270
the same time now I couldn't be that it

148
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,360
couldn't be that this battlefield 5 is

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,960
the most poorly marketed battlefield

150
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,720
I've ever seen in my history of

151
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,669
following the Battlefield franchise and

152
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,470
you guys know how much I love

153
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,470
battlefield it was awful I mean yeah

154
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,510
there was a three-hour closed door

155
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,300
behind the door session for influencers

156
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,970
press what do they call it game changers

157
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,630
outlets it was fucking amazing three

158
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,280
hours of detailed information they

159
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,900
showed the gifts and animation

160
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,940
breakdowns and and just and I was like

161
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,190
please just release this to everybody

162
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,930
instead no they did the shitty

163
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,910
Trevor Noah presentation which was

164
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,540
fucking awful it really didn't give you

165
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,250
the details it really didn't show off

166
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,530
the game was more concerned about

167
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,030
mimicking The Daily Show with Trevor

168
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,660
Noah

169
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,910
on there in like a news report program

170
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,630
with awful transitions in comparison

171
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,970
Call of Duty had a great show on stage

172
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,220
even though they're ripping out features

173
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,259
you know and you would think so you've

174
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,050
got call of I mean yours and your PA is

175
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,270
essentially pulling another titanfall to

176
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,370
only this time they're fucking up one of

177
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,010
their main line franchises battlefield 5

178
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,110
they're jamming in the middle of the

179
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,350
biggest Call of Duty right and one of

180
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,510
the biggest releases of the year and

181
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,930
this is why in my opinion preorder sales

182
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,199
are lower okay the people that play Call

183
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,340
of Duty man they've really done

184
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,060
Activision has really done their

185
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,919
research I thought that this year maybe

186
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,690
some Call of Duty people would come over

187
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,940
to battlefield 5 because they realize

188
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,710
they're getting less from more but no

189
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,599
all they had to do was double the amount

190
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,960
of zombie modes and add Battle Royale

191
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,039
even though they probably fucked up

192
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,449
development really hard and they were

193
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,099
they're scrambling they couldn't they

194
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,990
had to pull out single-player and and

195
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,310
this was the year that I thought

196
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,229
battlefield 5 would probably crush Call

197
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,240
of Duty but and it's not happening they

198
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,919
know their audience Call of Duty people

199
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,680
don't come over to battlefield 5 and

200
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,840
with all these games coming out these

201
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,060
three plus those other major releases

202
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,740
plus I'm not even counting indie

203
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,409
releases people on't can't buy that many

204
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,479
games per month you're thinking the

205
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,000
average you know students whether

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,770
they're in high school or college as

207
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,510
maybe 60 bucks

208
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,210
maybe two games in a month maybe if

209
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,860
you're working really hard and you're

210
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,750
doing other things so what's that gonna

211
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,940
be 60 bucks that's gonna be that's gonna

212
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,610
be you know Red Dead Redemption at least

213
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,919
if I only bought one game it's gonna be

214
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,130
Red Dead Redemption - alright so and I'm

215
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,169
thinking that it combined so you've got

216
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,529
those reasons is it because of you know

217
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,630
the social justice warrior agenda to try

218
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,130
to pull women in our games and they're

219
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,589
trying to make us feel for for females

220
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,930
and have better representation in games

221
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,640
how dare they this should be

222
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,050
historically accurate no women is that

223
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,710
really

224
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,260
no I think in yeah that maybe people

225
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,270
will there are people out there it's

226
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,280
like I'm not gonna give you $60 of my

227
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
body until you take those women out

228
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,880
until you do to more and more

229
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,220
historically accurate in your fictional

230
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,470
stories the in the trailers there's been

231
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,060
women and and then one of the war

232
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,500
stories is gonna feature a fictional

233
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,690
story of a woman of female resistance

234
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,610
fighter are rah rah rah

235
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,010
I will not pay you $60 to all that's out

236
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,810
in battlefield six I better see no women

237
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,610
that I'll give you my money do I think

238
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,020
there are people like that yes

239
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,420
unfortunately I do but I don't give a

240
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,520
shit you know we've had World War two

241
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,170
before so when they come back to World

242
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,820
War two I was hoping for an alternate

243
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,400
take and they did one but I think the

244
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,680
reason is this one looks more like call

245
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,570
of duty this battlefield looks more like

246
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,400
call of duty than ever before with these

247
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,280
loud crazy ass trailers that make it

248
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,960
look like all the duty set pieces and

249
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,840
the sort of cybernetic arms or robotic

250
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,580
arms or whatever they're doing this

251
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,890
crazy customization thing if you're

252
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,630
gonna do alternate World War history

253
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,220
like that you could have gone real

254
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,170
alternate World War two and that would

255
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,270
have been crazy like Nazi invasion of

256
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,730
the United States some you know maybe

257
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,920
other countries getting involved or the

258
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,080
fight being a lot bigger in Africa or

259
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,320
Australia who knows you know or in the

260
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,510
Pacific it could have been crazy but no

261
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,040
you're going this direction so I think

262
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,050
that do I think there's lost sales over

263
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,300
the whole politicize thing right verse

264
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,670
left and right you know being happy that

265
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,950
that you know the the Swedish developers

266
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,780
over there at dice or are eating their

267
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,790
words yeah I think a small bit a bit but

268
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,420
I think it has to do more of the poorly

269
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,130
timed release date there are other just

270
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,070
big boys fighting there for attention I

271
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,850
think that the really lack of marketing

272
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,790
good marketing for battlefield 5 has

273
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,860
really heard it and I think the general

274
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,950
ill will towards EA people are so sick

275
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,680
of EA shit right now especially coming

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,960
off of Star Wars Battlefront 2 this is

277
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,300
their major shooter coming off of that

278
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,880
controversy I think that has more to do

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,160
with people you know they're people are

280
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,020
trying to let lead you astray of drama

281
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,790
whore and say this see this is why you

282
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,500
should feel good it's more you know fuck

283
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,540
EA and those people are like a fuck EA

284
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,550
it's not fuck year because women and

285
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,600
because social

286
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,069
just warriors fucking because they tried

287
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,319
to fuck me over that's what I think it

288
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:16,029
is but maybe I'm wrong so yeah a few of

289
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,839
you may celebrate this this bad news for

290
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,100
Battlefield but I'm not I'm certainly

291
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,870
not celebrating I don't like I don't

292
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,000
like pre-ordering anyway unless the

293
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,420
unless it's like I'm damn sure it's

294
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,279
gonna be the damn good game and I was

295
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,000
really close with battlefield 5 but you

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,029
know and here's another reason I I don't

297
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,149
think that battlefield 5 has had an open

298
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,620
beta yet I could be wrong

299
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,360
I know I've played it because I got a

300
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,329
key from my business management group I

301
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,279
think those latest ones have been closed

302
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,740
alphas and I think a lot of pre-orders

303
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,209
come in when people actually get their

304
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,920
hands on it and they play the new modes

305
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,990
and they play the the new feel of it no

306
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,029
okay well yeah let me put down a poor so

307
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:00,940
I just I hate to see this happen because

308
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,740
I thought this year the battlefield 5

309
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,889
franchise would do really well I don't

310
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,449
think it has to do with the fact that

311
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,579
this controversy non controversy of

312
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,550
women being included but who knows maybe

313
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,829
I'm wrong you guys give me your opinion

314
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,410
do you think it is 100% because there's

315
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,540
women in it or do you think it has to do

316
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,829
with more those other things that we

317
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,560
talked about let me know guys okay thank

318
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,569
you so much for watching and if you're

319
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,000
celebrating the the destructive the

320
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,730
lower sales on battlefield I mean I

321
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,389
can't stop you it is EA so it's like you

322
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,730
want to celebrate that but you don't but

323
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,800
me as a battlefield fan it's like ah

324
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,990
damn it you know you guys fucked this up

325
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,990
and and so again I'm mad at EA again I

326
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,689
just wish whoever replaces this this

327
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:49,120
Peter this Patrick I'm sorry about Peter

328
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,560
Patrick Sutherland guy

329
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,670
