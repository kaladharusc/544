hey guys what's up to be deluxe welcome

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,009
back to a vlog a video something I've

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,809
been working on for actually the past

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,509
month and a half now this is kind of a

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,219
more serious flog and explaining

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,920
everything that my channel has been

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,109
basically the past actually two months

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,029
now it has been about two months I've

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,519
been testing this out so I'm gonna get

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,410
right into it and also if you're new to

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,340
the channel

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,460
my name is Tyler Ellis aka deadlocks

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,910
I've been the youtuber since

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,920
professionally since 2012 I started off

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,570
doing minecraft videos up until about

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,940
2000 end of 2015 2016 2017 ice changed

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,160
up my channel doing challenges slash

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,340
slash you know reaction videos and I

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,629
based my channel for the past two years

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,460
off of that a lot of you may have

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,670
noticed two months ago my channel got

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,859
new channel art and all of a sudden

23
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,439
switched from doing do not look away

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,720
challenges one of my most popular series

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
on this channel reaching millions and

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,790
millions of views over 10 million views

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,830
on my do not look away challenge series

28
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,170
recently we all know that YouTube has

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,490
became become more strict when it comes

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,890
to their advertisement advertising and

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,979
advertisement when it comes to YouTube

32
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:34,320
and I was totally aware of that I'm not

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,150
saying I do not look away challenges

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,700
deserve to be monetized because the

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
majority of them actually probably do

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,450
not but my main point is I wanted to do

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,340
some research because I heard rumors I

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,189
heard you know basically just rumors and

39
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,420
things that YouTube will be doing to

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,840
youtube channels or what they can do to

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,850
your channel if you have certain type of

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,570
videos that don't meet the ad criteria

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,520
so that being said about two months ago

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,590
I switched my channel all of a sudden

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,150
from reaction videos to doing gaming

46
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,310
minecraft I did some roblox

47
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,430
I I just recently here uploaded a couple

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,450
reaction videos and it was basically a

49
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,250
lot had to do with my study on what

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,620
YouTube is doing what YouTube is looking

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,890
for are they black listing channels that

52
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,230
was a rumor are they

53
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,459
shadow demonetised your videos do they

54
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,730
only put ads on kid-friendly content can

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,250
you not be anything else but

56
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,220
kid-friendly a lot of questions a lot of

57
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,330
rumors out there and from what these two

58
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,959
months have told me well I can just

59
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,870
basically explain everything to the

60
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,310
people who have questions about their

61
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,870
YouTube channel people who are going

62
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,739
through an ad crisis like I I have and

63
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,030
had in the past and I can just explain

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,100
everything so let's start from the

65
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,670
beginning so basically I can probably

66
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,220
say four months ago for six between four

67
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,230
and six months ago my soul series was

68
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,150
still do not look away challenges that

69
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,329
being said I had a couple really good

70
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,100
months with close to about ten million

71
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,370
or even over ten million views for the

72
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,610
whole month pretty pretty good views

73
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,850
really good views and that being said

74
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,750
with you know this is going to include

75
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,670
you know information on how much I've

76
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,860
made by the way I'm not bragging

77
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm not flaunting or anything but with

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,010
that 10 million views that I made I

79
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,220
probably made thirteen point four

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,790
fourteen grand with YouTube ad revenue

81
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,930
and at the time that is actually not

82
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,780
half bad for it because I mean it's

83
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,269
always been that the type of video gets

84
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,700
more ad revenue but it's never gotten as

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,000
bad as it is today so I was still

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,550
getting the decent amount of you know

87
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,610
pretty good ad revenue when it comes to

88
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,750
my do not look away channel

89
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,000
I try not to laugh challenges I did the

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,110
year before that I a couple months I got

91
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,530
over 10 million views it was 16 to 20

92
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,040
grand for the month for about 10 million

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,990
views which is a little bit better than

94
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,850
do not look away but this was when this

95
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,120
was before basically the ad crisis

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,510
appeared all of a sudden they started

97
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,110
getting new rules for YouTube and I

98
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,570
started noticing that my my reaction

99
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,280
videos might do not look away challenges

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,770
we're getting lower and lower and lower

101
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,110
even though the views were still fairly

102
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,050
decent the ad revenue was getting low so

103
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,300
one the the month with this happening I

104
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,820
still continued to do it just to see how

105
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,410
it would go maybe YouTube would fix

106
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,900
itself which to this point they still

107
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,440
are pretty picky when it comes to it so

108
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,690
I noticed a lot of my do not look away

109
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,720
challenges if they are you know pimple

110
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,570
popping blackheads extractions etc you

111
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,169
know got demonetized pretty fast but the

112
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,720
time it was up that still got you know a

113
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,000
few thousand views before it got D

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,080
monetized only averaged about five cents

115
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,729
to twenty five cents per thousand views

116
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,169
where before I was averaging about a

117
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,750
dollar sixty a dollar seventy five which

118
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,330
is still low but I mean again as YouTube

119
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,710
has always had that where the type of

120
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,390
video can make more ads but I mean it

121
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,669
was still a decent amount of ad revenue

122
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,040
you know how much you make per thousand

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,320
views five cents to twenty five cents

124
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
was the lowest I have ever seen any of

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,229
my videos on any of my channel channels

126
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:28,440
from the beginning of time make now that

127
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,040
being said I was I talked to you know

128
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,020
multiple you know different types of

129
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,370
youtubers people who were struggling

130
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,960
with the same type of issues they they

131
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,340
were just saying you know yeah YouTube

132
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,639
are

133
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,919
now that there now you know raiding

134
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,340
channels like your actual channel so no

135
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,050
matter what you do you're gonna get that

136
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,749
same ad revenue you're gonna get that

137
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,759
same exact ad revenue no matter what you

138
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,529
do now because I had that main series on

139
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,240
my channel I said that doesn't really

140
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,479
make sense I said I kind of want to

141
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,469
figure this out for myself so what I

142
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:07,650
basically wanted to do and I also you

143
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,180
know pretty nostalgic minecraft so I

144
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,710
just thought you know videos aren't only

145
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,930
make it five twenty five cents let's

146
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,669
let's try to go back in a little bit

147
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,319
into gaming let's see how it does let's

148
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,360
see how the ads do let's see how the

149
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,849
channel does which you know I I

150
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,090
basically took a big hit in views all of

151
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,520
a sudden within a date switching back to

152
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,430
you know gaming minecraft etc so

153
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,180
basically the first a couple videos I

154
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,180
did let's see I have my screen right

155
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,319
here if I go up to him and then I go to

156
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,289
my analytics on the first three

157
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,089
minecraft videos I officially uploaded

158
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:58,050
they were averaging a average of let's

159
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,529
see

160
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:01,620
sorry guys bear with me so they were

161
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,149
averaging about 1004 views was about two

162
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,629
dollars and 32 cents I was seeing this

163
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,349
an average between the past two months

164
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:19,039
or so after pretty much consistently

165
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,240
uploading minecraft videos I was seen

166
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,580
about two dollars and 11 cents to

167
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,659
sometimes over $3 per thousand views

168
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:29,189
with the Minecraft videos that was

169
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,190
instantly switching from reaction to

170
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,560
minecraft so I kind of debugged

171
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,680
the dem grading your channel for what it

172
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,440
is and putting ads on your channel

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,180
basing off what you did in the past or

174
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,240
what you know your audiences I kind of

175
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,029
debunked that that's that's untrue you

176
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,100
can make the most raunchiest videos in

177
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,839
the world and upload minecraft the next

178
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,790
day and if that minecraft video gets

179
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,180
views it's going to get to Dahl

180
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,950
to over $3 CPM per thousand views so

181
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,500
they it is definitely they don't look at

182
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,040
the channel they look at what is

183
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,310
uploaded and what that video is and what

184
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,230
the key tags are the you know just tags

185
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,980
titles gameplay etc now those videos

186
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,370
were not you know demonetised either

187
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,480
some of the Minecraft were demonetized

188
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,010
which you know a lot of people are

189
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,760
having issues with but it's this has all

190
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,940
been a part of my research so the past a

191
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,970
couple a few days ago I uploaded a don't

192
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,140
look away challenge and a trailer

193
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,540
reaction so they do not look away

194
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,459
challenge was a hundred percent no

195
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:48,070
cursing not really graphic in any sense

196
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,480
just normal do not look away challenge

197
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,700
when it comes to Heights and you know

198
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,980
animals sharks etc so what I have right

199
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,720
here from for the don't look away

200
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,880
challenge is for a thousand views it

201
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,550
made 25 cents it made 25 cents for the

202
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,770
thousand views the first thousand views

203
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,790
it made now it's over a thousand views

204
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,350
but I also have the Avengers infinity

205
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,279
war trailer reaction which for the

206
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,330
thousand views it made a dollar 91 cents

207
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,660
that's a big leap from 25 cents to a

208
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,680
dollar

209
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,339
91 just because of tags and tags and

210
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,700
title now don't look away challenges are

211
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
mostly graphic so in their system they

212
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,070
must have a we're not gonna put ads on

213
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,529
this it's not I mean the thing is it is

214
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,529
it's it's it's approved for monetization

215
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,880
it was disapproved when I unlisted it I

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,300
put in a little thing for approval to

217
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,339
get it monetized and they did approve it

218
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,950
saying that it was able to have

219
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,890
ads on it but it still did not do very

220
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:17,110
well so our titles and tags important to

221
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,100
what you upload on YouTube yes it is

222
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,810
does it matter if they D monetize it and

223
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,300
they approve it for monetization if the

224
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,640
tags on the title are still something

225
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,520
that they kind of look down on it does

226
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,490
matter a lot tags and titles do matter a

227
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,690
lot

228
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,550
for example Avengers infinity war

229
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,460
totally innocent reaction made a dollar

230
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,350
ninety one per thousand views it's

231
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,880
that's because it's not a do not look

232
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,580
away challenge so it seems like shadow

233
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,630
to monetizing is a very real thing

234
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,020
because even though it was approved for

235
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,970
you know monetization it still did not

236
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,780
do very good at all it actually did the

237
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,060
monetization did horrible even though it

238
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,720
was approved for monetization so that

239
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,910
leads me to believe shadow D

240
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,660
monetization is a real thing and it's

241
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,870
something to look out for for creators

242
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,800
now what does this mean for the future

243
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,620
of everything of this channel what are

244
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,870
we gonna do in the future and just about

245
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,230
everything well I'd like to do a little

246
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,520
bit more research when it comes to

247
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,960
reaction videos because I definitely

248
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,520
don't want to stop my reaction videos

249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,730
and I'd like to see what I can get into

250
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,800
to still be a creator still create for

251
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
you guys and find out what I can react

252
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,740
to that can you know still keep this as

253
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,020
a job as well as a well-paying job as

254
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,330
well as I can fund myself to continue to

255
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,850
do the nice work that I have in the past

256
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,840
for the fans for the future they

257
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,730
definitely do want YouTube definitely

258
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,070
does want a kid-friendly content it's

259
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,380
actually you know as much as I will say

260
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,820
you know maybe my do not look away

261
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,970
challenges don't deserve to you know

262
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,800
maybe have ads on them because some of

263
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,850
them were graphic I will say if I upload

264
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,140
a don't look away challenge where it's

265
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,810
more innocent no cursing no graphic just

266
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,380
more you know like Heights edition

267
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,880
where you're looking at hi scary Heights

268
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,670
or scary sharks and all that kind of

269
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,040
stuff I don't understand why they would

270
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,050
still you know not throw many decent ads

271
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,230
on it it's I think the whole system is

272
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,690
messed up and I think they're punishing

273
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,280
a lot of creators I've seen so many

274
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,720
people on Twitter complain about this

275
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
I've seen so many people be stressed out

276
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
about this it's a real thing for

277
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,810
creators and it's a real thing for the

278
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,330
people the YouTube the future of YouTube

279
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,730
and future creators who don't even know

280
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,090
you will be a creator yet there's people

281
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,330
who blow up on a daily basis and you

282
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,270
know when it comes to ad revenue will

283
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,280
youtube be a staple job for youtubers in

284
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,830
the future at this point it's not

285
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,710
looking looking very bright for a lot of

286
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,630
youtubers and the future of people

287
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,700
actually making YouTube a job

288
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,970
I think they hand-picked favorites and

289
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,110
it's it's still such a huge mystery but

290
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,840
I spent these past two months debunking

291
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,960
what I wanted to know and now I know and

292
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,520
I think you guys deserve a little

293
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,690
explanation and that was basically my

294
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,310
explanation of why everything has been

295
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,310
such a cluster cluster f they're gonna

296
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,390
do monetize this video to a clusterfuck

297
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,830
but anyways guys thinking for listening
