1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,469
DC Comics al Ghul has the most

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,940
impractical living space of all time

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,710
unless there's some sort of hidden road

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,089
on the backside there isn't even a way

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,680
to get up here I don't even see a place

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,130
to land my helicopter I should never

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,010
have allied myself with a madman Rachele

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,810
Ghul instigates dropping a full glass of

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,070
wine after hearing something shocking

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,779
cliche prior to being told by his

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:28,920
assistant that the Joker's kidnapped

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,990
Robin also not sure what al Ghul's plan

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,669
is here but it's the fucking Joker of

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:33,780
course he's gonna kidnap and torture

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,340
Robin or who remember he can get his

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,809
hands off if he wanted a less mad and

17
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,250
senior partner he should have gone for

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,640
the condiment King or kite man nitrus

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,290
did Batman really go to the fast and

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,640
furious school of accelerating things

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,700
what hurts more I'm not completely clear

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,320
on the exact powers of Boy Wonder bread

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,120
here but he's invincibility one of them

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,739
cuz dude just took a crowbar to the face

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,329
repeatedly in is somehow still breathing

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,649
for all the blood that's on the floor

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,390
there is surprisingly none on Robins

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,969
face please tell the big man I said

29
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,670
hello other than newbies got a red hood

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,320
it makes zero sense that the Joker would

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,820
leave Robin alive and give him a chance

32
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,470
to escape before the bomb goes off not

33
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,850
the best Joker laugh I've ever heard

34
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,350
sounds like he's coming off a three-day

35
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,909
bender how did the masked air in that

36
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,409
spot without doing any damage to the

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,270
surrounding face in fact the opposite

38
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,470
eye seems to be the only thing that was

39
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,060
affected by all the crowbars Finnegan's

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,100
man even after an explosion Robin still

41
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,030
has flawless skin

42
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,020
you should have forgotten that whole

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,520
Supergirl gig and made millions off his

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,710
skincare secrets I enjoy stylized rainy

45
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,119
Gotham scenes as much as the next guy

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
but did you really need to take two full

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,600
minutes of a 75 minute movie to do

48
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,340
titles only no wonder Gotha has such a

49
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,750
crime problem the police department is

50
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,280
wasting all of its money on dirigibles I

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,500
thought it was Suchi was in my meet

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,570
Batman has an insane number of rogues at

53
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,009
this point and just about every name in

54
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,750
the book has been used we couldn't do

55
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,770
better than chichi

56
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,000
not to mention that was already a fairly

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,409
important female character from the

58
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,299
animated series named chichi so why not

59
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,009
piss off all the bat maniacs while

60
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,509
you're at it movie well we all know

61
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,329
that's a lie oh and a Deadpool get here

62
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,500
peddling scumbag number seven we'll be

63
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,729
on to something here except for some

64
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,020
unexplained reason none of these armed

65
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,429
hardened criminals actually fired back

66
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,170
when fired upon I will be running the

67
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,030
drug trade from now on you go about your

68
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,350
business as usual but

69
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,020
kick up 40% to me this works those are

70
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,210
the heads of all your lieutenants that

71
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,460
took me two hours and it was made into a

72
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,110
movie with Joe Pesci and the first Buffy

73
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,720
the Vampire Slayer 40% works for me

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,670
but how do they get it to him Red Hood

75
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,740
has the negotiation portion down pat but

76
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,970
needs to work a little harder on the

77
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,160
logistics side of his LLC I think I lost

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,660
him you think I lost them I think you

79
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,430
lost him no you didn't but if you keep

80
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,750
repeating every line of dialogue three

81
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,760
times you've definitely lost me okay I'm

82
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,200
willing to buy that maybe the back door

83
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,700
will come open but how do you not have

84
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,500
the only thing in your escape truck

85
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,270
secured in any way at least splurge a

86
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,010
few bucks on some bungees Batman is

87
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,660
addictive phalanges I guess this

88
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,980
superhuman Android thing will is

89
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,450
scheduled to hatch out of this metal box

90
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,010
right now nobody punched a code into

91
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,630
this thing why hire a crew to steal it

92
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,740
if the contents were going to escape

93
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,480
before they got halfway back it's called

94
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,370
a maze oh I know it's from the comics

95
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,120
but Amazo

96
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,300
what's next awesome you need Oh ghoulia

97
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,880
oh wait what the hell is an amazing a

98
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,010
highly advanced cybernetic Android

99
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,720
equipped with the ability to absorb the

100
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,670
power of superhumans that's planning

101
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,710
also that is a very specific description

102
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,360
pretty sure Batman gets all his info on

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,070
his wiki fandom page just like we do

104
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,690
packs quite the punch for a toaster on

105
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,790
steroids huh in 12 minutes we've had

106
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,430
racial ghoul Joker Jason Todd Robin Red

107
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,620
Hood Amazo and Nightwing all pop up with

108
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,120
little to no explanation not sure why

109
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,890
anyone was surprised how DC backed their

110
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,300
asses into the Justice League movie

111
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,530
they've been pulling this for years

112
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,660
that's Nightwing he was the bats first

113
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,540
sidekick the first Robin I see that this

114
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,760
Robin crew employs a DC nerd on their

115
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,810
staff who knows all things Robin I think

116
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,920
you'll have to do better than that boss

117
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,170
I did why didn't Batman just leave with

118
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,670
this why does this seem to be a common

119
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,350
theme in comic book movies I have this

120
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,670
thing that can end the battle quickly

121
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,230
but now I'll just punch the guy a bunch

122
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,190
first and see if that works

123
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,320
yes the same weak points as a human

124
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,450
being so Oreos and pornography them

125
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,190
lasers he's got lasers

126
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,360
Nightwing is the equivalent of The

127
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
Annoying theatre patron who describes

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,210
loudly and in excruciating detail

129
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,660
everything that happens on the screen

130
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,940
I don't think putty in his eyes is gonna

131
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,620
hurt him Jesus Christ Nightwing don't

132
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,460
you know your friendly neighborhood

133
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,200
Batman by now this isn't just putty

134
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,519
that's wrong with you it's like you've

135
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,019
never worked with Batman before we don't

136
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,870
have any choice did Red Hood purposely

137
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,250
wait to shoot his crew so they could

138
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,990
almost tell Batman everything the shots

139
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,970
came from the rooftop a sniper you think

140
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,890
honestly is one of Nightwing superhero

141
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,870
aliases Captain Obvious I'm sure all of

142
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,430
these indistinguishable windows on this

143
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,930
display are giving important information

144
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,250
but how in the world is anyone reading

145
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,780
any of this text couple making out on

146
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,850
rooftop gives Batman bad ideas later in

147
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,320
The Killing Joke movie Batman somehow

148
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,790
jumps through the roof in the one spot

149
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,890
he won't land in a vat of acid also do

150
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,540
all villains have these acid VAT

151
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,980
warehouses spread throughout the city I

152
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,300
never actually used the acid for

153
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,190
anything so what caused it they're hard

154
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,900
to forget that night huh it's harder to

155
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,100
believe that Red Hood witnessed what

156
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,630
Batman was flashing back to in his mind

157
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,520
zooming Red Hood was shooting the car to

158
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,660
cause an explosion that would kill

159
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,430
Batman then why didn't Red Hood just

160
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,080
shoot Batman this is probably what the

161
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
15th or 16th building to explode in

162
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
Gotham in the past month insurance

163
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,690
premiums must be insane State Farm and

164
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,040
Gotham's construction companies are

165
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,780
taking everyone's money Red Hood has

166
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,460
done it all including just basic

167
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,140
trafficking what was he trafficking does

168
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,910
it matter we cut that asshole Red Hood

169
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,180
it crime is down indeed it is

170
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,830
master Bruce got almost three hours

171
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,500
sleep in the last two days true busman's

172
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,090
holiday the percentage of the audience

173
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,860
watching this that know what this means

174
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,450
corresponds directly to the percentage

175
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,190
of things kanye west says that are fat

176
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,169
crazy also Alfred's technically wrong

177
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,000
here a busman's holiday is meant to

178
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,440
refer to people who keep working when on

179
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,480
vacation while Batman is literally doing

180
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,520
his job wait Batman and Nightwing can

181
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,990
just walk out that door themselves with

182
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,550
no guards in sight seems like pretty

183
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,169
slim security when you have Gotham's

184
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,580
number-one mastermind on the other side

185
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,230
of that door this here is the black mask

186
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,540
the first boss to gain control of the

187
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,250
entire city in 20 years

188
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,380
steer bat guard and bat heaven is this

189
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,730
whole movie just blatant exposition

190
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,290
here's five sins so I don't have to keep

191
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,700
bringing it up every time a random

192
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,320
character over explains who someone is

193
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,910
or why it's important why does Batman

194
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,900
have to make everything with his

195
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,280
personal stamp on it wouldn't it be

196
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,690
easier to just buy a 20 pack of small

197
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,220
Mike's on Amazon does he trademark

198
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,840
English and making money off of it also

199
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,490
Batman is successfully bugged black

200
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,260
mask's office and while this is great

201
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,610
and all why doesn't Batman just take him

202
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,910
down

203
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,660
if you don't was where the biggest

204
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,830
criminal in the entire city does

205
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,630
business why can't he just end it was he

206
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:23,870
scared of due process

207
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,020
seriously

208
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,730
waiting around dude literally started

209
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,110
walking over the moment you landed these

210
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,400
random helicopter pilots are more

211
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,960
impatient than DC trying to develop a

212
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,150
cinematic universe so since none of

213
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,530
these characters have actual superpowers

214
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,820
and that fall would kill everyone

215
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,260
involved I can only assume that these

216
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,400
three are zombies for the rest of the

217
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
runtime I'm wondering something if Red

218
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,730
Hood doesn't want to kill Batman so that

219
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,380
he can teach him a lesson later how come

220
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,340
he keeps doing things that could

221
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,170
possibly kill Batman and if he wants to

222
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,460
kill Batman he had a perfectly good

223
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,110
sniper shot to do that earlier when he

224
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,280
killed those poor bastards who were

225
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,780
about to tell Batman about him random

226
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,100
and convenient blimp is random and

227
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,710
convenient we got him Nightwing you're

228
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,850
such an asshole

229
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,290
that's impressive nothing we haven't

230
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,120
seen before exactly so why does

231
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,530
Nightwing up a Red Hood boner going on

232
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,030
right now when he and Batman do this

233
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,040
exact same nightly where exactly is this

234
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,450
footage coming from even if it was in

235
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,430
Batman's hood and he was behind Red Hood

236
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,900
at this point it wouldn't be this steady

237
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,490
because Batman will be running as well

238
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,560
as much as I hate to belabor a point and

239
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,200
still it is often exactly what to do oh

240
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,180
it would be exemplary at cinema since

241
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,310
I'm chatty it's part of my charm

242
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,660
so we're just blatantly ripping off

243
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,190
spider-man at this point like right

244
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,160
there that he sliced that cable off his

245
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,590
ankle before it went taut you don't just

246
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,930
do that that has to be practiced learn

247
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,940
you know at cable slicing before it goes

248
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,710
taut school I have an online course but

249
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,910
to get the real benefits you need to

250
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,620
train in Hong Kong under doctor whooping

251
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,540
for two years you know many knives that

252
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,800
can cut my lines not many no not many

253
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,450
are we repeating us in for repeatedly

254
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,280
repeating lines yes we are repeating us

255
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,080
in for repeatedly repeating lines even

256
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,080
when Robin was what age is this ten I

257
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,060
guess whatever he already trained super

258
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,680
hard on that cable slicing before it

259
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,120
goes taut program this kind of thing

260
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
happens more than you think apparently

261
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,570
oh come on who shoots at the top of a

262
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,520
doorway the stupid-ass move by Robin his

263
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,900
stupid ass and the problem is he

264
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,400
survives it encouraging him to do it

265
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,930
again and that's results-oriented

266
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,370
thinking that should end in his death

267
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,440
sooner or later 20 rounds a second and

268
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,830
you were still too slow I'm not so Punk

269
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,780
first off being slow wasn't the machine

270
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,620
gun guy's problem

271
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,270
it was his aim second off if you tell

272
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,620
someone that you're about to kill I'm

273
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,360
not too slow then you were officially

274
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,110
too slow also I had to take him down you

275
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,450
shattered his collarbone he is Batman

276
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,950
really trying to give lessons on not

277
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,820
hurting

278
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,500
if I see thy name is Bruce where did

279
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,030
this cape come from because when we

280
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,590
started this trip down memory lane there

281
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,990
were as Edna mode would say not text

282
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,910
Molotov cocktail I swear - these aren't

283
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,250
lightsaber rip offs we call them Chloe

284
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,170
blades discount Cyclops somehow weights

285
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,460
this long and the fight to do the only

286
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,160
thing it was brought here to do today

287
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,130
was bat mocking her I gotta say I missed

288
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,940
watching you work

289
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,830
oh we're just not even trying to hide

290
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,690
identities at this point I even keep the

291
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,880
red hood on of the Batman no one else

292
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
would know who Jason Todd is black mass

293
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,290
just wants a body we don't need your

294
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,330
head actually it didn't black mask imply

295
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,560
he did nail me and you'll electrocute

296
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,660
both of us sure we've been given the bat

297
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,280
crumbs to know that this is Robin but

298
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,050
why would anyone else think Batman cares

299
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,480
about hurting the Red Hook son are you

300
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
telling me that scumbag stole my guns

301
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,370
again black mask seems to have no other

302
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,080
purpose than to Yosemite Sam it up as

303
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,060
much as possible we've stuck in the damn

304
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,580
crossfire why does Red Hood a meet a

305
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,130
bazooka to kill black mask B need a red

306
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,830
dot to aim this thing C wave to black

307
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,750
mask and give him a head start and D

308
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,760
weight in additional 13 seconds before

309
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,590
firing also what kind of black magic is

310
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,060
he using to see this laser target have

311
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,410
you ever tried to look at your neck go

312
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,160
ahead give it a whirl

313
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,380
exactly you didn't have to kill him one

314
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,520
yes I did

315
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,650
- we're paying you a ton three we need

316
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,970
some more Joker in the movie so we're

317
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,560
pretending breaking him out is as simple

318
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
as paying off a couple guards also there

319
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,980
are so many escape attempts at Arkham

320
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,450
Asylum it's all under Batman doesn't

321
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,980
have this place constantly surveilled

322
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,170
grave robbing these are supposed to be

323
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,120
potato chips right this chip looks more

324
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,920
like an onion ring here as we clearly

325
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,570
see the Joker's finger and prison garb

326
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,910
through it may I have some water

327
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,370
you mean milk that's definitely milk I

328
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,650
was in the midst of toppling the economy

329
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,740
of Europe but you were on to me this is

330
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,210
the beginning of an entire five minutes

331
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,010
of narrated flashback I mean there's

332
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,150
exposition and then there's being

333
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,440
tricked into thinking you're watching an

334
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,790
animated film when you're actually just

335
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,560
listening to a book on tape Batman who

336
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,850
we've been told time after time in these

337
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,590
movies is one step ahead of everybody is

338
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,180
amazing and knows all is somehow

339
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,250
surprised by a two-bit Joker henchman

340
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,260
and is dropped by one punch so that this

341
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,070
death no family can happen as you know I

342
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,690
achieve this by bathing the rejuvenating

343
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,850
waters of the Lazarus Pit as you know

344
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,950
any time a character says as you know I

345
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,240
yell at the screen and why are you

346
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,119
telling them I'm fun

347
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,459
also the Lazarus Pit is essentially DC's

348
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,350
ultimate death machina therefore there

349
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,819
are rarely any stakes because you can

350
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,499
just go to Rachel's place and get your

351
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:56,329
life back it has long been rumored that

352
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,699
it is capable of an even greater feat to

353
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,679
raise the dead it's called the Lazarus

354
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,899
Pit I'm guessing that's for a reason he

355
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,949
burns their very kingdom you protect the

356
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,689
story was so long even Batman checked

357
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,549
out his life and his death are my

358
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:12,859
greatest failure do you remember how he

359
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,539
was when I found him haven't we already

360
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,459
gone over this a few times were way too

361
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,019
many minutes wasted on moody morning

362
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,819
Batman in this movie glad to see Gotham

363
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,589
employing a multi Zeppelin attack during

364
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:22,609
this Joker diversion

365
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,739
how did nobody know until now the city's

366
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:26,029
most dangerous criminal had escaped

367
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,799
Arkham Asylum I mean they should have

368
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,999
some sort of tracker on this guy at this

369
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:35,319
point don't you think

370
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,609
why is he repeating the same thing he

371
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,769
said earlier here more flashy maître D

372
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,689
than motorcycle fetish it was barely

373
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,369
funny the first time is repeating it's

374
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,139
supposed to be clever but what I really

375
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,889
wanted was an audience I'm sorry that

376
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,399
seems to imply that you organized this

377
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,559
little clambake it most definitely does

378
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,879
which makes zero sense

379
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,769
even if red hoods eventual plan was to

380
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,999
get the Joker broken out so he could

381
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,379
kill him how did he know black masks

382
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,519
would eventually be the one to break him

383
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,339
out here's to warm memories later

384
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,659
finally lightning after trying several

385
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:06,979
times while the killer says something

386
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:08,929
crazy a metaphorical cliche I get that

387
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,159
it landed on a person instead of the

388
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,229
actual gasoline but as stringent as that

389
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:13,879
area was that entire truck would have

390
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,600
gone up in flames

391
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,309
instantly either way seriously the

392
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,139
batplane has fire retardant its plane is

393
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,639
so thin how does he have room for this

394
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,739
also let's say Batman had Richard

395
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,269
Dreyfuss ghost guiding him and he was

396
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,739
actually good enough to make that shot

397
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,089
there's still no way enough of that

398
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,350
stuff is getting in there to put out

399
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,970
that fire in fact because it's in motion

400
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,499
most of what got in there would end up

401
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,539
on the back wall anyway Batman has pink

402
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,129
foam that will shoot out of his jet if

403
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,779
he randomly comes across a fire but he

404
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:36,769
doesn't have a way to prevent the

405
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,539
Batmobile from being vandalized well

406
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,279
Batman stop trying to tie red hoods legs

407
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,779
already isn't there another way to take

408
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,159
him down that doesn't involve lassoing

409
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,479
him which he's shown to be able to

410
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,369
escape time and again did that knife

411
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:51,109
just go through concrete help Jason so

412
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,479
he wore a mask under a mask that doesn't

413
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,159
seem practical also was this supposed to

414
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,959
be a reveal because Batman has figured

415
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,159
out on at least three different

416
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,750
occasions in this movie that the little

417
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,490
Robin Hood was Jason Tom why would he

418
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,750
have his hood set with explosives

419
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,100
especially considering he had the

420
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
trigger on him at all times what bothers

421
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,880
you more that your greatest failure has

422
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,710
returned from the grave or that I've

423
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,300
become a better Batman than you

424
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,040
rumor has it Christian Bale had the same

425
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
conversation with George Clooney Jesus

426
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,100
Christ man so many characters have

427
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,420
crashed through windows in this movie

428
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,100
that it deserves a bonus round but we

429
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,870
just got done with a window bonus round

430
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,190
and I'm worried about repeating myself

431
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,770
also seen does not contain a lapdance we

432
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,030
know that they both got in here through

433
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,740
the window but where exactly is the door

434
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,020
to this bathroom is the window the only

435
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,400
entry I guess what you gotta go you

436
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,790
gotta go

437
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,860
all I've ever wanted to do is kill him

438
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,740
but if I do that if I allow myself to go

439
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,500
down into that place I'll never come

440
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,570
back yeah sure whatever I think it's

441
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,160
more about DC killing Batman's best

442
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,840
villain than it is your deep dark place

443
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,090
that you can never come back for why I'm

444
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,950
not talking about killing penguin or

445
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,080
scarecrow or dent they've killed a lot

446
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
of people as well but you know semantics

447
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,130
if you will kill this psychotic piece of

448
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,350
filth I will Jason actually thinks that

449
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,970
Batman has no other option than to kill

450
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,170
him to stop him from killing Joker

451
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,520
Batman suit is filled with so many

452
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,290
deterrence and Jason knows this that

453
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,790
it's silly he thinks this will go down

454
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,089
the way he planned it I have a countdown

455
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,320
and not just have them explode

456
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,820
immediately why does everyone give these

457
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,400
fun guys so many opportunities to escape

458
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,930
the fact that Joker is still alive after

459
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,400
being right next to the explosives and

460
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,380
also pinned down perfectly by pieces of

461
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,000
the building it leveled is so much

462
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,770
convenience that 7-eleven wants to stock

463
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,900
it on the shelves Nightwing remember me

464
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,460
it looked like I was gonna be a part of

465
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,630
this movie there for a second at the

466
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,740
beginning and then I sprained an ankle

467
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,380
and wasn't anymore good times this

468
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,030
doesn't change anything it doesn't

469
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,800
change anything at all well good thing

470
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
we spent an entire movie on it then

471
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,630
