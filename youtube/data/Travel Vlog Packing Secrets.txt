27
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,750

Owen

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,620
since Francine was born which is true

30
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,760
then Turkish Airlines called

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,560
and they're like hey why don't we fly

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,060
you somewhere and you can spend some

33
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,890
time with Owen I was like that's a great

34
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,459
idea but I don't have any free time so

35
