1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,670
ah help the battle between heaven and

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,860
hell has waged eternal I'm not sure if

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,330
there's a worse way to start your movie

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,190
than with narration and a fake bird all

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,100
the docks blow it needs now it's a great

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,380
soldier just one great soldier it's like

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,029
the Bad News Bears for demons sure

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,500
everyone on the team sucks but if you

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,240
can get one person on that team that's

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,400
good it will turn them into a force just

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,199
ask the Los Angeles Angels you know the

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,000
one located in generics Ville on Main

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,950
Street close to the unspecific ocean

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,329
also though this is supposedly a

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,100
military airbase in Hong Kong but this

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,809
is clearly a small commercial jet being

17
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,370
operated by American Eagle which is a

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,379
subsidiary of American Airlines also

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,210
American airline this guy leads with a

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,890
kick then proceeds to blow away the

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,450
entire control room in a hail of bullets

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,860
and editing I would have led with the

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,449
gun but when will you ever get to use

24
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,980
that sweet move again right how is the

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,750
airport not on super lockdown after all

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,430
the machine gunfire in the tower why are

27
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,410
the deep planing anyone right now pretty

28
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,359
effective missile I will admit but is

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,100
there any reason you had the ninja break

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,960
into air traffic control and fire the

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,189
missile from there I get that there was

32
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,659
proximity and a height advantage and

33
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,310
shooting from here but you had night

34
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,170
vision an Xbox controller gadget thinks

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,310
and here in Hong Kong

36
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,140
the city with the most skyscrapers per

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,820
square mile than any other on earth you

38
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,990
couldn't find an easier place to find

39
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,630
this missile from brought to you by the

40
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,100
studio that would somehow be able to

41
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,270
fund a whole Lord of the Rings trilogy

42
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,799
this movie does the ultra cheap route

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,970
and doesn't even bother to blow up a

44
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,680
real airplane fire effects borrowed from

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,450
Mortal Kombat or borrow what do you come

46
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,710
up with something that's cheesy and lame

47
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,630
thinks it's actually edgy as an old for

48
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,759
cool oh yeah introduction after effects

49
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,020
it's always a welcome sight when the

50
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,400
actor playing the title character isn't

51
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,079
the first name you see and it's an even

52
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,520
better sight when that first actor's

53
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,770
name is John Leguizamo yep the Martin

54
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,420
Sheen because despite his established

55
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,860
greatness he was still several months

56
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,270
shy of being offered the West Wing and

57
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,220
everyone's got bills yeah also the fire

58
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,020
tornado metal opening credits of hate

59
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,270
made me throw up three times but also is

60
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,340
the new name of my band so this entire

61
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,990
credits sequence music and all is like

62
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,579
reliving the 90s all over again this is

63
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,049
what Bill Clinton dreams but dust

64
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,369
brothers masturbate to this credit

65
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,140
sequence no not together that would be

66
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,240
the Chemical Brothers

67
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,799
it's like this movie saw the opening

68
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,360
credits for seven two years earlier and

69
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,500
decided to go for the middle school

70
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,569
version of that also holy balls seven

71
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:10,830
percent of this entire movie is this

72
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,959
long opening fire tornado credits hey

73
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,650
Pew mark a dot Z dot dip a not for the

74
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,120
movie but for having to middle initials

75
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,640
the hell is that about dog it's not the

76
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,350
problem I don't doubt that desperate man

77
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,030
would do anything to attain wealth and

78
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,620
power and would sell their souls for it

79
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,730
I just don't think they believe a

80
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,350
cigarette smoking clown demon could

81
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,370
provide it they tried to 60 minutes

82
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,750
shadow this guy but it's clearly a

83
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,550
member of the Insane Clown Posse also

84
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,440
why is this asshole in shadows how do

85
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,730
you properly light a room so that

86
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,260
Satan's henchmen can be properly cloaked

87
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,670
during a conversation what's the point

88
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,410
anyway I guess they asked John Leguizamo

89
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,430
to do his best penguin from Batman

90
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,170
Returns voice or else this is just

91
00:02:49,170 --> 00:03:00,570
highway robbery here were you just

92
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,040
talking about this guy earlier why not

93
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,360
bring this up then you might be

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,890
wondering why does it matter but they

95
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,390
spent this whole scene talking about

96
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,440
building a weapon that Martin Sheen

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,450
already knew we had to build and this is

98
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:19,140
a PS why do you want him okay so how do

99
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,430
you want it not seeing how that's

100
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,170
funnier and it's actually less likely to

101
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,459
get me the answer I was looking for with

102
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,110
the original question you dick this

103
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,940
headline should read USA Today

104
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,769
completely abuses the increased kerning

105
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,180
function on this double-decker front

106
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,579
page headline also I capitalized all the

107
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,019
words in this headline except blow up

108
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,600
also also again I remind you that was an

109
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,980
American Eagle jet not a British

110
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,230
airliner but whatever USA Today everyone

111
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,370
knows your reputation has been shot

112
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,750
since that you've jailed erroneous

113
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,340
headline bull and back to the future to

114
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,440
also times 3-under this white dudes

115
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,790
picture there's a caption about Michael

116
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,049
Jordan and under this white woman's

117
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,190
picture there's a caption about Will

118
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,019
Smith so maybe get out happened earlier

119
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,579
when we thought this magic there's been

120
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,049
lurking around for a while now though

121
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,280
this is the first time he's glowed

122
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,260
bright green but my point is this guy

123
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,570
the airport Killzone was supposed to be

124
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,549
clear of civilians I know we just got

125
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,290
news about the civilians and he's mad

126
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,329
about it but didn't he see the civilians

127
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,310
with his high-tech headgear earlier or

128
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,750
does his headgear only detect bad guys

129
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,280
this she's got a gun in her underwear

130
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,900
Sean is all about titillating you and

131
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,430
has nothing to do with the story that

132
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,720
sees this guy soon becoming an

133
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,820
all-powerful hell agent

134
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,170
what the fuck is this why does he have

135
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,150
an ashtray in his pet scorpion bowl it's

136
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,500
like how can we make the Martin Sheen

137
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,450
characters seem more evil I know let's

138
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,040
show that he has pet scorpions and he

139
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,300
puts out cigarettes in an ashtray

140
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,370
located inside the bowl this guy I give

141
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,440
zero fucks about scorpion stings and

142
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,780
lung cancer casual tarantula fun come on

143
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,000
son this is top priority a little on the

144
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,100
nose but honestly I'd rather watch more

145
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,900
on the nose scorpion attack imagery than

146
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,520
most of the plot I've seen of this thing

147
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,900
so far you know we've been awesome

148
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,430
seeing how Simmons all by himself

149
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,500
infiltrated this top-secret North Korean

150
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,090
weapons facility without anyone seeing

151
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,570
him I really don't think there was

152
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,710
enough time for president bartlet and

153
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,300
julie cooper-nichol to get off the boat

154
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,650
they just casually walked out while the

155
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,060
damn thing exploded and it's not like

156
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,170
they had Wonder Woman's invisible jet

157
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,550
waiting to take them out of here before

158
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,130
this place blew yeah you know for

159
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,570
someone that was ambushed burned to

160
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,190
death and woke up in the rainy worst

161
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,780
part of the city from Blade Runner this

162
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,550
guy sure he's kind of an asshole he sets

163
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,800
out to reclaim his humanity okay sure

164
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,450
but he saw his reflection in the water

165
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,920
he knows his face looks like an avocado

166
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,630
had sex with an older more disgusting

167
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,310
avocado doesn't he know his lady is not

168
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,960
only not going to recognize him but also

169
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,670
who likely to call the cops and probably

170
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,290
a priest at least make the phone call

171
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,850
the thing tries to make an Fantastic

172
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,140
Four were before scaring your kids and

173
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,690
of course Toto can still smell his old

174
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,580
master years later and through the layer

175
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,370
of burned reincarnated skin Wanda and

176
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,110
Terry end up hiring the clown makes

177
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,970
hooker jokes drinks smokes and has

178
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,830
jagged teeth for this birthday party are

179
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,270
they blinded to this because of some

180
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,000
sort of spell or something Oh imagine

181
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,830
being the guy that did the CGI on the

182
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,330
fart for the scene like would you ever

183
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,550
even tell anyone also this front reminds

184
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,350
me since will never send this saying

185
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,330
year's John Leguizamo classic the pest

186
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,280
can I just go ahead and transfer 50 sins

187
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,780
from that movie to the scene right here

188
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,040
it's a bit of a complicated sin

189
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,930
retirement account math and it's rarely

190
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,430
invoked but I feel like this scene

191
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,130
deserves it okay skidmark

192
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,750
sometimes sin retirement accounts

193
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,730
compound in Chris Daly and that's why

194
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,680
this is getting an additional 100 55

195
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,220
cents

196
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,590
going to add 478 more for the visuals

197
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,530
and 1763 more sins for this movie being

198
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,660
a dick good God if I were Satan I would

199
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,700
be embarrassed at this CGI hell escape

200
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,410
he calls home call a fucking decorator

201
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,400
or Stan Winston and get this cleaned up

202
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,840
by army you can see one again so in this

203
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,580
flashback al is reminded of his deal

204
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,470
with malbolge ax but why does this

205
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,060
process make him forget that the first

206
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,560
place is it so violator has something to

207
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,090
do it's hard to believe that hell and

208
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,590
over millions of years hasn't perfected

209
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:54,940
this a way win only killed him because

210
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,620
the clown told him to and the clown

211
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,210
works for you and your first command is

212
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,650
to have him kill win you could have had

213
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,150
win killed in any number of other ways

214
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,820
he's thinking is your guardian angel as

215
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,930
long as we don't have to think of you as

216
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,370
Luigi ever ever again

217
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,780
he died a patriot do you want to know

218
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,120
what year he died you because of course

219
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,889
there's a small group of poser Satanists

220
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,419
doing some rituals here tonight as I'm

221
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:15,039
sure there are and every cemetery around

222
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:26,919
the world every night what what no I've

223
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,419
got to know what is this place that I

224
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:36,520
have found what is roll credits people

225
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,419
can still die how do you call it when

226
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,860
the fart clown spits out the rules of

227
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,150
the film's universe instead of normal

228
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,979
dialogue clowns position John Leguizamo

229
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,440
position so does this locket with Wallis

230
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,550
pictures supposed to give him some sort

231
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,260
of extra motivation or power it's

232
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,639
literally the only reason why he dug up

233
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,320
his own grave so my answer would be yes

234
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,729
even though I don't understand why he

235
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:55,840
needs it and it's stupid

236
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,330
I mean even Tron is pissed off at these

237
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,280
special effects this free stuff's gonna

238
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,380
come in handy when I get my hands on way

239
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,539
glad you could remind yourself and us if

240
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,490
that fact my IQ dropped about a hundred

241
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,720
points after just 30 minutes of this

242
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,460
movie so I did not understand that until

243
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,340
you said so I am Kali Oscar oh that's

244
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,289
all you need to know from now it would

245
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,820
be devastating to the movies runtime if

246
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,440
I told you anything more he pushes this

247
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,180
guy to the left then goes around him on

248
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,070
the right only to turn left why not just

249
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,780
not push the guy at all and go left

250
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,430
sometimes putting words on your screen

251
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,630
to tell us where we are it's actually

252
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
more confusing than saying nothing at

253
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,169
North Korean biochemical operation

254
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,760
really paid off that one from five years

255
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,560
ago it just happens to coincide with our

256
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,029
hero's murder weird that you're exposing

257
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,890
about that just after he's come back to

258
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,029
Earth from Hell to kill you did the

259
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,260
screenwriter give you a heads up

260
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,810
now we

261
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,729
weapons in place to disperse heat-16

262
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,070
over half of this got for second clothes

263
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,860
so why does your virus simulation show

264
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,690
the entire world being infected if the

265
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,130
simulation is accurate you better be in

266
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,420
some sort of underground bunker when

267
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,790
this hits flappy cape jump then dragging

268
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,560
two victims spoopy spent so much on

269
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
terrible bright-green farts CGI it

270
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
couldn't afford to film actual action

271
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,480
scenes that might have been fun to watch

272
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,400
also the clown left and said he'd return

273
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,529
when spawns armor had hardened so he

274
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,480
immediately attacks a place with soft

275
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,640
armor no Joe just had a birthday didn't

276
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,350
she his terrible facial hair part of the

277
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,089
uniform for this place Sheen looks like

278
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:12,260
he's auditioning for West Bentleys

279
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,029
Hunger Games role and DB's goatee is

280
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,500
getting harassing phone calls from a

281
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,330
dozen better film goatees this is the

282
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,070
headquarters of the elite military

283
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,720
outfit he used to work for and that had

284
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
him killed and you're telling me he

285
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,630
scaled the building a few stories to

286
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,400
this point and no one saw nor stopped

287
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,680
him what year was it cameras exist in

288
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,570
this universe right how much did these

289
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,089
spawn Cape CGI transitions cost you how

290
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,470
much better would this movie be if you'd

291
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,300
spent all that money on hiring a better

292
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,310
writer yep

293
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,320
also no one is shooting his ass yet you

294
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,240
sent me to college Jason movie

295
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,890
subliminally advertises Jason goes to

296
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,420
hell four years after it came out

297
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,100
[Music]

298
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,870
no one is still shooting his ass yet you

299
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,790
know about cyan the greenish bluish

300
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,860
color yes I'm aware of it do you know

301
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,450
about magenta she shoots guns at the

302
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,010
dead guy from hell and he runs to hide

303
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,420
from them even though I don't think

304
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,860
bullets will matter much and the battle

305
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,330
spawn has ahead of him didn't the clown

306
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,560
tell him that he could only die by

307
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,270
getting his head chopped off what good

308
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,430
is I'm gonna do I mean unless you have

309
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,500
that vagina dentata think oh you meant

310
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,570
killing luckily I wore my bitings go

311
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,100
belt which specifically protects me from

312
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,930
getting kicked in the balls you know I

313
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,040
could have used a belt like this during

314
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
six through eleventh grade where you're

315
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,230
going every day's New York City Fashion

316
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,230
Week you don't have the guts what what

317
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,430
is it about Al's character that makes

318
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,450
you think he doesn't have the guts to

319
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,370
kill people dude is known for killing

320
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,720
fools wasn't his mission to kill Jason

321
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,459
win I'd say he totally failed that

322
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,020
mission my favorite part about the wrong

323
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,970
dead guy turned hell warrior superhero

324
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,620
movie is the scene where he done all the

325
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,970
shooting with the machine guns in both

326
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,380
hands that's exactly how I would have

327
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,790
pictured hell demons fighting actually

328
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,529
so spawn disappears in an act of

329
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,209
self-preservation that he doesn't even

330
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,130
appear to control but then he reappears

331
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,720
in the same spot for absolutely no

332
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,080
reason

333
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,700
heaping piles of bull on the out

334
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,110
this is like that Daniel Craig weapon in

335
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,940
Cowboys and Aliens I mean getting

336
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,770
magnets man now that he's on the run

337
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,240
from all the bullets where the because

338
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,430
that goddamn magical cloak even as a

339
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,779
reflex it should be working

340
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,970
it'll be seated during the exciting cops

341
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,500
fruitlessly shoot at spawn while he

342
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,420
slowly walks on the ledge scene even as

343
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,100
someone who was just demanding more

344
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,220
cloak action what the fuck was that I

345
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,029
don't care what kind of intricate

346
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,230
labyrinths the paramedics and

347
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,430
firefighters have created with their

348
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,290
cars there cannot be a private place for

349
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,670
the violator and Jason to have a

350
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,440
conversation here not only is she his

351
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,209
ex-girlfriend she's also actively

352
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,770
reporting and lecturing on the chemical

353
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,390
abuses that occurred because he went on

354
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,200
that mission that killed him

355
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,240
coincidences this strong only happened

356
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,820
in comics and comic based movies the

357
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,970
world

358
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,830
introspection look.we excitement she

359
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,990
brought her daughter and her dog and the

360
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,850
dogs tennis ball to her super important

361
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,950
lecture movie should never have time for

362
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:51,680
this giving orders to win way before

363
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:03,200
spawn was even spawn true or false did

364
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,670
you or did you not overly complicate

365
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,270
this from playing man whose past dog

366
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,940
kicking we do totally so spaz I spend

367
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,200
one second looking for him when he can

368
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,370
walk home what's the worst that could

369
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,820
happen

370
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,410
spawns decision to go back to the alley

371
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,150
he arrived in coincides perfectly with

372
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,800
this hateful homeless guy beating the

373
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
kid that one time offered spawn a soda

374
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,370
man along circular storytelling it's the

375
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,470
best we had a long circular storytelling

376
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,300
it's the best that's bad another hero

377
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,010
has a heart of gold cliche even though

378
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,390
this hero was a hell demon with almost

379
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,070
no redeeming qualities as per your

380
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,020
orders director win if your vital signs

381
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,120
flatline for any reason the device will

382
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,640
uplink and detonate the heat-16 bombs no

383
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,100
one would dare kill you so how do you

384
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,779
spread the word about that do you go on

385
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,149
TV explain your evil plan and say don't

386
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,589
kill me my heart has hooked up to all

387
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:53,300
the bombs or do people just know within

388
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,649
5 seconds of meeting you that you're

389
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,120
probably the type of guy that hooks up

390
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,360
detonators to its heart

391
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,279
it's time the Lightning told me so I'm

392
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,309
gonna cut 50 pieces and Mail you Tavi

393
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,170
steak oh no the mailing is the worst

394
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,989
part but down by dog movie inspires the

395
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,850
entire John wick franchise if you are

396
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,470
this powerful all along why did you ever

397
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,290
waste time on that clown bull dog kick

398
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,299
hey seriously with a demon this powerful

399
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,889
why does malbolge you even need spawn to

400
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,350
lead his army where is cape really spawn

401
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,860
movie Jesus pose really really I don't

402
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,360
mean to invoke the pest more than it

403
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,160
needs to be but how did John Leguizamo

404
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,230
survive in 1997 playing these two

405
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,149
characters this is some serious view up

406
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,189
for life type of to inhabit your spawn

407
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,079
but that doesn't mean you have to be

408
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,670
what they want something tells me you're

409
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,529
about to dump some exposition you needed

410
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,660
to dump half an hour ago Al Simmons knew

411
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,369
that violence only makes for more pain

412
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,079
and suffering no matter which side gives

413
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,670
the orders he tried to leave off killing

414
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,079
give himself a second chance

415
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,699
we saw none of these character traits in

416
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,319
alla before he died sure he was upset

417
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,790
about killing the innocent civilians but

418
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,470
he didn't have any qualms about killing

419
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,049
in general your old life is gone except

420
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,610
that things someone said to Martin Sheen

421
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,839
to get him to sign on to this film

422
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,970
somehow made in the script spawn keeps

423
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,470
his weapons cash in an easily accessible

424
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,420
unlocked area where any homeless dude

425
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,559
could find it and steal it

426
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,509
you've been using your armor only by

427
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,629
reflex you must learn to control it if

428
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:12,980
only I could have run into you sooner we

429
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,269
could have figured out this whole thing

430
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,850
to get oh we did meet sooner you said I

431
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,209
was on a need-to-know basis no hero just

432
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,769
begins to learn something but becomes an

433
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,629
instant expert in seconds cliche take

434
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,549
care of your powers when you drain them

435
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,529
you'd I won't be needing these

436
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,089
I know discount obi-wan told spawn that

437
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,249
the guns were useless but he didn't seem

438
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:32,720
to learn anything about how he was going

439
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
to win without killing people he learned

440
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,809
how to get horny and he learned stuff

441
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:40,209
about his chains but that was about it

442
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,829
clown he's so full of great pop-culture

443
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,509
references including movies starring one

444
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,129
of his co-stars but over the years how

445
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,449
has this guy watched all these movies

446
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,949
does he go to movie theaters or rent

447
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:50,240
stuff at Blockbuster to pass the time

448
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,919
when he's not middle Manning he stands

449
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,419
up from the crash of the spawn cycle to

450
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,649
face the imminent attack of the klom

451
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,629
truck and I hate myself for typing any

452
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,160
of that movie steals the Bruce Willis

453
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,009
from die hard to reading secure files

454
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,889
this 1997 computer is so helpful giving

455
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,329
him audio explanations of what's

456
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,040
happening at all times

457
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,090
man this movie this motherfucker is the

458
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,710
most annoying clown since Pennywise went

459
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,480
through a slam poetry phase what would

460
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,980
happen if violator just killed Jason

461
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,510
right now I realized that means that

462
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,860
they've broken their bargain but really

463
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,839
one of the consequences a blow for this

464
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,820
movie to actually explain that you join

465
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,330
Hills Army or she dies I thought he

466
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,339
already agreed to join in lead Hills

467
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,710
army back when he first went on dead did

468
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,350
I miss read that scene movie

469
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,970
subliminally advertises Jason goes to

470
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,880
hell four years after it came out you

471
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,740
would get a soul and kickstart the

472
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,960
Apocalypse Now or kickstart the West

473
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,940
Wing or kickstart the wall street or

474
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,040
kickstart the badlands is this guy I've

475
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,510
been doing this whole time if he can

476
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,920
help then why hasn't he been helping

477
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,390
movie combines darkness with horrible

478
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,160
CGI and editing to give us this

479
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,600
climactic battle this is the kind of

480
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,339
Jewish that newline cranked out back

481
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:04,700
then

482
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,080
it's Mortal Kombat's fault for being

483
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,610
halfway decent but they turned out this

484
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,440
stuff with no regret it is physically

485
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,420
painful to watch this movie no one

486
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,920
thought this was terrible enough to cut

487
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,810
or improve before the movie came out if

488
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,100
you could quantify the amount of

489
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,170
whatever this movie's manufactured you

490
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,640
could weaponize it and kill millions of

491
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,589
people with indifference I mean big

492
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,330
fighter had better graphics than this it

493
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,190
cannot be stressed enough this is worth

494
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,140
another 10,000 sins I think

495
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,420
well apparently spawn can do that it's

496
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,250
sort of an accidental ex machina oh and

497
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,930
he knows how to fly too he learned some

498
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,610
real intricate in the last minute of

499
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,520
this battle cyan screams but whatever

500
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,690
she's screaming about doesn't appear

501
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,940
until well after she yells that's kind

502
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,560
of both right in addition to naming your

503
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,510
kids cyan don't know why violator is

504
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,220
still alive and don't care there were

505
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,780
entirely too many fireplace shenanigans

506
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,950
taking place in this movie I'm halfway

507
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,480
expecting Sirius Black to show up and

508
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,190
warn Harry about some danger but for

509
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,660
someone to use the flu network to go to

510
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,220
the Quidditch Cup for the past five

511
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,650
years I unwittingly participated in

512
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,630
Jason Wynn's illegal manipulation of the

513
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,060
asic do you need a fucking lawyer right

514
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,589
now you don't start spilling all your in

515
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,790
front of the house at a crime scene

516
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,270
spawn has stopped now bulges plans to

517
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,189
destroy the earth did this demon really

518
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:12,199
depend on one asshole to carry out his

519
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,579
plan I thought a bunch of other people

520
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,260
in the world were banking on selling

521
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,000
their souls for wealth and power but the

522
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,050
only guy who could help him with his

523
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,240
plan was Martin Sheen

524
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,450
you know where you love her and cannot

525
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,040
live without her

526
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,900
[Music]

527
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,240
I wanted to ask you a couple of

528
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,830
questions while I had you here I'm

529
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,030
interested in selling my youngest

530
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,950
daughter into slavery as sanctioned in

531
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,370
exodus 21:7 she's a Georgetown sophomore

532
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,050
speaks fluent Italian always cleared the

533
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,060
table when it was her turn what would a

534
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,610
good price for her be take out US

535
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,520
tariffs for $100 it takes a steady hand

536
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:01,910
because if you touch the side goodbye

537
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,550
close I have been falling for 30 minutes

538
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,520
you look like Freddy Krueger face

539
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,990
topographical map of Utah this is even

540
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,400
more painful than it looks

541
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,620
you see you've been using your armor

542
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,650
only by reflex you must learn to control

543
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,220
it

544
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,440
it has trillions of neural connections

545
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,030
once again things that could have been

546
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,000
brought to my attention yesterday

547
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,860
present me

548
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,710
120 precursor orbs for each Power Cell I

549
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,000
can do
