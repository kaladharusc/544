seen my collaboration with damn drops

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,250
you'll recognize the restaurant I'm

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,230
currently at this is the mix the whole

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,079
time at the Anaheim Convention Center

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,730
it's the place where I had my very last

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,219
murder and what a burger it was now we

15

good right this I am I am cheating a

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,850
little bit today for sure but the

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,480
purpose here is to remember I can't eat

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,270
a fraction of that I I miss being able

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,969
to eat an entire meal

25
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,330
one day one day again but today's gonna

26
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,130
be a kind of a slow day this is the

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,020
first day of VidCon for me but VidCon

28
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,030
doesn't officially start until Thursday

29
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,830
Wednesday I think my first panels on

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,720
Thursday we came in early so that we

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,310

32

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,250
I I mean I should look at this in a very

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,390
positive way that's a lot of calories

37
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,810
I'm leaving on the plate you're killing

38
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,460
it though oh yeah I'm gonna eat all of

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,090
