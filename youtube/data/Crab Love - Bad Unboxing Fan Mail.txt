8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,740

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,300
ordinary boxes

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,239
hopefully with the ordinary comes the

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,530
extra ordinary we got a hat that says

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,950
come and a t-shirt that says video games

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,940
there's two things I lack in life

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,399
little crispy it's past Easter at this

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,440
point but I'm gonna take a bite out of a

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
little double crispy he's so cute isn't

17

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,920

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,500
bumps we got some bunny ears every now

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
and again I have to fan myself off a

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
little bit cuz he gets hot in the

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,799
recording studio I love this a bubble

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:15,110

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,409
cute animals nothing sharp this last

25
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,970
item kind of worries me a bit because

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,890
you send me some very nice things here

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,990
and this one's called joking around

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,390
Window Cling it's meant to look like a

29
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,820
rock was thrown through a window and I

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,079
don't think that's very nice I think

31
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,360
that's kind of a mean prank if you were

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,460
to put that on my window I would be very

33
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,079
upset oh no rock went through my window

34
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,850
overall a very good package smells a bit

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,189
like Cologne it's got a bunch of pink

36
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,579
styrofoam inside get two now your bagel

37
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,450
boy okay don't bug boy or don't bagel

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,960
boy open inside it sounds like terms

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,000
sounds like turds alright you shat in a

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,890
couple red cups then you take those cups

41
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,140
together you put it in a box it cost you

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,759
probably $10 and shipping

43
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,610
remember I said no gross stuff this

44
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,810
better not be fucked

45
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,050
gross you absolute fucking trash can of

46
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,300
a human being is that why I'm smelling

47
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,370
cologne on everything is because you

48
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,170
shit in a cup and you don't want me to

49
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,620
smell the shit not okay me be a man okay

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,390
what I thought was in here was a urinal

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,310
cake I thought it was a urinal cake

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,800
because I saw a little bit of blue it

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,660
was like a weird blue sort of like

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,530
spongy sort of material it's not that

55
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,540
it's it's still it's hmm

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,040
it still stinks ah but it's like a book

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,570
it's a bagel he said it was a bagel boy

58
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,930

59
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,150

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,500

61
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,200
extraordinary out there on the outside

62
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,569
of this one is this fragile liquid but

63
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,769
