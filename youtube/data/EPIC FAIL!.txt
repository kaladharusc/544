7
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:59,120

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,940
my hotel room was creepy I had a bed in my bathroom

12
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,780
that's a pretty high level of creepy we stayed at a fancy hotel last night

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,090
because we went online and they had like the deep discounted last minute rates

14
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,550
but like it was great i'm not complaining

15
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,180
it's a great hotel room

16
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,890
ok

17
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,010

18
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,350
and two hours he has

19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,450
I'm sorry that it's not i am now in case he flies at eleven is two more hours

20
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,420
left to expand ok because of childhood illnesses to LA - I believe that this is

21
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,330
sort of like tulo is the hostess at our restaurant

22
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,330
I volunteered to be in it thanks so much

23
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:21,530
you've never been to Santa Monica they have this amazing adult jungle gym with

24
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,940
like rings here and ropes for climbing here and pull up bars and stuff my

25
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,290
favorite is this wildly underutilized set of monkey bars here and each of

26
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,650
these rungs like from this one to this one

27
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,459
it's an 8 foot gap I don't you think i can jump that highlight how do you think

28
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:42,049
you can hot and if I fail if I don't do it i'm going to edit it out and make it

29
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,410
look like I did it perfectly the first time but i just wanted to be honest and

30
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,410
you use special effects to make it look like i can do them

31
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:59,599
yeah okay all right for both my arms out of their sockets to help out that swing

32
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:12,829
some good swing you got going to take a donkey com d can't fully one just that

33
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,160
was the first time I mind is blown right now

34
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,910
that was not anything that was the first try so you're just gonna edit the video

35
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,910
to make it look with you and her

36
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,840
it's all about that swing but release hi

37
