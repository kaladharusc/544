1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,100
Guys, I made a huge mistake!

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:10,600
I went on the DARK WEB (dark web, dark web, dark web, dark web, dark web)

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,660
But it's not my fault!

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,940
I was roped into it by another YouTuber. He put (Very Scary) in the title. I was curious.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,260
What can I say? I wanted to know more.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,160
I ended up buying a package from the dark web. And I will unbox it....

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,400
At the end of this video.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,820
*Intro music wubs*

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,640
But first! Let's go through what inspired me to do this.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,080
*More intro music wubbing*

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,980
GUY: Okay, guys we just got it o--

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,380
*Pewds laughs* Sorry, I'm already nitpicking but-- *laughs more*

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,380
I just noticed this.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,940
It's open. You don't need to cut it again. It's open. It's 100% open.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,560
Look at that! He's cutting nothing! *Wheeze*

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,080
Oh man....

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,420
PEWDS: Anyway, let's watch the video. 
GUY: Okay guys, we just got it open.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,320
PEWDS: Damn, he actually got it open. That must have been really tricky.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,060
'Cause whoever sent it to him through the dark web did a great job packaging it.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,800
With regular home tape.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,560
GUY: Yo, what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,420
PEWDS: What's going on guys!

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,980
Is every YouTuber in 2018 the same person, just... slightly different?

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,220
I mean, yeah, obviously. It's always been like that.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,280
GUY: Well, if you guys have been keeping up with the previous videos you guys know about this whole entire Angela situation guys.

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,460
PEWDS: Of course, who doesn't know about the Angela situation? Everyone's talking about it, it's like the Shane Dawson series.

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,780
Every YouTuber is discussing this thing.

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:45,100
GUY: The Angela doll has still not shown up guys. I have no idea where the hell it went since we played that one-man hide-and-seek, guys.

29
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,140
I'm sure it's gonna turn up eventually, but guys, it's been like three days now and I still have not seen it.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,100
So, I guess until it shows up guys, we cannot make any more videos about it.

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,040
PEWDS: GUYS! The Angelina situation is totally out of control, and I know you guys really want to see

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,260
what's going on with this Angelina thing and guys like I'm trying to not drag out this video at all for you guys.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,400
All I want is to entertain you guys, and make sure I get the best possible content for you guys.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,320
GUY: You're gonna want to go watch the previous four videos on this channel guys.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,100
PEWDS: I'm gonna go uhh... take my chances on that one. *Laughs* I think I'll just watch this one.

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,460
GUY: Three weeks ago, I ordered this dark web mystery box guys for about a thousand dollars.

37
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,620
PEWDS: OH, A THOUSAND DOLLARS?

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,520
SURE!!

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,220
I like how he just proudly puts some prize on it, like, $1000! I ordered it!

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,700
GUY: Here's a picture of what it looks like. It looks absolutely crazy, even crazier when I saw it in real life. But, basically inside of it--

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,120
PEWDS: Jesus Christ, just get on with it.

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,240
Alright, so basically this guy bought a package from the dark web. You've probably seen these videos in your

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,260
recommended tab, if not, don't click on them. They're never anything interesting. I saw one where it said

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,260
I bought a hard drive from the dark web and guess what?

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,960
It was just a hard drive! *Laughs*

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:10,720
Buying a hard drive from the dark web, ooh. Oh, wow, it was an actual hard drive. Oh, spooky....

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,960
It's a cursed hard drive because it's from the dark web, ooh, spooky....

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,040
GUY: Basically the dark web guys is this website that can only be accessible from a special type of browser guys.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,980
If you want to know more about it, then just go search it up on Google. It literally tells you how to do it all but I definitely--

50
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,300
I like how this guy tells me how to Google things. *Laughs*

51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,340
If you guys want to know how this work, there's this website called Google and you can just look it up yourself.

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,080
So if you want to know about that, just Google it. *Laughs* WHAT!!

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,620
GUY: The dark web is not to be played around with. This is where all the negative evil s*** happens, guys. It's basically run--

54
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,420
All the negative, evil stuff is from the dark web.

55
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,380
I can't believe the dark web is coming over... ah! Look, ENERGY!

56
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,740
Did you see the chair move?!

57
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,200
GUY: --run by this evil cult, and it's where all illegal--
PEWDS: *Laughs* It's run by an evil---
GUY: --things happen.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
GUY: But on the--
PEWDS: It's where all evil things happen!

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,740
GUY: Prices range from anywhere from ten dollars to like, ten thousand dollars, guys. Three weeks ago I ordered one that was worth like a thousand dollars,

60
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,000
so I'm not gonna be able to afford to do that again for this video. I know you guys--

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,830
PEWDS: So in this video, he did the budget version of the dark web box.

62
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:22,820
I can't wait to see what's inside. What could the dark web send us. Just a bunch of cursed items.

63
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,940
It says it in the title, it's cursed!

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,520
GUY: Check it out it literally, like, &quot;DW&quot;, I don't even know--
PEWDS: Oh my God....

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,240
GUY: Ohh, you know what? That stands for the dark web.

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,380
PEWDS: This guy literally took a moving box, it's not even a shipping box, it's one of those uh... moving boxes,

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,020
and he wrote dark web on it so he could go on camera. Ooh, I think, you know what?

68
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,540
I think that means dark web.

69
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm running through this a bunch of people and we all come up with the idea that it probably stands for dark web.

70
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,620
GUY: It's so freaking crazy. Check it out, guys. Can you even, can you see anything in there? I don't think you can.

71
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,760
I am so nervous to get this open guys.

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,400
You know what happened the last time I opened one of these things, it did not end good.

73
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,180
Just before we get into actually unboxing this dark web mystery box,

74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,160
make sure you go down below and drop a like on this--

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,780
PEWDS: Of course, of course, you can't watch a video without it.

76
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,009
GUY: --and I say it every video but go down below and hit that subscribe button for--

77
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,060
PEWDS: Oh my God, okay, alright, okay. Just, open the box, please.

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,900
GUY: --you turn on the post notifications. 
PEWDS: Oh, we gotta turn on the post notifications. *Laughs*

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,020
I'm trying to skip past it and it just gets more.

80
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,520
GUY: Holy crap guys, we're gonna actually do this right now. This is pretty freaking crazy. I got my knife, ready to cut the tape open.

81
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,820
PEWDS: Wait, is that knife from the dark web?

82
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,480
GUY: There's definitely something in there, like--

83
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,640
PEWDS: I'm glad he bought a package online and it had something in it, that's always nice.

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,120
That would have been an epic troll if it was just a box.

85
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,100
GUY: Oh, my, God. Alright guys, I just managed to get the dark web box open,

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,380
and I forgot to mention in the intro that when I ordered this on the Deep Web it said something in the description about

87
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,220
it being like from Egypt, or it was like some Egyptian, ancient--

88
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,440
PEWDS: I like that he, he had to throw some extra lore in there.

89
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,540
GUY: Okay, guys, I'm just gonna have the camera set up like this while we actually unbox this video,

90
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,200
uhh, holy crap, guys. Based on the first look inside this, the stuff in here is looking like it's worth a lot of money guys, like--

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,860
PEWDS: Okay, so he's-- he's peeked in the box and he's had a quick evaluation,

92
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,880
and he's come up with the consensus that it's worth a lot of money in there.

93
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,600
Okay, I'm curious to see what he got, maybe like a bunch of gold or something.

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,520
GUY: --crap, there is a lot--
PEWDS: *Laughs*

95
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
WOW!!

96
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
That looks like it's worth a lot of money!

97
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,340
He was not kidding, huh? What have we got.

98
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,580
Damn.

99
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,860
You know what? I- I don't wanna spoil it.

100
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,980
GUY: We got a lot of stuff to go through, guys.
PEWDS: Yes, let's go through it.

101
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,180
GUY: Okay, we're just gonna jump into this guys, I'm just gonna reach my hand in there, 
PEWDS: Let's just jump into it!

102
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,960
GUY: and we're gonna grab the first thing we feel.

103
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,800
PEWDS: I like that he saw, that it was a knife in there, and then he decides, &quot;You know what? I'm not even gonna look!&quot; *Laughs*

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,840
GUY: Kay, what the hell is this, guys? Holy crap, it looks like--
PEWDS: What the frick, woah.... holy moly shmoly....

105
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,380
PEWDS: That looks like something you could just buy from CVS in the Halloween section.

106
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,840
And it's October right now. My God, the Egypts, the Ancient Egypts must have copied us. What are the odds?

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,000
GUY: --some sort of like, it looks like one of those cups like where you freaking pour--

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,760
PEWDS: It looks like one of those cups, where he... is he trolling? He has to be trolling!

109
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,020
I know he's pandering to children,

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:29,420
but the words he use are just so moronic that I can't tell if he's deliberately putting them in there, as a joke,

111
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,889
or if he just doesn't know how to ar- articulate himself.

112
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,220
GUY: --this, guys.

113
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,400
Holy crap.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,620
It looks like some sort of like,

115
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,640
it looks like one of those cups like where you freaking pour the blood in and the people like,

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:52,100
a evil cult drinks out of it guys. It's got like a creepy freaking skull face on the front. Oh my God, I wonder who has touched that.

117
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,360
PEWDS: You have.

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,580
You touched it.

119
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,440
GUY: More importantly, I wonder what it's worth. I'm trying to get my money back from buying this, guys. Ho--

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,960
PEWDS: I wonder what it's worth. Well, this is a crazy coincidence, but you can also buy them for three pounds.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,460
Guys, this is frickin crazy. They're also selling them in China, but he said they got them from Egypt. This is very scary.

122
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,840
GUY: Oh my god. I wonder who has touched that.
PEWDS: Some Chinese worker, that's who's touched it. *Laughs*

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,400
GUY: Guys, I feel like there's secretly like a freaking old rat living in this box and it's gonna like bite my finger off

124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,040
Okay. Whoa, what the hell is this?

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,040
PEWDS: It's a Gucci...cat.
GUY: Oh my God....

126
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Guys, this looks like, ohhh!

127
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,960
'Cause the, you guys, remember I was saying the box had some like sort of Egyptian thing in the description?

128
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,620
I don't know about you guys, but this looks like some sort of Egyptian thing, guys, look--

129
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,480
PEWDS: This guy, he needs to be a detective, I mean. *Laughs*

130
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,130
First of all he uncovered the secret of the text,

131
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,880
where &quot;DV&quot; stands for dark web, and then he connected that the Egypt object

132
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,140
had something to do with the fact that he ordered it from an Egyptian curse thing.

133
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,960
Oh my god if anyone's Egyptian in the comments and can tell me what this says, that would be greatly appreciated. That is freaking---

134
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,960
PEWDS: Even Stromedy himself recognize that that's beyond his level, you know.

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,620
Hey guys. If you're an Egyptian, leave a comment down below what you think these hieroglyphics mean?

136
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,820
Hey guys, if you're Swedish, just let me know what these Nordic runes means. I would greatly appreciate it.

137
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,660
As you all know ancient languages.

138
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,000
One of my favorite objects is of course the knife

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,280
that he just added in there for extra effective spookiness.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,900
I guess he looked at the box that he-- with all the stuff that he bought from a Halloween store and thought, &quot;well,

141
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:46,800
not spooky enough. We need to add a knife in there.&quot; But the best part about it is his comment about that there's a knife in there.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,960
GUY: Oh my god. There's something sharp. I think I just cut myself

143
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,240
What the hell....

144
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,440
Guys the freaking knife. Guys, I literally have a knife exactly like this. That's so weird.

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,580
PEWDS: WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!! *Laughs*

146
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,480
I like how he does this just in case some cynical ten-year-old is watching this be like,

147
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,380
&quot;Wait a minute! He has that knife, I've seen it in the background of one of his videos!&quot;

148
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,360
He can just go, &quot;whoa, it looks just like it, whoa, it looks just like the kitchen knife I have.&quot;

149
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,640
&quot;I just got THE CHILLS!!&quot;

150
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,460
This is another genius observation coming up by the way.

151
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,960
GUY: What is this...

152
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,180
PEWDS: What is this.
GUY: Oh--

153
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,420
PEWDS: Guess in the comments what he's going to guess what that is.
GUY: --my gosh, guys.

154
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,420
It looks like a freaking rope.

155
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,740
PEWDS: This guy's, this guy's the next Sherlock Holmes. It looks like a frickin rope guys.

156
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,240
GUY: Okay, I don't even want to say what I think this might have been used for guys.

157
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:52,820
But that's pretty weird a frickin rope and it's like one of those old ropes guys, like, holy crap.

158
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,180
PEWDS: Ever heard of those old ropes? *Laughs*

159
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,620
This goes on for ten more minutes?!

160
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,460
PEWDS: Whoa, is that a real skull guys?
GUY: Oh, my, God, guys. Okay, for those of you that are freaked out, this--

161
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,580
PEWDS: Oh! Okay. What is it?
GUY: --does not look like a real skull.

162
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,060
PEWDS: AH! Oh, thank God! Ah, thank God!! Oof!

163
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,260
GUY: --but I wonder what the hell this was used for guys and why it's in the box. This is pretty frickin creepy guys.

164
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,940
PEWDS: Yeah, I wonder what that was used for, but most importantly, I wonder how much it's worth.

165
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,380
I want to make sure he makes his money back on this.

166
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,820
GUY: Look at that, look at that. That is so creepy.

167
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,020
PEWDS: He's got a ball.

168
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,280
GUY: What is this?

169
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,880
GUY: We found some, like, weird looking... ball?
PEWDS: It's a ball... it's a ball... ball, you found a ball.

170
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,060
PEWDS: *Laughs*

171
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,640
This is too good, what else do we got?

172
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,100
GUY: What is this?

173
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,440
Oh my God, okay. I don't even want to touch that.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,700
I think you guys can already assume what the hell that was.

175
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,460
PEWDS: Your mom's tampon?

176
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:14,380
*WUBWUB WEEEEEEW WUWUWUB WUWUWUB*

177
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,620
GUY: What is this?

178
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,340
Oh my god it goes forever.
PEWDS: It goes forever. *Laughs*

179
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,380
GUY: Holy crap. All right, guys, we found some like weird dark chain?

180
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,710
PEWDS: Wait a minute. That's the chain from the other
GUY: --and if you guys are thinking &quot;oh

181
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,280
that's the chain from the other mystery box&quot; it's literally not, guys, like, you can go compare the colors.

182
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,700
This one is like a dark--
PEWDS: Oh, damn it. He got me. You're right. That one is darker.

183
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,620
That chain is darker from the other one. He also has some letter.
GUY: --dark web box, and the paper looks pretty new guys,

184
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,220
like it's not an old paper. It looks like it was literally just printed. Right as it was being shipped.

185
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,440
PEWDS: You mean right as you just put it in the box.

186
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,200
It also has the exact same font as he used in another stupid video.

187
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,480
I don't know why I'm even trying to prove him or whatever!

188
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,010
Okay?

189
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:10,250
I don't need to do this. But the most important part of this is: I ordered a box from the darkest web.

190
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:17,330
I paid not just a thousand. I paid ten thousand. So I hope I get my monies back. We're gonna unbox it right now.

191
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:24,030
So I got this. This is the box that I got from--

192
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:30,600
So this is the box that I got from the Deep Web guys. It arrived just this morning and it says,

193
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
...wait a minute....

194
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,870
It says...

195
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:42,780
Death Pantry. What the frick guys. What does that stand for? What does that even mean? That must mean something death, like...

196
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,510
dying? Guys, am I gonna die from opening this?

197
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,050
Okay, guys, we're gonna have to freakin unbox this right now,

198
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,680
but if I die, you have to smash like on this video right now. Whoa.

199
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,940
Holy crap, guys, it's got this...

200
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,690
Whoa. Oh, my God it goes forever. It's got this wrapping plastic in it.

201
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,620
It must be some cursed wrapping plastic, filled with demons or something, maybe there's like a ghost

202
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,200
*Pop* Whoa. Oh my gosh, guys.

203
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Oh... oh....

204
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,940
It's got a doll in it. This must be some kind of cursed frog. Oh my gosh, no way.

205
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,020
No way! A kitchen... whisker... machine... thing.

206
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,980
GUYS!

207
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,500
This is just like the one I have in my house. This must be some...

208
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,620
ancient demon trapped in a box. Oh my god guys. It's trying-- the demon is trying to kill me.

209
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,280
It's time for random shout-out time!

210
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,100
Random shout-out time! This time, it's actually not so random.

211
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,320
I found this video, thanks to Critikal, he does great videos, I really enjoy his channel.

212
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,190
He's always

213
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:57,120
finding new interesting things for me to steal from. I was also part of one of his podcasts that he does, it's really great as

214
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,900
well, so if you want to check that out, I'll leave that in the description.

215
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,400
but overall just a nice, great dude that I don't really know, I'm just assuming. *Laughs*

216
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,050
And also to...

217
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,820
Stromedy, if you're watching, I hope you enjoyed this little video. I'm sure you did. Just a fun little meme!

218
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,800
I can't wait to see what happens with the doll. So, good luck with that.

219
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
Bai!!!
