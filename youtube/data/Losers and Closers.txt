1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,939
today's vlog is going to be dedicated to

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,370
talking about an idea I hope you find

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:29,070
that interesting very cold very early

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:50,219
very dark run this morning that run this

5
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,530
morning that run in the freezing cold

6
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,260
that was at 6 o'clock this morning that

7
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,739
is 6:00 in the a.m. I was up outside

8
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,750
running in the freezing cold it is

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,810
currently 9 p.m. 9 o'clock at night

10
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,010
tomorrow morning I also have to get up

11
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,990
at 5:30 in the morning but I didn't

12
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,310
shoot a vlog today I didn't shoot a

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,229
video which is fine taking days off is

14
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,350
fine but I shot this morning which meant

15
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,470
I started something so if I didn't do a

16
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,240
vlog today it would have meant starting

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,100
something and not finishing something

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,579
and in my book that's not OK

19
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,200
someone who starts something and doesn't

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,570
finish something that is a loser someone

21
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,900
who starts something in always finishes

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,900
it that is a closer one of my favorite

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,340
movies is called Glengarry Glen Ross

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,470
here's a quick scene a B C a always be B

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,869
C closing always be closing always be

26
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,950
closing

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,079
yeah at ood that on my arm last week I

28
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,659
talked about that Voltaire quote

29
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,250
perfection is the enemy of good what

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,479
that means is you can never let your

31
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,229
desire for perfection prevent you from

32
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,000
finishing something that's good because

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,280
to finish something even imperfectly is

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,990
to learn from it and then you

35
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,810
move on and get closer to perfection

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,480
these fundamentals dovetail nicely with

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,150
my passion for YouTube prior to really

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,010
embracing YouTube I always considered

39
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,890
like my filmmaking the content I made to

40
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,500
be precious and perfection was

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,270
imperative and how that actually

42
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,100
manifested what that actually meant was

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,450
I just didn't make a lot of stuff

44
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,670
because I always had that excuse to fall

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,340
back on and embracing YouTube more

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,830
specifically giving myself this daily

47
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,710
mandate to upload a video it is forced

48
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,930
me to abandon this idea of perfection

49
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,580
this false idea of perfection and

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,290
instead forced me to focus on

51
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,410
productivity and that in aggregate over

52
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,470
time has made me a much better filmmaker

53
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,150
has made me a much better storyteller

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:27,270
creator all of that

55
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,540
give me this I need to explain something

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,890
called the Pareto principle 80% of the

57
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,570
movie that is the filming like all the

58
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,310
stuff with the camera me out running

59
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,280
around like the idea the concept all

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,070
that stuff the first 80% of the movie is

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,250
only 20% of the work and the last 20% of

62
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,950
the movie which is for me the editing

63
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,520
the last 20% of the movie is 80 percent

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,500
of the work all the things that people

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,540
typically associate with making a movie

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,180
is really only the small part of the pie

67
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,190
and the big part of the pie the pac-man

68
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,420
part this is finishing this is closing

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,459
and this rule by the way this applies to

70
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,709
everything in life this applies to

71
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,830
school whether you're a painter or a

72
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,260
musician trying to write a song trying

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,780
to start a company entrepreneurship this

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,330
applies to my business this applies to

75
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,660
when you run a marathon 26 miles the

76
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,080
first 22 is only 20% of the work it's

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,410
those last four miles that are 80% of

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,720
the work if you close or you hit the

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,560
bricks you can't push it you are hit the

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,720
bricks pal and beat it because you are

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,139
going out

82
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,710
I have to go home now because there

83
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,110
would be a terrible irony in me not

84
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,389
finishing a movie about what it means to

85
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:14,180
be a closer this is a bunch of stuff

86
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,689
people sent me for mail time that's a

87
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:36,560
light-up skateboard look it's Jessie

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,000
wait it's a little me
