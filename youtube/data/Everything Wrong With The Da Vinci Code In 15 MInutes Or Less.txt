sixty-six seconds of goddamn logos a

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,730
brisk Walker will always catch up to

00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,730
someone running for their life cliche

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,690
Fiat shot him in the head none of this

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,890
would happen the fact that the movie

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,420
thinks this many people would ever come

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,650
to a public talk titled the

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,630
interpretation of symbols professor of

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,280
religious symbology is a title that

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,900
doesn't exist at Harvard University or

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,760
anywhere else in the world symbols are a

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,860
language that can help us understand our

14
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,450
past some symbols can be written

15
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,890
together to represent words and those

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,480
collections of symbols can be combined

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,949
with other collections to form sentences

18
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,230
so in other words words or language that

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,790
can help us understand our past Robert

Langdon professor of wingding ology

professor Langdon felt the need to Ken

22
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,989
Burns this photo

23
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,399
even though zooming out doesn't reveal

24
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,780
anything that would lead these students

25
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,980
to think this was a photo of anything

26
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,320
but the KKK in English place that's

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,149
racist how in the hell did this shot of

28
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,130
Tom King Hanks in front of a giant Nazi

29
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,079

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,399
beloved American actor in front of a

31
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,200
symbol of racism and genocide Jesus I

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,309
know I wasn't put on this earth to

33
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:01,870
expose this imagery but kind of feels

34
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,250
like I was how do we write our own

35
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,560
histories personally or culturally the

36
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,790
professor doesn't realize that he is

37
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,110
auto-scrolling through the rest of his

38
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,299
presentation tonight this will be our

39
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,399
quest if you look into your chairs you

40
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,869
will each find an envelope now hiring

41
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,759
too many extras for overcrowded bar

42
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,469
scene and major motion picture this mob

43
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,609
of people is here to get the autograph

44
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,529
of a symbols professor from Harvard like

45
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:22,359
he's Tom Hanks or something considering

46
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,850
your expertise and the markings on the

47
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,380
budding clue so over here shows laying

48
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,700
in a photo of a corpse while he's in the

49
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,109
middle of a public book signing that's

50
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:30,819
not just bad police work that's rude to

51
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,020
the people who waited in line to show

52
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,789
him their pictures of corpses and waited

53
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,529
for over now he waited for over an hour

54
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,240
it was very nice of John Travolta to

55
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,560
donate his favorite hair piece to this

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,130
production

57
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,029
Morris Internet's numismatist discount

58
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,770
oh what a lovely day I have found that

59
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,569
nudity almost always enhances religious

60
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:50,630
experiences

61
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,330
ah I don't want to look at for 400 Alex

62
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,280
goddamn this movie is a Catholic 50

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,070
shades of grey me our Father we didn't

64
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,100
agree on much frankly I was surprised

65
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,020
when he contacted me that's an awfully

66
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,790
bad dub for a movie that cost 125

67
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,190
million can we take the stairs being

68
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,479
afraid of elevators when you believe in

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,950
an ancient biblical future prediction

70
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,350
code video surveillance in a museum

71
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,050
Assizes cost-prohibitive also ridiculous

72
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,510
also the Louvre has over 1,000 security

73
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,890
officers I don't teach at Harvard but I

74
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,600
do have Google how and why do they pay

75
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,190
that many officers without having money

76
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,110
for cameras just fire some dudes it's

77
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,000
not rocket science the Grand Gallery

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,250
this way you've found the body one

79
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,239
character saying what the other

80
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,500
characters in the scene already know

81
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,720
narrations distant cousin the filmmakers

82
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,310
avoid clever character deductions by

83
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,630
just simply having someone interview

84
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,760
them what would you do if you had such

85
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,800
limited time to send a message oh I

86
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,959
don't know recreate a famous Leonardo da

87
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,370
Vinci sketch with my body and leave

88
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,930
cryptic anagrams all over my place of

89
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,819
work what would you do in case you tried

90
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,769
to run we have you on a little leash

91
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,620
professor well I am moving enemy at a

92
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,900
state much also yep you are watching a

93
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,519
movie where a shady agency just bugged a

94
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,600
symbols professor in the name of

95
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,820
international security GPS tracker that

96
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,980
shows toilets quite a leap isn't it

97
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,780
Langdon sums up this entire movie

98
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,670
Jackson Young was my grandfather

99
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,700
apparently it was his dying wish that we

100
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,049
meet because the old man had his

101
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,670
fetishes just like the rest of us should

102
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,070
have walked by a subdued me instead of

103
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,570
assuming Langdon found his tracker and

104
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,950
threw it into the dump truck he assumes

105
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,209
that Langdon jumped out of the window

106
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,160
and into the dump truck I will take a

107
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,579
moment even though they are running from

108
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,140
the cops so he decides to take a moment

109
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,720
and Langdon obliges he's much older than

110
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,090
I remember here's a fun fact all people

111
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,500
are currently older than the memories

112
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,150
you have of the the sentence literally

113
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,989
applies to everyone

114
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,700
also these evil satanic Bible based

115
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,140
villains drew the star on this dude's

116
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,970
chest right-side up instead of the more

117
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,709
traditionally satanic upside down you

118
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,840
did color flashback a child runs things

119
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,100
were apparently remembered or learned

120
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,890
here from my office today several times

121
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,240
he said it wasn't my top life

122
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,130
I ignored him of course because who

123
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,540
believes that kind of worship this is

124
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,080
wrong

125
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,050
yeah see this is wrong the Fibonacci

126
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,760
numbers only makes sense when they're in

127
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,170
order what the fuck is happening right

128
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,410
now

129
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,420
nanogram I'm gonna go ahead and give ten

130
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,160
sins to cover anyone saying something

131
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,030
that the person they're talking to

132
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,470
clearly already knows when it's actually

133
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,670
just being said to explain it to the

134
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,850
viewer Co 9000 don't Frances FBI left

135
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,560
one officer at a crime scene that also

136
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,670
happens to be one of the world's most

137
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,410
famous landmarks looting this painting

138
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,180
didn't trigger an alarm did the museum

139
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,440
turn off all the alarms during this

140
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,750
investigation coz without cameras and I

141
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,400
don't see those 1,000 security guards

142
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,290
that seems like an unwise idea Madonna

143
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,910
of the rocks is not located in the same

144
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,560
room as Mona Lisa also it's more

145
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,790
commonly known as virgin of the rocks--

146
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,740
but frog kitchen Weiser doesn't make for

147
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,960
a very sexy anagram da Vinci himself

148
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,490
da Vinci only refers to where he is from

149
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,930
it would be like people referring to me

150
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,030
as of Nashville most historians call him

151
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,770
Leonardo fleur-de-lis as their crest

152
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,240
they picked one of the most common

153
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,950
symbols to signify their secret society

154
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,540
because the fleur-de-lis is also

155
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,860
associated with French Catholics in

156
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,200
general and is on coats of arms and city

157
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,120
crests and in architecture and paintings

158
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,860
and has royal associations and is on the

159
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,570
flag of Baton Rouge Louisiana and boob

160
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,400
pasties for Mardi Gras this girl driving

161
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,710
like born backwards is laughable Tom

162
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,720
Hanks is the gender swapped franka

163
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,200
potente

164
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,440
aka borns girlfriend your luck combined

165
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,670
with a screenwriter who likes you I

166
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,080
think this flashback is literally

167
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,670
footage from taking julian assange

of the night yeah you should be fine

181

191
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,460
place to think

192
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,870
you paid off a druggie and bought all

193
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,100
his belongings just so you could use

194
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,420
this picnic table as a place to think

195
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,220
the fuck's wrong with the officer at the

196
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,680
car or a hotel bar or motherfucking

197
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,990
bathroom stall any all these options are

198
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,590
better than

199
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,750
50 euros on a needle a candle some drugs

200
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,430

201
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,660
puzzles codes a treasure hunt yep this

202
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,250
is the religious non fun national

203
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,870
treasure you were all clamoring for nice

204
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,270
going America the Templars were all but

205
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,980
exterminated what's not have been very

206
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,810
good Knights to begin with if 99% of

207
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,280
them can be all bitch killed in the same

208
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,460
night right the date was October 13th

209
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,540
1307 of Friday Friday the 13th also haha

210
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,430
also fear of Friday the 13th didn't

211
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,110
really begin until the early 20th

212
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,550
century even though some of the actual

213
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,170
Knights of Templar were arrested on this

214
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,670
day mainstream historians don't

215
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,960
associate it with right at the 13th

216
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,970
superstition nun bashing this prayer

217
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,320
over a dead woman is intended to show

218
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,420
that this guy is even if misguided still

219
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,070
devout whatever I'm not gonna forget

220
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,450
that he straight-up murder this not so

221
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,600
your character development is in vain

222
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,950
1976 76 a year of Independence 1976 was

223
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,540
a year of Independence for Portugal this

224
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,190
movie I like it's characters sees what

225
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,440
it wants to see lot is being spared that

226
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,180
yeah but you're spilling it also that's

227
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,860
why you're spilling I know you Catholics

228
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,550
have trouble telling the difference

229
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,830
sometimes a single wrong entry disables

230
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,420
the system because rich people don't

231
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,900
make mistakes honey I don't even like

232
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,730
history this is the historical biblical

233
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,350
treasure hunting movie equivalent of I'm

234

his suspicious that's a good cop but

241
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,220
then he's immediately dissuaded because

242
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,840
that driver tries to sell him the launch

243
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,610
for a cheap price on the spot so he lets

244
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,100

there used to keep secrets well there

252
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
used to decipher codes that's not as

253
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,710
romantic a way of putting it is what you

254
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,880
just said but it's still way more

255
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,320
accurate you make it sound like a

256
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,670
Pensieve and Harry Potter when it's

257
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,780

258
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,530

261
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,940
seeing it

262
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,870

who knew that much about a creek yes

264
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,740
that's because they don't exist not

265
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,660
looking at the road while driving also

266
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,310
being a truck driver and not Hawking at

267
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,449
the person coming straight toward you

268
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,430
this weird face massage goes on for some

269
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,110
time instead of killing them and sparing

270
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,580

278
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,659
though more hilarious when it was Sandra

279
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,800
Bullock doing this bit and demolition

280
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,720
man but still you rural screenwriter

281
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,460
language barriers are hysterical

282
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,760
was a lifelong pagan who was baptized on

283
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,650
his deathbed I'm just gonna toss about

284
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,990
12 more sins on this movie for all the

285
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,190
liberties it takes with church history

286
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,380
one for each of the twelve disciples but

287
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,810
a growing religious turmoil was a

288
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,270
gripping Rome three centuries earlier a

289
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,980
young Jew named Jesus come along oh

290
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,290
you're saying disah's divinity came from

291
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,029
a vote how else did you think the Bible

292
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,500
was put together lady all the humans

293
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,209
watch while it put itself together it's

294
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,220
not semantics Yuri you're interpreting

295
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,020
facts to support your own conclusions

296
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,370
Tom Hanks Ian McKellen and Audrey

297
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,350
tatooine message board the movie SATs

298
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,450
for many Christians putting the literal

299
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,709
chessboard between them during this

300
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,330
argument is a bit on the nose mr. Howard

301
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,490
considering both the Bible and standard

302
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,680
Grail legend celebrate this moment as

303
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,510
the definitive arrival of the holy

304
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,550
prayer the Bible contains no mention of

305
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,050
the Holy Grail I'm starting to severely

306
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,459
doubt this man's credentials as a Grail

307
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,830
historian you're saying the Holy Grail

308
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,650
is a person a woman just go with it

309
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,029
ma'am or we'll be here for three hours

310
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,820
oh wait oh hey Scott dome on the mind

311
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,070
sees what it chooses to see scotoma

312
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,779
refers to partial loss of vision he

313
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,339
might mean pareidolia which refers to

314
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,900
seeing patterns that aren't there which

315
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,580
is what he seems to be guilty of besides

316
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,810
not knowing anything about what he's

317
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,070
been researching his whole life and

318
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,520
these two figures changed position I'm

319
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,500
smelling some serious both right here we

320
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,970
could change all of their positions to

321
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,230
make the last supper look like the last

322
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,880
orgy but we don't because that would be

323
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,440
looking stupid but I bet some of your

324
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,820
gonna do it anyway and I can't wait to

325
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,830
see it listen to this it's from the

326
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,810
Gospel according to Philip alternative

327
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,040
sunday-school the movie the witches

328
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,019
it's instructed the clergy on how to

329
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,600
locate torture and kill this movie's

330
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,580
original title was literally three hours

331
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,040
of exposition inside the Keystone no

332
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,709
beer map I'm at lead us to the hologram

333
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm sorry didn't you just spend like the

334
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,100
last 20 minutes explaining the girl was

335
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,200
a person a blood descendent of Christ so

336
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,940
how can a map in a Keystone from

337
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,680
centuries ago actually lead anyone to a

338
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,240
living breathing human being with the

339
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,470
free will to go wherever he or she

340
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,839
chooses

341
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,370
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba apparently the riddle

342
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,779
song is the theme for Harry Potter I

343
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,980
realize you're trying to evade the cops

344
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,329
but there's an argument to be made that

345
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,910
using paved roads even well possibly

346
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,649
expected by the cops is still a faster

347
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,000
getaway option than these roller coaster

348
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,529
woods you've chosen we are in the middle

349
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,480
of a wall on one that has been going on

350
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,140
forever

351
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,880
actually 2000 years give or take a

352
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,079
couple hundred what if the world

353
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,700
discovers of the greatest story ever

354
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,519
told is actually alive then the world

355
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,140
will probably continue just as it is

356
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,329
because what was it the mind sees what

357
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:16,089
it chooses to see oh oh that's right

358
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,620
modern scholars agree Jesus was likely

359
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,360
on the cross for about six hours twice

360
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,829
the length of this movie and without

361
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,540
ever having been crucified I can tell

362
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,070
you without question this movie is much

363
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,690
more excruciating even at half the time

364
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,660
yeah doesn't forgive matters actually he

365
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,500
does sorry

366
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,380
once the sarcophagus is destroyed DNA

367
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,020
testing will be impossible there is no

368
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,700
way to prove a living bloodline there's

369
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,110
also no way to prove whatever body in

370
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,370
the sarcophagus is actually Mary

371
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,860
Magdalene a guardian of the Holy Grail

372
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,589
it sounds so stupid so P would be

373
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:46,660
excellent at cinemasins I means my

374
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,540
innate Robert like a girl again just

375
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,760
with no gift at the end it's obvious

376
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,170
Sophia is the descendant of Jesus this

377
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,760
movie is searching for I'm not sure why

378
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,020
the movie tries to act like it could be

379
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,000
anyone else but for three hours it sure

380
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,450
does

381
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,550
I'm sorry shit bout to know cuz day wait

382
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,529
he's still wearing the Opus Dei pin why

383
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,430
does he think this is some sort of

384
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,020
secret movie acts like they just pulled

385
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,579
off some Ocean's eleven move when they

386
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:08,079
just got out of the complain before the

387
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,850
cops showed up my what a lovely fake ass

388
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,770
palace you have when he was a boy young

389
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,990
Robert having to a well just like Bruce

390
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,240
Wayne and baby Jessica also Robert has

391
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
the same weaknesses as the aliens from

392
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,070
science it's 1185 modern London just

393
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,380
sprang up right around it does everyone

394
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,699
have to explain everything all the time

395
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:25,839
it's like being followed by a

396
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,850
personified Wikipedia in that some

397
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,350
information might be true but there's no

398
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,600
way to know for sure those

399
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,850
nights with their legs crossed means

400
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,069
they've been to the Holy Land oh I

401
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,329
thought it meant they had to go to the

402
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,449
bathroom you don't have a close shot yes

403
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,550
I do dunk dunk dong I'm totally

404
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,290
surprised by that non surprise Ron

405
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,880
Howard has been hinting at every time

406
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,529
this Remy dude has been on screen since

407
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,630
the movie began shocked I tell you Wow

408
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,699
you got me movie punching old people

409
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:54,139
sorry

410
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,819
deus ex machina like maybe for real this

411
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,209
time

412
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,040
dear God make me a bird so I can fly far

413
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,170
far far away from here the nuns don't

414
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,649
scatter

415
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,060
I love how Paul Bettany albino assassin

416
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,860
just casually wears a friars robe

417
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,240
everywhere he goes like that won't

418
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,130
arouse any weird looks or suspicion this

419
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,959
movie has about 14 surprise reveals too

420
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,380
many hey Pope his first initial how did

421
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,660
I miss that because the words a pope

422
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,190
make absolute and perfect sense on their

423
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,690
own without deeper meaning or further

424
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,269
interpretation these attacks movie about

425
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,709
ciphers and riddles gets overshadowed

426
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,690
near the end by a scooby-doo esque Hey

427
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,930
look footprints moment you sir have been

428
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,750
a ghost allmovie.com be exposed

429
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,509
mankind can finally set free there are

430
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:34,949
over 1 billion Catholics in the world

431
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,959
which means about 6 billion people in

432
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,819
the world aren't Catholic in fact about

433
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,920
2/3 of mankind isn't even Christian so

434
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,130
calm down Appl a that spells asshole

435
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,439
also in what movie an apple is not a

436
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,509
goddamn or an apple is a fruit and even

437
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,829
if you were to describe its shape you

438
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,630
would not use the word or you use the

439
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,250
words vaguely roundish with both the top

440
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,660
and bottom Buttle we're in the bottom

441
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,310
but hole is often surrounded by foreign

442
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,079
knuckle peaks and the top butt hole

443
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,670
almost universally has a stem growing

444
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,050
out of it not a king orbit thank you

445
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,420
oh really obvious here of Christ really

446
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,889
if this whole thing collapses in a

447
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,120
flying saucer takes off from underneath

448
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,130
I swear to god I'm gonna lose my son

449
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,720

450
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,569
secret of the Holy Grail Sofie you are

451
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,819

452

453
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,720
welcome home child we don't believe your

454
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,430
ancestor Jesus was divine but we do

455
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,689
believe in treating you like you were

456
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,819
divine for some reason maybe that junkie

457
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,199
in the park will never touch a drug

458
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,000
again

459
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,660
also ending and that's beneath the room

460
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,550

461
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,269

462

god why oh my lord auric the rock I got

464
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,730
a big old life blown away in the blink

465
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,769
of an eye

466
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,300
nothing left but all the time in the

467
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,750
world to think about it who's in the box

468
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,029
oh what's in the box

469

470
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,050
in danger I said grave danger if you

471
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,399
want to get a woman to fall in love with

472
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,850

474
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,030
killing is that

475
