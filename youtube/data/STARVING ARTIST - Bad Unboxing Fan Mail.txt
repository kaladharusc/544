1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,000
hey I'm really bored and I decided to

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,830
switch things up a little bit instead of

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,250
normal bad unboxing I wanted to paint a

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,769

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,809

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,240

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,050

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,609
blue and titanium white you know the

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,920
good thing about painting and I'm sure

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,080
Bob Ron said this at some point is there

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,850
any rules you know there's no rulebook

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,130
well there is a rulebook that's a lie

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,230
there's a rulebook I'm sure an art

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,300
person would you know crucify you if you

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,920
broke one of those rules in the rule

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,809
book the only thing that rules in

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,140
painting is you before we keep going

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,850

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,059
the UPS box is now closed unfortunately

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,530
there's just way too many packages to

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,660
keep up with I will get through all the

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,670
ones that have been sent up to this date

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,390
but I can't accept any more past this

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,129
because I just wouldn't be able to keep

26
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,589
up first package is dressed to idubbbz

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,049
your fucking alcoholic cohorts still

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,540
applying how convenient

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,380
a wine glass whoa

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,320
Diddy Kong amiibo looks like it might be

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,299
artwork if you're worried about me doing

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,130
this to your fan art don't worry I'm

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,200
only gonna do this to like you know very

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,830
obviously just low effort bullshit if it

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,360
looks like it might be special to

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,829
someone I'm not gonna do it but this is

37
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,979
clearly that classic big buff black I

38
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,509
mean we've seen all over the internet a

39
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,310
thousand times before I feel like I'm

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,930
gonna go the obvious route and basically

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,900
just turn him into the end of the spider

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,400
not too bad

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,170
smashing the patriarchy is my cardio the

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,329
teaching of Buddha all right we're going

45
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,369
to the defilement section all right

46
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:54,899
we're working on the web maybe like a

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,420
funnel like a funnel web a lot of people

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,490
say that art should make you feel

49
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,409
something I don't feel like that's true

50
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,049
I feel like art she just kind of looked

51
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,350
cool the bleach joke it's just never

52
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,929
gonna get old it's always gonna be a

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,599

in a little bit more high-class one

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
thing remember is this series progresses

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,379
the threats remain real people can still

58
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,510
send me shit that's smells really bad

59
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,890

67
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,720
point in time where mousetraps were a

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,370
little bit more um scary of a

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,500
proposition to put your finger on but

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,319

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,160
are they on my neck that's cool I'm just

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,380
not realizing I can apply less pressure

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,990
that's probably since retarded I'm just

116
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,400
now figuring out you're gonna apply less

117
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,560
pressure to the brush if you have darks

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,270
it'll be lighter it certainly doesn't

119

124
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,830

132
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,260
classic bikini top here you know

133
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,450
perfecting your craft is important you

134
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,410
don't want to go into anything

135
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,650
half-assed package number tres I just

136
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,440
lost my blow job babe and I got it right

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,890

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,919
has sort of a cool illustration there

140
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,110
and right there a lot of these curves

141
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,220
are kind of confusing because you got

142
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,500
this one here which has a I guess a

143
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,210
normal back or what I would consider a

144
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,500
normal back because I don't know what

145
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
fake Pokemon cards would look like and

146
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,919
then you have just an all like shiny

147
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,960
front now we're done with the packages

148

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,919
touches as things all right where we

150
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,710
gonna add this actually now that I got

151
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,600

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,970
bit of this over here think about that

153
