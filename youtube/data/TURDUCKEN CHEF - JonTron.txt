candy corn down into a liquid viscous

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,960
gold so I decided to come up with my own

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,149

19

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,000
inside of a duck inside of a turkey

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
[Music]

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,580
it's the Frankenstein of foods really

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,370
borderline unethical okay by the way you

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,750
might be thinking John how'd you devise

28
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,440
that well I didn't that one comes out

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,480
Paula Dean go right on Food Network

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,030
Paula's just smile it away but I tell

31
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,250
you what the turkey chicken and duck

32
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,170
probably aren't true story this is a

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,740
dish so vile that PETA video condemning

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,950
it yet hello the Internet today we're

35
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,720
going to make a vegan version of a

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,750
turducken or as it's also known a tofu

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,990
in a turducken is a chicken stuffed

38
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,150
inside a duck stuffed inside a turkey

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,490
which is probably the grossest I've ever

40
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,460
heard of usually eaten by simple eggs

41
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,040
that's one bad recipe if you got grandma

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,190
cursing up a storm over it so now I with

43
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,070
literally zero training I'm about to try

44
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,960
to cook this thing as you can see the

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,340
level is advanced baby I burn eggs prep

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,830
time 30 minutes total 13 hours all right

47
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,460
here we go

48
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:13,950
step one the chicken free bird all right

49
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,190
let's I have no idea what I'm doing

50
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,140
oh she's beautiful I know people are

51
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,250
gonna make fun of me cuz they're like

52
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,080
what you've never debone a chicken

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,910
before is that part of the procedures as

54
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,290
a maxi pad she was on the rag before she

55
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,720
hit the slaughterhouse this just shows

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,360
how either incompetent my generation or

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,670
me is so the trick the trick to

58
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,160
turducken is you have to get you have to

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,310
debone this basically so we have to make

60
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,239
an incision here yeah who needs these

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,180
yeah there goes that was I supposed to

62
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,209
get rid of the wing well I have well I

63
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,489
have okay not so bad not so bad I'm

64
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,470
supposed to get that thing right that

65
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,830
whole middle out but keep the rest

66
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,859
intact now I know this is true but you

67
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:11,200
see the method of doing so is the

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,879
is the part that I don't understand

69
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,860
something about there's a bone here a

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,220
joint and I'm not a doctor but I think

71
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,879
that's what I'm dealing with

72
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,129
okay I was I was more scared than the

73
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,060
chicken I'm dealing with

74
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,709
oh I've sliced myself can you get

75
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,040
salmonella in the bloodstream I think

76
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,690
I've got the hang of this now there it

77
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,519
goes there it goes oh I actually got

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,430
this anyways there's that she's gone

79
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,560
it's gone that is gone whatever is I

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,989
don't care there we go

81
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,349
boneless chicken fillet hey if the Sun

82
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,690
don't rise in the east then that ain't a

83
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,819
beautiful fillet if the Sun does rise

84
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,250
nice then I don't know kind of metaphor

85
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,630
him go for him trying to say is that's a

86
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,000
beautiful bird you know even in my

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,069
wildest dreams I thought this couldn't

88
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,489

92
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,540
in New York City and I said you got duck

93
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,310

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,050
Chinatown cuz I took the subway I took

101

119
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,969
thing

120
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,469

124
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,809

00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:10,319
going anywhere

136
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,159
