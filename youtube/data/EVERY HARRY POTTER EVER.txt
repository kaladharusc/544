1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,320
-*gasp*

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,200
Harry!  A snake!

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,120
Talk to it.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,800
-Umm... Snakes are really boring.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,260
-Please?

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,560
It must be so cool to talk in parseltounge!

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,600
-Ugh. fine.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,600
-Sssay, Sss-whats up?

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,100
-Ssssup, Do you know where I could find any miccce?

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,880
-No!

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,780
*Snake attack*

12
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,100
*Bad English Shreiking*

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,780
-How Cool!

14
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,960
*More Bad English Sheiking*

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,620
-Every Harry

16
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,120
-POTTA (Potter)

17
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,060
-ever

18
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,140
*Theme music play*

19
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,220
-Now, Ms. J.K. Rowling, you've said before

20
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,460
that Dumbledore is gay,

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,700
is that something you decided on the spot, or has that always been your intention?

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,660
-Oh, I just decided.

23
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,300
Also, Nagini used to be human,

24
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,120
Hagrid's a hoarder,

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
and Snape sells weed.

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,760
-Ooh, well, hold on, that changes the entire context of the story.

27
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,460
-I'm ruining Harry Potter because it isn't for you, it's for me.

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,080
-Well-

29
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
-Ron wets the bed.

30
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
-Okay...

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,620
-And Neville's a furry.

32
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,840
-EXPECTO PATRONUM

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,740
-So, you want to teach defense against the dark arts.

34
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,100
-Yessir.

35
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,180
-Well, then I just have two questions;

36
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,280
-Do you hate kids, and do you have any secret connection with Voldemort?

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,800
-Yes..

38
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,080
and yes!

39
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,260
-Hmm!

40
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,900
-Well, obviously in that case,

41
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,860
you're hired!

42
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,360
-Great!

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,180
And my first order of business is to isolate Harry Potter in a locked room as soon as possible.

44
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,020
-And I'd be happy to help with that.

45
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,040
-let's do it, home skillet.

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,540
-alright!

47
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,180
-bump

48
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,460
-My wands is actually a stylus.

49
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,360
-'arry, yah luk tired-duh.
[Harry, you look tired.]

50
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,900
-Are you doing that mind connection thing with Voldermort again?

51
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,740
-Maybe.

52
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,480
-Well don't you see that that puts us in danger?

53
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,100
-Yeah?

54
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,940
-Wehl can't yah stohp?
[Well can't you stop?]

55
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,120
*mocking Ron* -I dunt wunt tah stohp-puh.
[I don't want to stop.]

56
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,280
*high pitched scar induced noise*
-(grunts)

57
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,640
It's Voldemort!

58
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,520
He can see us!

59
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
And he's coming to kill us right now!

60
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
--Ah, seriously Harry...
[Ah, seriously Harry...]

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,920
-Why must you make continuously poor decisions that your friends and family have to pay for?!

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,780
-*scoffs*

63
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,380
You guys have to be nice to me!

64
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,200
*Sad music*
My parwents [parents] are dead!

65
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,160
*sad English whimper*

66
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,340
-Mister Potter, our newest celebrity.

67
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,520
-Miss McGonagall?

68
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,700
Would you be willing to sign my permission slip to visit Hogsmeade?

69
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,060
-I'm sorry Mr. Potter,

70
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,960
but only parent or Guardian can give you permission.

71
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,380
-So let me get this staight...

72
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,240
I need parental permission in order to go on a field trip to the local village to eat sweets.

73
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
BUT...

74
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560
I don't need any sort of parental permission in order to get

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,220
several concussions playing quidditch,

76
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,640
LITERALLY fight a dragon during the triwizard tournament,

77
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,200
AND

78
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,680
as part of a lesson, be attacked by a creature who LITTERALLY takes the shape of your deepest darkest fears!

79
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,540
-That is correct, Mister Potter.

80
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,120
-Oi, I'm Hagrid.

81
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,080
-I need someone else's wand

82
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,440
to kill Harry Potter.

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,520
*deep breath*

84
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,860
Lucius...

85
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,480
It wa--

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,120
Wait...

87
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
What are you doing?!

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Why do you have that sandwich in your hand?!

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,180
-Oh!

90
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,100
Are these... not... snacks for the meeting?

91
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,020
-Noooo!

92
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,120
That's a horcrux!

93
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,800
-You put a piece of your soul into a sandwich?!

94
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,720
-Well!...

95
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,020
...I guess I didn't really think that one through...

96
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,220
-Uh uh.  I was gonna sa- *shoves horacrux sandwich in mouth*

97
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,080
-*angry noises*

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,260
Hey!  Come on, man!

99
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,260
-I'm so sorry, Dark Lord!  I'm just--

100
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,940
I'm a sucker for avacado!

101
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,220
-*Dark Lord sigh*

102
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,020
-Am I the only one here that thinks Voldemort got a nose job?

103
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,840
*TV
-oh, no... dementors...*

104
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
-Yoooo!

105
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,660
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is on!

106
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,800
-I hate this movie.

107
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,540
No, but I thought you loved Harry Potter.

108
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,340
Yeah, the books, but the movie ruined the story.

109
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,060
-...Well, this seems pretty much the same to me.

110
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,560
-Okay.

111
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
*exasperated sigh.*

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,440
In the book, Dumbledore CALMLY asks Harry if he put his name in the goblet

113
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,940
BUT in the movie,

114
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,400
he YELLS it.

115
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,980
-So the entire story is ruined because of the delivery of one line.

116
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,540
Even though the line itself is EXACTLY the same.

117
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,320
-YES!!!

118
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,260
Finally!  Someone who gets it!

119
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,520
-Is that Moaning Murtle?

120
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,180
-No, that's Jake.  He had Taco Bell.

121
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,300
-Oh...

122
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,960
-Luk owt, Harree!  A dahmentoorrrr...
[Look out, Harry.  A demntor.]

123
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,180
-Expelliarmus!

124
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,860
-What?  No, Harree. [Harry]  
They don't have wannnnds. [wands]

125
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,520
Ya gotta summon a patronus or 
somethinggg. [something]

126
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,160
-Expelliarmus!!

127
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,140
-Oh come on, Harreee!  [Harry]

128
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,920
-Okay!...

129
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,620
Don't be angry with me but, that MIGHT be the only spell that I know.

130
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,820
-Rellay Harree?
[Really Harry?]

131
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,060
-You have to be nice to me, Ron!

132
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,360
*sad music*
My parents are dead!

133
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,180
-*under breath*
Always the parents!

134
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,860
-Hey, Ron.

135
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,320
-Wuhat, Harree...
[What, Harry...]

136
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,100
-Can I date your sister?

137
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,500
-No, Harreee!  [Harry]

138
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,700
-I'll give you chocolate?

139
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,360
-Okay, Harree.  [Harry]

140
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
-Woah!  Run, Ron!

141
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
-Every Harry

142
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,600
POTTA [Potter]

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840

*beep beep*

145
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,600
-Now, Ms. Dumbledore you said before that--

146
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,100
Sorry...

147
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,640
-*Laughter*

148
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,520
-No, no.

149
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,020
*beep beep*

150
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,960
-Let's go make a baby.

151
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,340
-Yes.

152
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,480
*baby making foot steps.*

153
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,980
*beep beep*

154
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,940
Yo! Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is on!

155
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,500
-*Ridiculous voice*
Uh, I hate--*laughs*
Sorry...

156
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,080

Uh, I hate this.

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,260
