1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,800
Comcast this already annoying logo which

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,030
I'm going to go ahead and give five

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,400
since four introduces the first fart

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,809
joke in under a minute of the movie's

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,020
runtime the rule book states that if a

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,369
joke of this nature occurs in under a

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,869
minute then the movie shall be levy to

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,850
fart tax of ten more since what it all

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,220
came to an end in season three so did

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,170
Balthazar go into puberty just now on

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,820
the show and they continue filling

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,360
leading us all to wonder where is he now

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,559
this leads me to wonder who's watching

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,510
this hardcopy show why is this the

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,829
format they used for Balthazar's

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,270
backstory if we're just gonna cut to the

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,100
present day version playing a villain on

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,160
TV was fun but being one in real life is

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,379
even better Trey Parker voices a

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,000
character in a despicable Me movie and I

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,079
couldn't be more shocked if they

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,239
announced the bass ketball - also boasts

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,489
position or is it boats position I mean

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,469
I guess it's boats position also also

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,329
introducing Balthazar breath a character

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,829
that seems entirely inspired by Peter

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,390
Dinklage's character and pixels which

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,040
was based on Billy Mitchell from the

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,810
king of Kong but mostly the pixels thing

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,250
because it sucks

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,280
[Music]

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,420
Balthazar made a mixtape that has love

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,159
songs on one side and heist music on

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,020
another I know this is a cartoon but who

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,880
does that also when Clive flips over the

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,100
tape he flips it at 180 degrees right to

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,570
left making this cassette player nah

38
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,680
impossible

39
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,780
[Music]

40
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,070
this is a terrible movie but it's even

41
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,060
worse when you realize that a

42
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,350
significant portion of the budget was

43
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,060
used to get the rights to a Michael

44
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,680
Jackson song even if Balthazar is the

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,940
sneakiest character in the world his

46
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,380
speedboat should have already announced

47
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,120
his presence to these two ships even if

48
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,140
the lookout is only concerned with

49
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,100
looking in one direction

50
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,990
nice try at pettiness illumination but

51
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,550
you can really only start throwing shade

52
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,780
after you've made something as good as

53
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,710
Finding Nemo any explanation given for

54
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,540
how the convenient weaponized bubblegum

55
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
works no god this movie already and it

56
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,080
hasn't even been five minutes

57
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,790
Silas sounded the alarm about the heist

58
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,830
after it was ongoing and Balthazar just

59
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,660
got the diamond so how'd it grew and

60
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,710
Lucie get here so fast

61
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,060
were they just out riding around in

62
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,100
their torpedoes for fun in the exact

63
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,480
location as the ship with the time and

64
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,370
she's getting away what do you think

65
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,840
this is really the faster form of

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,100
transportation why didn't they ride

67
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,240
these fuckers the entire time so cute

68
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,860
this girl who thinks the minions are

69
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,300
cute must have missed out on all the

70
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,560
assholes in the world using these

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,150
fuckers as teeth grinding memes for the

72
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,740
last seven years you'd think after just

73
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,180
one time having a weapon knocked out of

74
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,770
these guys hands they'd stop standing so

75
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,390
close to each other but that would ruin

76
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,300
whatever gag this is supposed to be

77
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,709
cruditÃ© Jesus Christ in the first seven

78
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,180
minutes alone they've packed in at least

79
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,680
seven thousand five hundred and thirty

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,450
four 80s references can't wait til they

81
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:40,650
get to the slap bracelets in act 2 funny

82
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:40,980
bit

83
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,540
but if bruised this close to the window

84
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,800
that means this building is currently

85
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,660
being destroyed by the floating ship so

86
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,220
are these beach babes actually gonna

87
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,290
these minions I mean I'm not judging I

88
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,459
just want to know how that's supposed to

89
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,750
work and if they have the proper

90
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,610
protection against mini eights no one on

91
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,350
this beach either noticed or cared that

92
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,730
a giant freighter floating above their

93
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,290
heads is being boarded by heavily armed

94
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,850
government agents there must be some

95
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,590
awesome moly available at the speech I

96
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,120
even bother with the subterfuge of

97
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,200
disguising the entrance to the

98
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,850
headquarters if the transport occurs out

99
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,739
in the wide open as everyone in this

100
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,450
universe and capable of looking up what

101
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,060
tried a few losers as agent Groh valery

102
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,130
enacted her hostile takeover of the AVL

103
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,720
and was promoted from the head office

104
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,310
but she doesn't know who congruous

105
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,140
either from his villain or hero days oh

106
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,140
the girls who apparently don't aged over

107
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,700
the course of seven years of movies how

108
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,480
could you let Balthasar brat the AVL's

109
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,000
most-wanted villain

110
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,950
just get away wait Balthazar is the

111
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,260
AVL's most wanted villain so why didn't

112
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,270
you send I mean I want every agent in

113
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,960
the area Silas told everyone in the area

114
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,940
to go there but how is that only GRU and

115
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,330
Lucy are they based in Miami this highly

116
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,070
secretive agency feels the best way to

117
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,540
fire their agents is to throw them out

118
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,270
in the clear view of the public today

119
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,150
Lucy and I were invited do not work

120
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,810
anymore what's the problem though sure

121
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,520
the agency's probably provided some good

122
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,959
benefits but GRU was independently

123
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,580
wealthy even after he stopped being a

124
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:12,020
villain in the last movie does let's not

125
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,780
go over to Kade this house and crew

126
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,549
still has minions and a ton of weaponry

127
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,350
but bands the kids from being exposed to

128
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,530
the real evil like pokerstars.com

129
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,820
also you knew this highlight reel of

130
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,680
good GRU and evil GRU couldn't go

131
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
without at least two jokes

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,020
leisa me labo Pomodoro Tom quit over two

133
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,480
movies GRU hasn't said in minionese but

134
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,280
all of a sudden he breaks that out here

135
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,340
on the surface of an unfunny joke Mel's

136
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,350
trying to Norma Rae the minions here but

137
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,000
if they're so fixated on villainy why

138
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,470
didn't they strike during the last movie

139
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,400
when they had the exact same

140
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
reservations in case you confused it

141
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,300
with Paris Sierra Leone that Chief of

142
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,910
Police sent me he was concerned that

143
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,740
during the recent highest attempt the

144
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,760
Dumont diamond was replaced with a phony

145
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,080
we find out later this is Balthazar in

146
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,150
disguise but seriously wouldn't a museum

147
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,530
have already conducted this test and

148
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,790
then wonder why the police chief is

149
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,470
telling a gem expert to go to the museum

150
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,970
unannounced I guess a villain needs to

151
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,620
make a dramatic escape in most instances

152
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,510
but can he just walk out the front door

153
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,460
he's sleep darted the entire museum

154
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,020
staff I was considering groot just

155
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,580
committed an extremely casual homicide

156
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,200
he may as well go back into full

157
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,750
villainy after you and your father were

158
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,540
born your father and I divorced and

159
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,370
someone was there to document the exact

160
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,140
moment you guys fell outta love decided

161
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,669
to divorce and separate the kids with a

162
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,680
short burst of Polaroids we each took

163
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,249
one son two ways on our own

164
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,739
and promised never to see each other

165
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,659
again and this agreement was totally

166
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,949
fine with him whatever laws were in

167
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,929
place at the time also why did drew wait

168
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,729
so long to contact group just because

169
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,139
their parents divorced it doesn't mean

170
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,729
he wasn't allowed to find him all this

171
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,279
time this is the family business the

172
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,769
largest peak farm in the whole of

173
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,839
Freedonia hard to believe the pig farms

174
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,339
still in business considering they just

175
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,629
leave these assholes anywhere on the

176
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,819
property including the runway no that's

177
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,779
my private part holy Sh like I decide so

178
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,049
hard I crack a rib it's almost like they

179
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:12,610
told Steve Carrel try and do something

180
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,169
more annoying than minions and this is

181
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,239
what happened after take 1 million 57 I

182
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,159
was my brother finding the wife like you

183
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:26,079
when he is so bald that's boldest screw

184
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,879
was super goddamn excited about meeting

185
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,499
his twin who's been nothing but nice to

186
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,179
his family but one crack about him being

187
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:32,679
bald immediately softened his brother

188
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,309
boner now you can be how the hell was

189
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,989
this show a hit even if brats considered

190
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,459
cool in the eighties he does a bunch of

191
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,109
evil right we're kids ready for the

192
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,089
antihero concept back then oh it's too

193
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,219
bad gruel won't be around to try and

194
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:45,849
stop me

195
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,529
how does brat know that GRU was fired

196
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,419
does he have an unexplained mole deep in

197
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,969
the AVL's HR department the pig farm was

198
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,919
just a cover for the real family

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,459
business

200
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,739
damn drew wasted no time in telling guru

201
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,479
about his sinister family background how

202
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,769
did he know grooms not still working for

203
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:08,619
the AVL GRU work for the AVL where

204
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,029
surely someone would have made mention

205
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,529
that his dad was a villain unless the

206
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,329
AVL simply erases all evidence of all

207
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,860
the villains they'd ever gone after even

208
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,909
though the front of the car is pointing

209
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,499
down during the fall this grappling-hook

210
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,179
shoots at the top of the cliff because

211
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,099
this franchise has a big meaty middle

212
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,629
finger for those of you who believe in

213
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:23,439
physics

214
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,629
go take a bite of his cheese young lady

215
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,219
just do it what's the worst that could

216
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:27,789
happen

217
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,469
Lucy encourages Margot to not only

218
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,239
approach strange foreign men but also to

219
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,599
eat whatever they have in their hands

220
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,129
when I bartender temporarily forgets

221
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,869
which eye he's lost I don't try and tell

222
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:39,159
me this is a subtle clue that he's

223
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,569
faking the one eye thing because this

224
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,590
movie is anything but subtle

225
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,260
steal candy yes please village cops

226
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,280
mobilize fast

227
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,510
were they staking that candy truck out

228
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,520
also if King candy truck isn't open

229
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,810
during the middle of the day what about

230
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,250
the festival that's happening nearby are

231
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,870
we saying these pigs can catch up to the

232
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,400
souped-up hotrod earlier I thought it

233
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,630
was amusing that evil brat was

234
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,800
outrunning the cops in his big wheel

235
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,450
because that's something an 80s kid show

236
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,370
might do but now I'm thinking this movie

237
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,320
believes non engine vehicles can compete

238
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,750
with cars but they just went through the

239
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,520
wall in the town right those cops were

240
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,410
relentless during this chase but just

241
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,700
gave up when they encountered a hole in

242
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,110
the ground sure everyone in the

243
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,790
supposedly realistic Southern California

244
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,470
city just ignore the army of cirrhosis

245
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,780
pills walking down the sidewalk man this

246
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,950
pizza delivery guide is never-ending

247
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,510
stack of pizzas that go past that

248
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,830
letterboxing you're telling me the

249
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,030
restaurant allows him to deliver pizzas

250
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,860
in a way that will cause lost inventory

251
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,450
and 75% of their profits

252
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,760
car required asshole so wait this poster

253
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,740
is advertising a show called sing but

254
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,120
it's not the movie that came out six

255
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,680
months before this one it's just another

256
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,120
thing called sing exclamation point

257
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,310
originality watch movie also if they are

258
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,840
related I want to see a universe where

259
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,340
Seth MacFarlane and Trey Parker have to

260
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,630
do a scene together especially after

261
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,130
that whole cartoon Wars thing a few

262
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,660
years ago the minions were able to walk

263
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,950
through the backstage production and

264
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,240
onto the stage of a currently filming

265
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,860
singing competition because we've

266
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,330
literally run out of situations to put

267
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,430
these little quads into also characters

268
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,750
running through a Hollywood studio find

269
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,400
themselves on sound stage during filming

270
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,570
and nobody thinks they're intruders

271
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,130
until it's way too late or a much dumber

272
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,900
cliche the scene is a humorous inside

273
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,550
joke because a pile of pink toilet paper

274
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,200
is exactly how the script was provided

275
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,880
to the cast is it just me or is there

276
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,470
something a bit off about this movie

277
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,090
they introduced a main antagonists like

278
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,650
Balthazar then go to another story

279
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,630
entirely with Gru's twin brother which

280
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,010
makes it seem like two different movies

281
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,240
were being made at the same time and

282
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,560
splice it together at the last minute of

283
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,630
course either I know this is played for

284
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,340
lamps but why did they pick Fritz to

285
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,990
constantly shit on in this movie does he

286
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,190
have a dark pass that we don't know

287
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,580
about

288
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,020
even though Drew's house is three times

289
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,790
as large as Cruz they still put the

290
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,380
girls in the same room together complete

291
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,090
with the dangerous triple bunk and a

292
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,470
ridiculous ladder no child should ever

293
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,900
climb it might not be good unicorn

294
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,840
finding weather oh yeah let's not forget

295
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,010
the C story in this movie

296
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,720
Agnes his attempt to find a unicorn I'm

297
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,860
beginning to wonder if they're going to

298
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,709
fit Sandman and venom into this thing

299
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,570
huh it's funny cuz its crew wait these

300
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,370
assholes were prosecuted for walking

301
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,230
onto the studio lot and convicted within

302
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,970
hours goddamn I thought this movie was

303
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,320
just going to be silly and annoying like

304
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,820
the other two despicable Me's but this

305
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,810
genuinely sucks

306
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,160
I've never seen a movie this short waste

307
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,740
so much time also man but sure are funny

308
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,339
aren't they

309
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,050
you've stopped your movie with stupid

310
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,760
little fucking animated banana Tic Tacs

311
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,860
just slap a butt on there an instant

312
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,029
comedy fuckin goal

313
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,800
cue movie there was no emotional

314
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,970
connection between GRU and the minions

315
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,589
before now and he certainly was never

316
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,149
shown taking any of them fishing also

317
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,860
according to this shot we've got roughly

318
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,089
five minutes before the earth is

319
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,649
swallowed by the Sun when the movie told

320
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,000
us that Agnes was going to seek out a

321
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
unicorn in the forest I thought that

322
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,550
meant with adult supervision

323
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,870
Lucy flipped out earlier when they

324
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,430
disappeared but I guess walking alone

325
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,080
into a forest that a one-eyed bartender

326
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,700
told you a unicorn lives in is perfectly

327
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:43,020
okay yeah no seriously how many

328
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,700
unnecessary subplots are there in this

329
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,959
movie that's mostly about the rivalry

330
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,399
between GRU and Pratt

331
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,750
Margot still hanging out with the dude

332
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,250
that gave of the cheese will Edith

333
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,779
continue her torturous pursuit of Fritz

334
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,580
well the few minions ever do anything

335
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,740
entertaining okay this is Brad's lair

336
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,839
wait I thought earlier it was a big deal

337
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,820
that he escaped because well you didn't

338
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,779
know where he would go after escaping

339
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,430
but you know where his lair is and the

340
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,020
AVL is a well-funded organization

341
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,579
committed to stopping villains so I

342
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,420
don't see the problem

343
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,589
even if his lair was considered

344
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,540
impenetrable you're about to do this job

345
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,279
with two people it may not look like

346
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,050
much but this place is armed with some

347
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,790
of the most high-tech weaponry known to

348
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,529
man how is it that Brett developed all

349
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:18,240
this evil tech by himself it's not like

350
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,589
his character was described as a super

351
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,450
genius he was just a failed child star

352
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,829
and even though he probably had some

353
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,720
scratch from evil Brett it only lasted

354
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,279
less than three seasons so the fact that

355
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,959
he's enormous ly wealthy is also some

356
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,279
bull oh damn I didn't realize Harvey

357
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,510
Weinstein had a son that lived in

358
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,579
Freedonia Oh mija mija how stupid is

359
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,459
this movie wait is brat Slayer seriously

360
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,779
with an easy boating distance of

361
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,399
Freedonia it's styled as a European

362
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,170
country and GRU lives in California so

363
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,920
where are we

364
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,470
I miss dominions I don't quick

365
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,450
camouflage ball I was he able to go into

366
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,310
camouflage mode and stay in sticky mode

367
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,720
when we saw GRU going through the

368
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,860
options it seemed pretty clear that you

369
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,480
could only pick one mode if you could do

370
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,889
both then why even bother doing this

371
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,290
mission without it even though the

372
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,089
Rockets are pointed specifically at drew

373
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,680
the scanning device has a flair for the

374
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,120
dramatic Lance starts on the other side

375
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,570
of the wall

376
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,579
manney sticky suit pure only sticky when

377
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,470
the plots demands him to be also grew

378
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,760
made the plan to break into Brandt's

379
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,290
lair before he even knew the suits

380
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,910
existed so how the hell did he think he

381
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,350
would get in this plan is highly

382
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,760
dependent on these suits well it looks

383
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,899
like someone's been reading the comic

384
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,519
guru drop and finally got to the section

385
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,199
on Grusin ining Balthazar's layer is

386
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,970
impenetrable except if you want to burn

387
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,949
a hole around an AC unit wow the minions

388
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:28,570
have been committed to this escape plan

389
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,190
considering this little guy is being

390
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,570
actively flown what kind of air

391
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,040
conditioning unit has a panel connected

392
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,820
to a carpeted floor

393
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,529
drew and GRU just happen to be here at

394
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,630
the exact time brat set his alarm to put

395
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,579
his evil plan into action also this

396
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,810
could have been a good time to turn on

397
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,220
that camouflage feature of these suits

398
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,839
after getting shot in the eye with this

399
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,490
laser causes tinnitus because the

400
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,720
writers have clearly lost control of

401
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,199
their senses not only did brat have all

402
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,790
these dolls programmed to kill he had

403
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,230
them all in boxes able to be

404
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,880
synchronized to voice commands keep in

405
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,320
mind that this technological genius

406
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,870
still watches VHS tapes

407
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,880
[Music]

408
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,320
Lucey ex machina but how did she know

409
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,640
they were here and what did she think

410
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,990
she was gonna do in this helicopter

411
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,790
didn't GRU tell her that this lair was

412
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,260
impenetrable and had a defense system

413
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,640
that would shoot missiles at anyone who

414
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,160
got close to the AVL and get the jobs

415
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,930
back yeah but GRU already had the

416
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,190
diamond after the last encounter with

417
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,510
brat it was the fact that he couldn't

418
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,920
catch him that got him fired

419
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,060
so this plan was faulty from the start

420
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,160
minions singing 99 bottles of beer on

421
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,840
the wall is a new chalkboard scratching

422
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,670
standard for the despicable me franchise

423
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,560
you there's so much kind of plain has a

424
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,530
chain lock now that's what I call acting

425
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,180
even if I believe Balthazar could

426
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,160
disguise himself exactly like Lucy I can

427
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,690
never believe he imitated her voice so

428
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,400
perfectly also this reveal is one of the

429
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,930
most brain twisting logic problems we've

430
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,670
ever encountered in a movie how did he

431
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,500
even get here especially this fast I

432
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,180
guess he could have been disguised as

433
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,070
Lucy here when Lucy saved them from the

434
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,410
spikes but I'd ask why bother and if he

435
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,640
used a helicopter from his own lair

436
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,720
there should have been another

437
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,460
helicopter waiting at Drew's mansion

438
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,050
when they landed because the idea that

439
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,370
he could have flown to Drew's stole his

440
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,960
helicopter and back to his own lair in

441
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,460
time as monumentally silly especially

442
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,050
since he didn't know drew existed five

443
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,370
minutes ago the plane they're currently

444
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,870
in is the same plane grew in his family

445
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,580
arrived on so he didn't use that to get

446
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,110
here so what the movie I mean even more

447
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,980
bullshit right

448
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,330
I guess if Balthazar snuck in

449
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,710
overpowered Lucy and stole her identity

450
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,570
she could assume he took the girls but

451
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,890
there's no way of knowing that since she

452
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,770
was tied up in the closet the whole time

453
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,000
so were the minions flying to Freedonia

454
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,890
but they didn't know that's where GRU

455
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,720
and company are goddamn this movie has

456
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,920
no sense of where people and creatures

457
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,200
are okay so how the fuck did GRU know

458
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,030
where Balthazar would remember Balthazar

459
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,280
took off Andrews plane then showed up to

460
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,590
Hollywood inside a giant evil brat which

461
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,910
means he had to go back to his lair to

462
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,440
get that then he spent the rest of the

463
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,180
time underwater from wherever his lair

464
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,010
is to Hollywood and crew should have no

465
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,870
idea where he was also where the fuck

466
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,220
are things in this world they go from

467
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,110
Miami to Freedonia to Hollywood to

468
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,580
wherever the fuck they want like it's a

469
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,400
trip to the local grocery store he's

470
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,500
going to whole city and set it up with

471
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,690
his face I saw this episode too it was

472
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,280
called age of Ultron people taking

473
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,330
selfies in front of really dangerous

474
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,460
cliche wait I thought this bubble gum

475
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,680
was sticky so Lucy should be going

476
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,090
absolutely nowhere in this scene all

477
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,530
these missiles make a direct hit on the

478
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,510
giant robot which must have all been set

479
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,730
to mildly inconvenience brat fell from

480
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,470
his perch by the Hollywood sign so how

481
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,000
is he able to continue to laser this

482
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,950
circle he's basically at sea level

483
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,640
oh good guess but how does GRU know that

484
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,500
this was Drew's doing he passed out from

485
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,910
the fall before drew even got close to

486
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,650
the robot when archaeologists dig up the

487
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,270
sedimentary layer were all buried under

488
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,620
ten thousand years from now they're

489
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,880
going to find way too many movies from

490
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,230
this era that somehow end with the

491
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,880
humorous dance fight great I went

492
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,080
through this whole movie just to see a

493
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,370
vill

494
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,720
being carried away by a giant bubble

495
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
long hanging from his ball sack I'm back

496
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,480
on the job
