12
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,880
Sony press conference so wow guys I

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,090

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,280
only one

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,159
[Music]

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,909
it was a disaster a couple of the games

17
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,739
yes yes that is true

18
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,039
so the games later on but you have to

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,699
endure the presentations compared to

20
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,649
previous years yeah I don't know how

21
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,140
many years you've seen the Sony press

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,390
conference but basically they they

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,159
fucked it up yeah and I fucked it up bad

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,799
they tried to do something different it

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,409
turned out to be boring realized they

26
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,450
had technical issues though did you hear

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:28,360
oh there's like mic interference the guy

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,640
with the flute they spent way too much

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,630
time on the banjo dude and the church

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,159
Allen was that not going for long sir

31
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,929
see here's the thing Joe watched it and

32
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,610
he can scan through it but he's not

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,119
forced to sit through a button so you

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,610
don't go yes if they move from Union

35
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,420
area area and won't they had to move we

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,700
as an audience who were watching it from

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,729
home had to sit there and wait for these

38
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,769
motherfuckers to get to the next fucking

39
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:59,500
room while talking heads jerked off

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,080
about the Sony conference and the Sony

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,289
this and saw me of that so you don't

42
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,289
know Sony in the past III s was really

43
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,000
straight to the fucking point and showed

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,470
off what they needed to they were like

45
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,510

46
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,250

48
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,769
conference yeah yes--there they were

49
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,060
like let's listen to a bunch of people

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,890
we don't care about talk let's have like

51
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,540
30 minutes of bullshit before the

52
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,629
conference and for musical segments that

53
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,069
nobody asked you where nobody cares

54
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,510
about because we're here for the game's

55
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,030
technical issues up the ass you got this

56
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,819
one you know guys screaming and the

57
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,980
language I've never heard of but maybe

58
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,379
he was picking up a different game or

59
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,120
something because it was pipe hear this

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,370
audio at the end the linear level no

61
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,290
like that's her that was our Manhattan

62
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,709
at Sartre New York City it pays for a

63
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,110
mission but we try to do things like you

64
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,940
saw in the raft or we show that back at

65
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,390
last e3 you can just swing around York

66
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,819
City and have fun let's go to that

67
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,060
footage because we are never running

68
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,359
yeah this went off stage and forgot to

69
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,950
turn off their microphones when they

70
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,510
were backstage yeah and they were saying

71
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,510
he's like I nailed it no you're mixing

72
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,389
that up with the dose off and that was

73
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,730
it that was a cute moment but so Sony

74
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,829
here's the thing and I wrote it here

75
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,540
this this is something I really needed

76
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,579
to stress this year you you really

77
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,060
fucked it up in terms of presentation

78
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,579
technical issues the only good part was

79
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,620
that once the conference started to get

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,220
going

81
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,799
you had the games the games were good

82
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,019
and and that's and so I just hope that

83
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,530
Sony isn't turning into its old ps3

84
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,959
out-of-touch self because I'm starting

85
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,389
to get a feeling of this which it seems

86
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:50,980
like that's what's happening recently

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,590
with this terrible three show I've

88
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,870
having a lot of problems with their PR

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,939
like shadowy you'll appear stuff like I

90
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,430
can't get I can't get access even though

91
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,799
I've had access before and then I have

92
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,290
to sneak into places I and you know that

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,180
spider-man interview that I did and the

94
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,340
dude was so happy exchange cars out

95
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,909
there so I had to fucking sneak in there

96
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,430
what is that what the fuck I had to go

97
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,849
through Sony UK and they were like a new

98
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,070

102
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,020

103
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,900

109
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,990

114
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,680
disrespect and I was so shocked I didn't

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,909
tell her who I wasn't saying anything

116
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,289
like that but they're just treating

117
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,330
people like shit out there and I was

118
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,400
like wow and and I don't have a Sony

119
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,560
contact anymore like I guess people have

120
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,770
left the company so so all that plus ear

121
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,490
butter this fortnight Bush

122
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,020
no this cross-platform stuff if you play

123
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,050
your fortnight on ps4 it's locked on ps4

124
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,970
you cannot play your account on the

125
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,639
Nintendo switch and they're not telling

126
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,319
people that that if you play your

127
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,479
fortnight account on ps4 you get locked

128
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,699
the fuck in and you have to start a

129
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,169
whole new account and start a whole new

130
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:31,880
everything and buy a whole new

131
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,590
everything on the fucking switch or

132
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,560
other platforms Sony is not playing nice

133
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,470
with cross-platform play and I could

134
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,569
have swore many years ago it was it was

135
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,460
Microsoft that wasn't playing I saw me

136
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,620
wanting to do it but maybe I'm wrong

137
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,220
about that because it seems you know

138
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,610
John Smedley he was recently quoted as

139
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,780
saying it's all about the money

140
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,000
I know I've known you I've worked with

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,099
them before they just do not want people

142
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,400
to buy a game and have it and then play

143
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,440
it on Xbox these networks or whatever

144
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,690
play with other people on there you need

145
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,430
to reverse your decision Sony you're

146
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,680
starting to you're starting to stink of

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
corporate bullshit you're starting to

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,080
stink of losing touch with gamers and if

149
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,550
you didn't have all these amazing

150
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,009
studios already working on amazing games

151
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,810
then I'd be really worried right now

152
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,599
because in my opinion Sony huge

153
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,030
disappointment this year yeah like their

154
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:33,139
show stuff so wise yeah I know you did I

155
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,289
know you did because I saw you dude with

156
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:40,819
a flute so so let's talk about the

157
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,740
actual Sony games that they showed and

158
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,280
why it wasn't a complete loss so they

159
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,400
start up with a banjo dude it's way too

160
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,880
long but they got to the last of us -

161
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,130
yeah immerse you in the immersed the 50

162
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,080
people they got to fit in that Stewart

163
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,630
and on air condition got me anyways Last

164
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,599
of Us - looked amazing in fact it looks

165
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,550
so good that people were saying it's

166
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,370
bull shot and they really doesn't look

167
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,710
like that it was some jealous developer

168
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,630
I forget what developer was from some

169
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,669
other companies like and and Sony had to

170
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,590
say or naughty dog had to come and say

171
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,729
no this is real you know and I saw at my

172
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,949
hotel you know a bunch of guys you know

173
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:22,670
relax

174
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,740
and having drinks and they had their

175
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,900
their shirt on the last of us - and

176
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,480
guess what Joe almost all of them have

177
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,750
seen our video and they were super super

178
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,400
cool they were like yeah yeah

179
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,230
cuz the other Joe played Elly and they

180
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,060
were really awesome people they were

181
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,610
genuinely excited about their game and

182
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,160
that all helped in addition to seeing

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,020
the conference which the gameplay blew

184
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,240
me away I was like that cannot be right

185
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
I mean facial expressions during the

186
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,700
attacking the animations and looked

187
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,020
amazing now I don't honestly but I

188
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,360
wasn't as hyped as I could have been

189
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,640
yeah the technology is impressive the

190
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,830
graphics are good but I don't I wanted

191
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,860
to see you know some of the we're

192
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,110
fighting human he's writing mostly and

193
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,930
then we have this story of Ali's she's

194
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,810
she's LBGT she's gay and she's kissing

195
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,420
up on a girl or maybe she's bi I don't

196
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,890
know she was talking with this one dude

197
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,230
I'm not interested in that I don't

198
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,590
really care about Ellie's love life you

199
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,360
know what I mean I think it's a better

200
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
story the connection between her and

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,430
Joel I agree and we never saw Joel and I

202
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,010
was like okay well shit is Joe in this

203
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,860
and our will be dead we're focusing on

204
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,120
the humans this time are we gonna be

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,850
focusing on this love story I don't care

206
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,800
I know they were going for it they were

207
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,600
going for like look at how sweet she is

208
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
stark contrast to how she's like a

209
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,710
brutal murder murderer when they said

210
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,610
they were going for the back-and-forth

211
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,800
like how she can make that but still be

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,960
like super fucked up right cuz she's you

213
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,530
know someone who could do that with zero

214
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,330
sensitive emotional impact and that's

215
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,730
why I do have I am encouraged by seeing

216
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,010
that stark contrast so we're gonna get

217
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,960
that in the game we're gonna really feel

218
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,420
some emotion but if it's a story about

219
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,300
Ellie's love life I'm I'm gonna be bored

220
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,360
in comparison to the first game so yeah

221
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,040
the first game remastered edition

222
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,450
cheating a little bit of tonight it was

223
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,030
good yeah so so that's what I think one

224
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,860
of their best ones then they go back to

225
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,990
talking head segments a bunch of Fagin

226
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,670
and Jacobs just talking about how great

227
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,130
sunny is this is more for like 5000 is

228
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,200
all going and they had a glare they did

229
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,699
it up

230
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,559
they didn't even bother using glare

231
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,209
protectors I showed you not on the

232
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,220
stream there is this huge glare for like

233
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,829
half the conference and we were sitting

234
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,269
there making fun of it's like I can't

235
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:45,129
see anyone this giant glare can't do

236
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,980
shit and I think one of the streams went

237
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,299
down I had to switch to a different

238
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,209
stream anyway then they go on to destiny

239
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,239
to forsaken sorry do you guys see this

240
00:09:55,239 --> 00:10:00,160
the trailer destiny oh yeah

241
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,109
well the trailer how they're gonna reel

242
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,540
you back in is they're gonna kill the

243
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,819
best fucking character in the game no

244
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:07,449
not really

245
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,449
kills no we're gonna kill cayde-6 he's

246
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,819
not in that in the lore many people this

247
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,769
to know and many people have told me

248
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,649
that if an EXO the type of race that

249
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,859
Kate is if they die their day was no

250
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,689
coming back as I said maybe he'll come

251
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,029
back as Kate 7 well the whole thing was

252
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,859
I thought the cave one through six was

253
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,439
iterations of him that had died is it

254
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,269
really like Keith for Keith fuck I can't

255
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,439
figure out the lore here because there's

256
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,959
no goddamn grimoire in the game fuck you

257

260
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:49,089
this point but do like your whole show

261
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,189
this is the only way that they can make

262
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,889
the story darker I'm really this is the

263
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,709
only way this is the only way and I said

264
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,169
okay well let me ask you this and none

265
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,119
of them had an answer for this if they

266
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,100
really cared about making a darker story

267
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,559
a really emotional impact and really

268
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,910
took their character seriously we're

269
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,319
gonna kill Kate we're gonna get an

270
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,079
emotional impact why did the fuck did

271
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,350
they reveal it in the trailer imagine if

272
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,639

273

everyone's saying oh this is fixing the

282
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,919
the game they're fixing a lot of issues

283
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,299
go back to right now no they already

284
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,339
sold you to fucking expansions were

285
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,220
overpriced garbage recycled they did

286
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,860
this exam

287
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,290
same fucking thing in the first destiny

288
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,149
all these fanboys are so blind they're

289
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,060
copying their exact model guarantee

290
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,500
either this is like the third expansion

291
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,209
they're gonna fix it like they did with

292
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,769
destiny one in their third fucking

293
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,540
expansion and then a month later or a

294
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,709
few months like if you might get another

295
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:01,700
one but then they're gonna announce

296
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,050
destiny three and they're gonna be like

297
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,670
oh don't worry we fixed it and then

298
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,630
they're gonna do the same shit with

299
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,950
destiny three they did and destiny -

300
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,959
it's gonna suck for the expansion well

301
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,730
there's rumors that the Bungie is I'm

302
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,589
gonna work on destiny 3 they want out of

303
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,149
it and they wanted they got the Chinese

304
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,709
investment but then they tried to smash

305
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,450
those rumors and say no no we're all

306
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,290
about destiny

307
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,990
well here's what you need to do if

308
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,490
Forsaken comes out and it doesn't

309
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,380
impress the fucking pants off of

310
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,149
everybody story wise and you put in the

311
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:28,010
god Banglore into the game and the

312
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,560
grimoire into the game then I think it's

313
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,350
done for second is your last chance and

314
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,980
and you've already basically spit on the

315
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,950
fans multiple times by not by doing all

316
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,240
that fucked up shit we wouldn't pay an

317
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,500
attention I can't even list them here

318
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,200
watch destiny channels destiny centric

319
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,990
channels will even tell you a fuck don't

320
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,490
listen to their community they were

321
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,649
doing underhanded shit - like lying

322
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,940
about it's a destiny video so yeah we

323
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,220
move on to the next great part of the

324
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,860
Sony conference ghosts of Tsushima Joe

325
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:18,290
flute but Tsushima Joe that Joe can't

326
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,670
but he doesn't like sushi can't

327
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,769
pronounce any of the testis words you're

328
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:22,970
gonna have a hard time playing the game

329
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,579
Joe ghost

330
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,670
yeah ghost of the badasses samurais what

331
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,910
do you think cuz like we even talking

332
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,870
about it non-stop

333
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,750
if assassins crime has another one let's

334
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,230
take it back Japan Japan and this is

335
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,180
basically what it looks like this is the

336
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,110
grandeur this is better graphics than

337
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,730
would have Assassin's Creed Japan would

338
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,070
have put out it looks like a more

339
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,380
involving story this is by a well known

340
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,069
studio that it that I think is capable

341
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,690
of making

342
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,380
the dis thing rose way up on my most

343
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,830
anticipated list I'm like I'm it's up

344
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,870
there with Red Dead Redemption Joe like

345
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,180
this is yeah this way way up so you got

346
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,430
the Mongol invasion you've got an

347
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,070
amazing sort of landscape and and

348
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,930
environments the grass isn't waving the

349
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,210
trees look of me you see that cherry

350
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,770
blossom tree they were fighting next

351
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:27,650
nice leaves and the leaves that leaves

352
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,660

354
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,130

355
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,620
whatever is trying to write trying to

356
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,310
kill this monk dude and and so really

357
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,460
interesting stories open world Japan

358
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,370
I hope this starts a whole new franchise

359
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,280
and we really get well this seems like

360
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,470
one and done you know I mean you can't

361
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,090
do a see quite of that oh the Mongols

362
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,550
invaded this island among those it made

363
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,700
it again crazy but no this really made

364
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,400
this Sony show worth it

365
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,760
you know this and Last of Us 2 was good

366
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,960
and then we do we go on to control

367
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:22,079
[Music]

368
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,319
from remedy and you know so remedy hot

369
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,749
off there quantum break which we and Joe

370
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:31,540
found incredibly boring but there was

371
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,339
some interesting segments of the Nissan

372
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:38,679
yes I hope that this is not I hope that

373
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,439
this is not fucking you know quantum

374
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,799
break to secretly within that world

375
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,230
I just want no more quantum break fuck

376
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,029
all that this needs to be control

377
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:51,579
control control nothing about quantum

378
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:54,069
breaking you you've got the physics

379
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,929
engine it was what impressed me the best

380
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,269
yeah I was like something inception feel

381
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,480
to it like assembling and reassembling

382
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,079
her gun is literally square components

383
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,079
that they reassemble so not much about

384
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,509
it other than it looks impressive

385
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,869
graphics wise so we'll see yeah female

386
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:17,170
really interesting made the whole

387
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,029
simulation looking thing not enough

388
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:21,249
there really to get super excited about

389
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:24,189
though so then we move on to something

390
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,139
that did get everybody super excited

391
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,410
this is how you do a remake oh yeah that

392
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,639
begins no this is I know this is how you

393
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,160
do a remake though Joe because it's been

394
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,350
so long since I've played Resident Evil

395
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,889
2 I literally remember nothing because I

396
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,889
didn't own up I didn't own a Sony

397
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,209
PlayStation at the time I had to go over

398
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,619
to a friend's and so I didn't play the

399
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,119
whole game only got bits and pieces of

400
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,769
the level I played through the first

401
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,239
Resident Evil completely on my own I

402
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,009
loved it but I never got to that sequel

403
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,529
oh they're going to a city now the cops

404
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,319
is Raccoon City what's going on so this

405
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,480
is my opportunity to really get the full

406
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,299
effect and flavor of the original so

407
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,610
it's gonna be even better for me than it

408
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,470
is any of you motherfuckers it'll play

409
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,000
well the thing is too is they're not

410
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,039
just only remaking it they're changing a

411
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,600
lot of the core system but more

412
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,579
modernized in style what the trailer was

413
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,019
showing off the gameplay they showed off

414
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,689
and so they're going above and beyond

415
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,939
they're using the Resident Evil 7 engine

416
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,529
from what it looked like and they're

417
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,419
doing it in a way that would feel good

418
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,159
for the modern gamer and they're redoing

419
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,450
the whole story and I honestly

420
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,399
can't wait I just can't wait to see what

421
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,289
they do with BAE how calm is killing it

422
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:38,110
look show there they are really just

423
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,690
turning around and just pumping out

424
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,000
exciting shit after so the monster owner

425
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,320
when our buddy to get to play it that

426
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,380

00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,639

454
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,210
look

455
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,809
I didn't even crack oh I was having a

456
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:58,659
good time so far and I know that this

457
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,669
divided people people were like I hate

458
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,679
that kind of comedy or no no it's not

459
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,480
funny wasn't even the matter of that

460
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,250
comedy no they make it good at Rick and

461
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,740
Morty but god it fucking fell so forth

462
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:18,940
no that's guy show you this demo things

463
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,799
I like this the way they talk I'm

464
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,840
excited for it I think this is a VR

465
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,529
title

466
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,809
I don't know hopefully things like VR

467
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,340
title and they showed a lot of

468
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,380
impressive VR titles but it didn't

469
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,659
really get into the Sony conference that

470
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,039
was probably a part of this isn't real

471
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,080
and there's a lot of really cool VR

472
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,309
titles that are coming up that I'm

473
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,990
excited for so what's happy to see that

474
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,080
but it curious that Sony kind of kept VR

475
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,830
out of their their main their main thing

476
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,529
focus on it so that was another misstep

477
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,019
from Sony in my opinion then they showed

478
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,090
Kingdom Hearts 3 and they had probably

479
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,500
one of the better presentations of

480
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,470
Kingdom Hearts 3 the square Enix Oh God

481
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,000
will talk about Square Enix later but

482
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,440
they just replayed the same fucking

483
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,149
trailer we've already seen here they

484
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:07,380
showed off Jack Sparrow or meet Jack

485
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,700
Sparrow I don't know if we play him I

486
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,820
have no idea okay well we'll see we'll

487
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,210
see and and so I was excited about this

488
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,539
you see some frozen stuff you see no

489
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,450

491
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:26,340

492
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,950

499
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,250
first two I'm not gonna know what I'm

500
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,049
not gonna know what's going on well

501
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,580
that's not our well that's the fault of

502
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,260
the fucking game there better be a recap

503
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,870
in there there better be a storyline you

504
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,880
you can follow but the one thing I gotta

505
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,559
say about Kingdom Hearts 3 and I've

506
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,169
played it they're one of the boss

507
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:56,850
battles was awful like you're you're

508
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,289
running up and you're attacking the

509
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,899
dude's foot it's it's like really like

510
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,639
this is the game design wanna want them

511
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,380
what not to do with the boss now it

512
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,059
opens up later and now you're flying on

513
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,039
a frog and train and you're firing

514
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,809
fireworks and I was like alright this is

515
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,519
fucking how you do it but they're

516
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,830
they're they're moments in that gameplay

517
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,510
demo that was on the floor there that I

518
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,320
got my hands on that I was like oh is

519
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,510
this what everybody's excited about then

520
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,330
we get to the story Joe and the story

521
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,029
and the voice acting is I'm gonna play

522
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,799
this shit in Japanese there better be a

523
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,630
Japanese option you know what I'm saying

524
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,409
that's the best because this shit is so

525
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:38,010
melodramatic small written so poorly and

526
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,289
basic that I'm like Oh fine yeah my

527
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,779
heart is yeah how the heart my heart of

528
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,710
your heart is my heart so you know

529
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,470
the Kingdom Hearts has always been like

530
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,190
the elegant

531
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,380
and it appeals to very specific people

532
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,990
into a younger generation the game is

533
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,060
much nostalgic for the nostalgic and

534
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,040
it's not supposed to be complex or crazy

535
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,330
right I know I know I sometimes grew up

536
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,920
in their rabid about whether their

537
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,270
childhood when they grew up with these

538
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,430
games but for adults who are coming in

539
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,680
and when you're opening up a wider fan

540
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,090
base because there's a new old means

541
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,580
they want more people to come into the

542
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,830
into the the thing no they it is for me

543
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,570
these days because you know how old

544
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,970
Kingdom Hearts is it is very but the

545
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,220
thing is it's gonna be pretty

546
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,380
interesting I'm gonna last fall I'm

547
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,850
gonna have a great time with Kingdom

548
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,120
Hearts I'm not I'm just gonna whatever

549
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,850
happens happens with that game yeah then

550
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,760
we go to death stranding and you know

551
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,920
movie is its walking simulator so we

552
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,930
negative or say why are we saying this

553
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,820
negative stuff about it we're so excited

554
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,100
about it it was so mysterious

555
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,410
now when they show gameplay we're

556
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,130
walking over o open empty areas with a

557
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,370
big old backpack on her back and I don't

558
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,980
know I was a little less excited after

559
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,070
the gameplay so I'm gonna say what I

560
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,290
said from the beginning just because

561
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,060
someone's been good at something before

562
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,560
doesn't mean that they can blow it away

563
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,450
in a new title would be good at it again

564
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,560
and everything that we've been hyping up

565
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,020
a kojima and everything is because it

566
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,670
was like oh he did this oh he showed

567
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,980
shock value trailers and stuff but

568
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,570
there's not been any gameplay until this

569
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,490
point there was like no reason to get

570
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,770
hyped until this point no I think you're

571
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,630
I think you're wrong on that now I think

572
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,700
they did it did an excellent job in some

573
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,180
of the cinematic trail monsters this new

574
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,310
style technology what the fuck is going

575
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,710
on I still have faith in this game but

576
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,260
I'm just saying reveal wise technical

577
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,150
wise presentation-wise it it took a

578
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,770
little bit and I wouldn't say drop the

579
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,420
ball it just took a little chunk out of

580
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,800
my exciting I don't want to see any more

581
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,370
until it comes out yeah

582
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,960
because I want to be surprised at

583
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,429
everything and I want to go through this

584
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,500
so so they did show some new female

585
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,270
characters that will be traveling with

586
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,840
them to different characters and you

587
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,030
know one one eats a fucking beetle in

588
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,770
the weirdest mocap look maybe I don't

589
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,200
stare at you while you eat but to me

590
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,429
it's like it doesn't matter how

591
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,470
impressive your CGI trailers are because

592
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,000
look at things like Star Wars The Old

593
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,750
Republic

594
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,510
best fucking trailers ever made for a

595
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,850
video game the game sucked yeah so for

596
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,130
me until I see the game I don't know

597
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,600
about sug but it was a his

598
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,150
disappointment yeah yeah never wonder

599
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,159
neo2 they didn't really talk much about

600
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,610
it or show much of it off its death are

601
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,169
you gonna conquer death some would def

602
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:42,179
going on this next time around first

603
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,669
game was fantastic yeah so it could be

604
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,620
very interesting could be another hit

605
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,770
for them then we go to spider-man

606
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,510
amazing game I got that interview got my

607
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,890
hands on it for the first time I know

608
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,929
we've seen spider-man the last year in

609
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,850
the year after that but this is the

610
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,289
first year we're about to get this thing

611
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,900
and I'm telling you guys this thing has

612
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,980
potential it is so long did you see my

613
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,100
interview all that footage is me doing

614
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,799
stuff and and I that was the first I

615
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,049
know that was the first time I touched

616
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:18,870
the controller and I had to momentarily

617
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,850
possible was happening you can you see a

618
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,600
new cookie looks omitted so much fun

619
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,720
guys it's very really I would I would be

620
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,970
surprised if this thing gets any less

621
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,530
than a nine for me they would have to

622
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,840
really fuck up and be one of the

623
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,789
shortest experience and have one of the

624
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:41,070
war stories guys pre-order yeah I know

625
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,710
it's it's pre-order bull spider-man

626
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,690
exclusive this is another exclusive

627
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,640
thing so let's talk a little bit about

628
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,470
the exclusives that we've seen so far

629
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,360
with Sony and this is why it's not a

630
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,799
complete disaster

631
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,559
the presentation was a disaster their

632
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,309
games were better yes okay so last of us

633
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,370
that's exclusive Ghost of Tsushima

634
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,330
that's exclusive control we don't know

635
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,669
I don't think so resident evil that's

636
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,789
exclusive a bathtub guy I think that's

637
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:12,470
exclusive but we don't know we don't

638
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,059
know on that one let's withdraw that

639
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:15,799
Kingdom are Surrey not exclusive that's

640
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:22,399
stranding that is not I don't think neo

641
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,460
- that's probably exclusive but they

642
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,179
ported show they need to put more

643
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,580
emphasis in their show exclusive you

644
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,139
know kind of thing right well then you

645
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:34,730
get the Microsoft thing where this is

646
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,509
everything as a console exclusive yeah

647
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:41,330
they say yeah console launch exclusive

648
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,700
they have like 98 technologies like

649
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,590
infuse lion and so yes after spider-man

650
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,619
was talking heads again and then but it

651
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,570
was such a poor ending you didn't know

652
00:26:53,570 --> 00:27:02,809
is the show but then they're talking for

653
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:04,039
a long time and then they kind of show

654
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,600
start showing trailers of other things

655
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,190
and then when they recap you're like

656
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,559
okay I think this shit is over but then

657
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,330
they but then they had a reveal after

658
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,440
that when you think it's always like a

659
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,850
doll scene disini From Software's some

660
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,129
artsy-fartsy thing from software I I

661
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:21,200
don't know what it's about but I just

662
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,999
didn't even know when the damn thing

663
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:27,590
ended so yeah really I'm concerned for

664
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,379
Sony I felt I smelled all their

665
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:32,929
corporate bullshit I smelled all their

666
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,259
detachment from gamers and it really

667
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,399
concerned me and I'm not talking about

668
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,580
Sony UK Sony UK if you're in the UK Sony

669
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,989
treats you right thank you

670
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,269
they really do seriously I guess in the

671
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:45,859
u.s. there's just too many people coming

672
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,690
to get the fuck out of here just get

673
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,519
away from us and in the UK there's not

674
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,720
enough they're like yeah come on come on

675
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,100

yeah we got great games come on you know

677
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,489
I mean that is the impression I'm

678
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:59,080
getting from Sony if some if a Sony

679
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,249
represent agree with that please email

680
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,259
me let's let's get into touch here

681
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,710
because you're losing me man and and I

682
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,480
was all about Sony you know what I mean

683
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,239
this this new generation it fucking

684
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,369
flipped I was a huge xboxone fanboy and

685
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:15,889
now I feel like Sony is killing it and

686
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:18,379
and Xbox is you know not they're trying

687
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,119
to get back on their feet and we'll talk

688
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,859
about Microsoft because they are getting

689
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:24,590
back on their feet and I'm I'm starting

690
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,539
to get the hints and smell of a

691
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,850
turnaround and let's well no way I want

692
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,320
you don't think so not till the next

693
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,049
ghost challenge man no by the way with

694
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,470
those amazing reveals and those

695
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,409
exclusive games I still think that Sony

696
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:45,889
won in games not in presentation in

697
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,559
presentation it was Microsoft which was

698
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,240
super super surprising to me so I would

699
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,999
actually put so I'm actually putting

700
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:02,929
Sony up a little higher than than I

701
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:06,499
originally had so that's our impressions

702
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:08,029
of the Sony conference what would you

703
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:15,799
give it out of 10 Wow

704
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,619
five or six I mean you just watching it

705
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:21,769
from a stream end live yeah I hated it

706
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:23,029
like the whole presentation

707
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,289
I loved the games I hated the

708
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:26,659
presentation and judging by everybody

709
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:27,889
that was in the stream watching it

710
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,570
really what the fuck is going on why is

711
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,129
this so unprofessional where are the

712
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:32,720
games when you factor in the

713
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,609
presentation in the games then that's

714
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,470
where the score gets lowered for me I'm

715
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,220
a 6 6 out of 10 for Sony job probably

716
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,509
hasn't had some of the same experiences

717
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,220
previous and you got to skip it and

718
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,349
there's previous Sonic conferences where

719
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:50,210
they've absolutely nailed it oh and when

720
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,119
you compared it to this one it's like Oh

721
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:55,369
Chris happening here and I'm hoping it's

722
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,200
just because they tried to do something

723
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,309
different this year

724
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:01,309
you fucking failed okay don't do that

725
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:01,639
again

726
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,559
do much better next time around

727
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,950
otherwise I will be legitimately worried

728
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,169
about I'm starting to get worried I'll

729
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:12,379
be legitimately worried about you but

730
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,419
luckily your your first party studios

731
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,239
are killing you first party titers are

732
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,710
killing it you've got a third party

733
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,859
titles fine but your first party is

734
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:24,200
killing it so you maybe don't have to

735
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,509
worry but don't get complacent don't get

736
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:27,950
complacent that's what I'm saying for

737
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,870
Sony all right

738
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,490
thank you so much for watching we will

739
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:38,500
see you on the next angry Joe show
