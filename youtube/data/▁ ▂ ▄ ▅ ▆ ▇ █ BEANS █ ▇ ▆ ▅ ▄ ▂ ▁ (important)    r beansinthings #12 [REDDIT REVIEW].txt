00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,560
Hello my fellow bean lovers, (did you just assume-) I'm sorry for making assumptions

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,580
But if you clicked on this video, I'm just going to assume that you're a fellow

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,660
passionate follower of the one and only BEANS

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,480
Our favorite hobbies is

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,240
Eating beans and watching Cars and trying to avoid ridicule.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,540
Of course, there are haters (grrr) that doesn't (pewds I think you mean &quot;don't&quot; but okay) like beans

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,600
*pulls out a very detailed map of the world*

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,550
This is our plan of destruction, we will take over from this front

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,520
moving over to here

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,740
If you guys like beans, please go ahead and leave a like on this video right now

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,520
if you like bean so much, huh?

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,240
Why don't you go ahead and like this video, then

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,560
I bet you don't even like beans that much

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,240
I bet you don't even sleep with your beans. I bet you don't even eat beans while eating beans (I can't believe you pewds)

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,940
Pathetic. Well, I guess it's time for that to change (god has come)

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,280
Let's go through some inspo (inspiration) of THE BEANS

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,620
*new level of running out of ideas*

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,980
Want to thank whoever poured baked beans all over the slides at this park

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,980
and didn't clean it up

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,740
Very funny!

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,350
Have you done your part? Have you done your duty?

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,320
Have you been spreading beans across the world like this fellow, bean lover? I don't think so (Pewds is disappointed)

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,420
So don't even talk to me unless you put beans somewhere

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,780
That seemingly it wouldn't belong. I salute this bean sliding man or wahman

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,220
We accept anyone

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,040
A picture worth a thousand beans

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
Listen up. Listen up.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,920
Unless you treat beans like the art form it is

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,620
Then we're not gonna get anywhere in this.

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,820
I just want to eat it, but I can't.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,160
that's ART

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,340
We have to keep our guilty pleasure a secret. Sometimes hiding beans in our snacks

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,820
So people won't judge us well (too late Pewds)

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,720
Well- *laugh of relation*

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,160
I've done this myself while watching Cars 1 and 2 at the cinema.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,100
First time. I was ridiculed 
Second time. I came prepared

37
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,900
Life Hack came for free but of course, we don't only just

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,260
eat beans.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,240
That's right everybody

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,020
We drink beans

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,820
And you know, why? 
Because they have a lot of P R O T E I N in them.

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,940
Not s*y beans, you see these giant muscles? You see these?

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,580
(oH sTOp FLeXiNg pEWdS i aM sO jEAlOuS)

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,000
That's cuz of the protein in the beans

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,360
Oh my god. That is disgusting

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,289
That's what a level-one bean lover would say,

47
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:35,820
I however, am at least five ranks up in the bean-verse and this is a

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,320
Lovely dip to put your feet in

49
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,200
I would just love to slide it smoothly right into those Crocs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
Sliding to a woman's DM's-ahah.
No, thank you.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Sliding to a croc filled with beans. Ah- That's right a very good

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,600
What is this video? I'm trying to figure it out as I'm going.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Frequently bought together

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Unless this says on your Amazon account.

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,460
Then you're just a fake fan (disgusting), a fake follower, a poser.

56
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,880
always

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,340
$19.99. That's a great- that's a great deal.

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,620
Excuse me, while I have a bite on this delicious Apple.

59
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,960
Oh That's right. You thought I was eating Apples?

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,880
Nah

61
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,320
NAH FAM

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm eating beans.

63
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,080
There's always beans. If a bean disliker were to slice me in half right now

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,520
I wouldn't bleed. I would bleed beans

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,060
I wouldn't bleed blood, I would bleed beans. It's in my veins

66
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,760
It's in my system. It's in my DNA

67
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,960
I eat beans only n-words who eat beans can like this picture

68
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,160
That is me giving the video a thumbs up

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,460
Just like you should. If you like beans unless you're a faker daker

70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,460
This man has so much beans in his body

71
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,560
That it's coming out of his eyes

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,020
and he has to keep them contained which I can respect 100%

73
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,320
Some say; This is the profit in the bean-mi-verse

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,120
some say he can see the future...

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,440
through the beans (so he's a bean Dr.Strange?)

76
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,960
Sometimes we just have to abandon

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,020
the beans

78
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,100
but rest assured we'll come back for the beans

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,020
Man, this is some...

80
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,520
These beans are fire

81
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,100
Nothing like some cold beans.

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,080
Sometimes you get distracted from what's important in life

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,960
Looking to renovate your home, well here's a cheap life hack for you.

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,080
Just crack open a can of beans

85
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,640
This sub brings me so much joy

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Who needs money?

87
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,680
Everyone is talking about all these new currencies.

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,880
Bitconnect

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,960
BTC

90
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
but what does it really stands for?

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,840
That's right. 
Beans

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,670
Times

93
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,620
Trumps 
Coins

94
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,780
Beans Trump's Coins.

95
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,740
That's right. Everybody. We're.. I'll accept beans from now on instead of donations

96
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,540
Want your home to smell lovely and nice?

97
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,780
Bean up, baby. BEAN UP

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,800
*smells around*

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Margaret, may I say, this house smells Wonderful!

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,320
Is is bEaNS?!

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,240
Here we have beans

102
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,020
inside of beans. That's hilarious.

103
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,060
Why are you still watching this video? It's all beans 
(It's love, Pewds. Even if the vid's not that great)

104
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,780
How do you wash your clothes? That's right. Everybody with beans.

105
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,160
That's how I keep my white shirt so clean

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,780
Thanks to beans.

107
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,220
Arigaotu Bean-sama

108
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,020
Cupholder, is what a moron would use it for

109
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,720
Bean cup dispenser

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,060
Yeah~

111
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,620
Nothing like drinking some beans, everybody

112
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,560
Some classic Coca Cola flavored beans.

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
Oh my god, Jack. Now

114
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,700
I'm just getting annoyed. What did they- stop?

115
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,300
I mean, no. That looks great. That looks delicious

116
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,160
Pistachios. B-stichios. BEANSTACHIOS
Delicious. Delicious, everybody!

117
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,640
*pewds in disgust* What the hell stop

118
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
Abort! Abort!

119
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,380
Oh My God

120
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,260
Stop, please. Stop, please

121
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,080
Wonder what kind of games will launch?

122
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
Freshly squeezed beans, everybody. Wow.

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,460
*kiss* (magnifique)

124
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,680
Nothing, like a- nothing gets me going in the morning like some freshly squeezed beans.

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,580
oof

126
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,920
nothing to stop a child from being conceived

127
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,980
like shoving some beams up there

128
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Up top, everybody! If you do it right now.

129
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,100
Nothing like some- well that's coffee beans

130
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,800
That doesn't count. Get out of here.

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,520
Nothing like some beans in the banana lamp.

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,760
What is wrong with me?

133
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,740
I think- think I'm losing it. 
(Why are we still here?)

134
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,500
Nothing likes some beans to tell the time.

135
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,420
Oh my god

136
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,440
What's so great about beans is that if you spill your drink,

137
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,840
there's always more beans

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,320
*pewds refreshed*

139
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,740
Nothing quenches my thirst like a fresh can of beans with the boys.

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,660
Hmm, yummy

141
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,440
*family friendly words of encouragement*
(oh dear)

142
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
Are you kidding me?!

143
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,740
God dam it

144
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,320
It's not even Christmas

145
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,780
Unless you put beans in your Christmas ornament

146
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,500
It's not your birthday unless you get a bean birthday cake.

147
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,180
And it's not a summer without a bean ice cream

148
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,140
Beans is everything the essence of life.

149
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,480
How do you think the Germans lost the war?

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,280
*World War II flashbacks*

151
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,180
Because this is what they were fighting, (THE BEANS RETURN) They clearly stood no chance.

152
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,040
What do you think was in the a-bomb that hit in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,080
That's right beans. 
Beans'- just- everything

154
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,140
Man, that's a big bean...

155
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,640
You think I ran this joke to the death yet? (Yes. Good job. *clap  clap*)

156
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,240
Now, go forth my fellow bean lovers

157
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,420
You have been trained in the art of bean loving

158
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,440

Tell your friends and family to watch this video and tell them about the beans.

160
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
That's right.

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,720
If your friend send you this video,

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,880
that means they care for you.

163
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,860
That means they love you.

164
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,240
That means they want what's best for you. That's right

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,060
Now excuse me. I'm gonna have to go and find some more beans.

167
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,460
There's always beans to hunt.

168
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,300
I'm also creating a game called Bean-Bean Hunt *pewds with 300 IQ*

169
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,720
It's kind of like Pokemon go but with beans instead

170
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,260
I hope you guys will like that and as always, Bean Fist.

171
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,180
Thank you guys for watching.

(What the heck was the point of this video.) (Probably to kill the meme.)

189
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,740
(Like seriously, Pewds) (Hush, child. He knows exactly what he's doing...I think)

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,620
A$$

191
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:57,080
(When beans didn't give you enough content so you have to show off a spicy game to get the video to the ten minute mark)

00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,440

00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:49,640
(Seriously. Why are you still here?)

197
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,580
(Go)

198
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,300
(Are expecting Sam Jackson to pop in here)

199
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:02,000
(wearing a saucy leather number?)
