I hate keeping secrets in these videos

35
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,319
but I don't want to sort of let the cat

36
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,790
out of the bag as to exactly what the

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,739
holiday video is because there's too

38
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,870
many things that could go wrong and then

39
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,989
you would be upset at at me and Jesse a

40
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,120
little bit but mostly at me but we're

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,489
going to Long Beach right now and we're

42

going to learn how to do something that

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,980
sort of has something to do with what

44
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,870
the holiday video is I sound like a jerk

45

I never got in the water which is

60
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,200
tremendously disappointing but the

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,420
purpose of coming here was to learn how

62
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,790
to handle a kite and I did learn that

63
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,140
even though I didn't get wet he did

64
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,060
pretty good actually I feel like I did

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,790
pretty good

66
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:11,350
[Music]

I don't think of today as a failure I

68
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,130
think I did learn a lot and that was the

69
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,120
purpose of that this is Andy here before

70
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
we go to dinner though you should meet

71

86
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,330
this morning there's a couple more

87
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,310
production meetings this is sort of it

88
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,889
for the prep for the holiday video shoot

89
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:29,850
the shoot is in three days

90
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,990
get this SoDo costuming custom costuming

91
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,520
for the shoot and Jessie seeing a photo

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,110
of what the costuming looks like he

93
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,020
probably needed

94
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,530
we have Chelsea here babysitting we're

95
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,310
going to the Grove now to see the see

96
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,230
Samson's VR installation there and then

97
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,500
Jesse and I still have some more I guess

98
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,330
we could do it on the airplane on Sunday

99
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,760
right the shot list yeah and then I

100
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,620
think all the prep that we could do is

101
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,160
done this is the night before our for

102
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,060
DVR experience our video is

103
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,530
unapologetically a Christmas video but

104
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,620
and it sort of involves a sleigh Santa's

105
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,800
sleigh but not this one you get dizzy at

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,760
any point in time just close your eyes

107
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,290
has anybody thrown up yet all right

108
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,180
again with the hints for what we're

109
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,880
doing this is a virtual of virtual

110
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,290
experience where you get to be Santa

111
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,340
Anas sleigh right and this is sort of

112
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,890
practice for what our movie is is that

113
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:48,400
given too much away it might be

114
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,580
[Music]

115
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,740
