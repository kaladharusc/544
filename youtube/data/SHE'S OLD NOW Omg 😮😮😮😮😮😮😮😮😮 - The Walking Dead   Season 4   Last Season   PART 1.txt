29
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,409
couldn't save everyone because of the

30
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,619
okay

31
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,770
so I remember this it was so long ago

32
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,649
but I saved Carly which didn't matter

33
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,330
because she just died anyway everyone

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,159

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
dead a woman in our group named

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,070
oh that's bad word and then she just

37
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,830
couldn't cope yeah yeah she betrayed me

38
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,990
took the life that li saved good that

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,270
made me super angry we left her behind I

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,369
remember is that you shot her

41
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,649
you shot Carly which I deliberately same

42
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,170

43
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,810
come back taught me how to survive he

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,569
protected me as long as he could but he

45
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,650
got bit we don't need to hear this again

46
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,690
don't not even in the end he was still

47
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,110
teaching

48
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,540
[Music]

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,569
shape your hair short o pioneers if I

50
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:37,239
still remembered just not worth the risk

51
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,659
I'm not gonna cry I'm a man now that's

52
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,920
some manchild the end he made one final

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,370
request

54
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,850
shop he asked me to shoot him and I did

55
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,590
so we're going through all the choice

56
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,680
group after that broken people running

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,590
from their past there was a woman who

58
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,410
gave birth to a boy named Alvin jr. AJ

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,820
he made it but the mom didn't I remember

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,709
this season shit was good I did like I

61
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,160
started to take care of him I don't care

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,709
about AJ that much I'm sorry I know Jane

63
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,440
left AJ in the snow we thought he was

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,600
gone forever that was the last straw for

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,290
Kenny and without Lee around I had to

66
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,070
make the call

67
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,140
technically if you got the ending here's

68
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,150
the thing I played it - I played it

69
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,170
twice I wanted to see all the ending so

70
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,920
I think I what I did first time was that

71
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,380
I shot Kenny and then the second time I

72
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,780
heard Jane die and I really like both

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,049
endings I kind of want to keep Kenny

74
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,700
alive no I have to

75
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,340
don't make me make the same choice twice

76
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,670
Ola doula Dolph king kelana cough cough

77
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,590
Alana break your bone at all a doula

78
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,910
Dolph okay chanting AJ was alive Jane

79
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,370
hit him to make a point knowing what

80
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,140
they'd done

81
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,530
it was a nice ending anyway I stayed

82
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,180
weekend till decided we were better

83
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,250
together for AJ sake

84
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,500
I like everything else I like that

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,410
ending don't just you guys need to stop

86
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,890
tonight

87
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,560
each one carries new frontier I thought

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,810
we'd found something that worked but I

89
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,000
was wrong again

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,970
they tell Jeff from me said I was too

91
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,790
young to take care of him

92
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,220
you're only nine you can't take care of

93
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,360
no child well I fought for AJ I remember

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,230
oh I fought back oh she's spitting I

95
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,000
wasn't strong enough I searched for a

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,900
long time

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,850
it's all coming back now just when I

98
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,650
gave up hope

99
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,900
I found him

100
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,350
we're searching together now

101
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,660
a place we can call him is that her now

102
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,570
only J has

103
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,100
she's still growing up

104
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,790

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,730

t know how to handle yourself I usually

450
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,520
see people our age alone out in the wild

451
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,270

what don't worry about it

453
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,800
we all do what we have to how kind of

454
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:32,230
common was that in Maine

455
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,940
they're all very accepting of the new

456

person it's good we found you when we

457
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,830
did wasn't easy getting you two out of

458
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,490
that wreck on the way the car was a

459
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,980
totaled yeah fuck had to work fast I

460
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,750
don't know what would have happened if

461
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,470
we hadn't seen the smoke I appreciate it

462
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,620
all alone with the kid never have you

463
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,320

466
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,690
haven't seen anything like you and ever

467
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,510
what is this place you can probably tell

468
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,929
it used to be a school now it's whatever

469
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,679
we want it to be and who's in charge

470
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,429
well I am you probably sounds strange

471
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,639
kids run by kid but we do all right for

472
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,230
ourselves okay

473
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,780
got good walls good defenses a good

474
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,000
location - no one really comes out this

475
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,280
way anymore it carved ourselves the

476
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,460
perfect camp kids are safe here and make

477
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,149
sure of it

00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:53,510
no adults at all how did this Cyrus like

479
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,200
this dumb people leave they die there's

480
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,380
less of us all around I got us a system

481
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,510
in place that works well enough fine

482
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,240
allow me to make it formal welcome to

Erickson's boarding school for troubled

484
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,970
youth your boy feels like you both fit

485
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,640
that description it's hard to survive

486
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,589
too long these days without being a bit

487
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:19,099
and she and I are angels I was pretty

488
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,200
good as a kid before everything changed

489
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,349
made a lot of trouble since then we all

490
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:26,990
had to grow up fast I'd say that goes

491
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,420
double for your boy it's been a little

492
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,510
terror since he arrived excuse me

493
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,069
let's just say he hasn't been happy

494
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:43,010

one thing that always bothered me about

632
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,670
Walking Dead is the fact that they

633
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:11,249
merely get blood everywhere okay but you

634
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:12,839
can never get infected from getting like

635
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,999
blood in your eye like other diseases

636
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:18,479
would spread I know that would be a lame

637
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:23,400
way for someone to be infected but it

638
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,609
just ruins the immersion Tulalip a let's

644
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:45,930
to do it like they'll tape up their arms

645
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,759
perfectly with like duct tape or

646
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:49,890
whatever they'll use all the smart

647
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,650
things that no one fucking thought about

648
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,150

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,260
except when she's mulling walkers that

661
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,230
is you would have to do that right that

662
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,849
Walker came out of nowhere all right all

663
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:41,780
right funs over

664
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:47,200
let's get inside you're not the only one

665
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,480
fuckin language is it how hard is it go

666
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,280
out there how do you think it went

667
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,670
be nice a sim save stones nearly dry I

668
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,099
could barely find enough for tonight

669
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:59,210
we're gonna have to scout out further if

670
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,599
we want food for the winter talk about

671
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:02,960
it later

672
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,550
oh shit we should talk about this right

673
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:09,260
now I said later damn it still standing

674
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,530
I see

675
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,030
I'd call that a b-plus performance

676
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:18,760
thereby you've done better fuck off

677
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,310
b-minus then now Clem here that was a

678
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:27,880
solid a a-plus even surely agriculture

679
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,960
Milan you were great you kicked ass

680
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,260
violet a plus yeah wham and power upon

681
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:38,480
what here both delusional surely

682
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,010
agriculture would be the most important

683
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,570
skill during a zombie apocalypse cuz

684
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,920
then you could just harvest food and

685
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:49,640
those things that you do now you don't

686
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,440
have to always scavenge for cans or

687
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,990
whatever

688
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,060
you you lock off an area and you never

689
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,710
have to leave they're pretty good

717
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,630

how would you guys feel about this

721
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,390
setting on all these new characters it's

722
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,210
pretty interesting but you know if it

723
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,520
was my game I would make it so everyone

724
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,260
had like perfect that everything at this

725
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,329
point it's the last season surely these

726
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:21,980
people would understand how to survive

727
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,160
more than putting nails in a chair like

728
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,730
and call it Charles

729
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,559
all right let's apologize to Jason Smit

730
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,430

731
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,079
Webb AJ this is Omar excuse me chef

732
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,089
Omar hello and no it's not ready yet

733
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:43,040
Omar's a perfectionist the slightest

734
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,599
flavor out of place and he's grumpy for

735
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:46,880
a week you can eat her you can eat right

736
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,460
well it'll cost you as a little patience

737
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:58,770
I'll let you guys know when we're done

738
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,440
here's another thing right so he's

739
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,390
supposed to be cooking but where are all

740
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,160
the ingredients like where are all the

741
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,990
foods if he actually cared about making

742
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,790
the food good you'd see that he did have

743
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,640
some stuff here I think this game misses

744
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,070
a lot of small stuff attention to detail

745
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:18,869
I don't know why I'm being so critical

746
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:25,740
I'm just saying all right no I want to I

747
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,170
want to talk to Marvin or whatever his

748
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,040

760
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,040
make more sense you have to get up close

761
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:17,170

762

and fewer places to hunt which means

805
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,490
we're gonna have fewer and fewer things

806
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,220

922
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,700
than my kid it's nice to see him act

923

this room Soviet like paintings and shit

1039
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,980
on the walls lots of color and Minerva

1040
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:12,370
she was really musical not like Lewis

1041
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:18,220
though she had actual talent she had the

1042
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,670
most amazing voice real bluesy marlon

1043
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:23,350
always joked that he would scavenge a

1044
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,820
guitar and the two of them would tour

1045
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:29,430
the country that was a long time ago

1046
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:33,520
after they afterwards Brody intend took

1047
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,440
down all the paintings and that was the

1048
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,470
end of it I shouldn't have even brought

1049

1050
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:46,630

1052

the world went to shit he bailed all the

1169

here

1177
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,040

01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:53,019
I don't know

1186
01:20:53,019 --> 01:20:55,239
that's the train station there was a

1187
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:56,619
whole stash of food under the

1188
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,530
floorboards nobody crashed your car

1189
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:01,360
pretty sure that place of lost cause I

1190
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,489
handle a lot of smoke coming from when

1191
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:06,489
we found you two walkers flooded in

1192
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:09,030
there after all the noise you made it

1193
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,949
well we can't check in what's out here

1194
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:15,309
well that's where we fish got shot for

1195
01:21:15,309 --> 01:21:18,030
storage right here right along the river

1196
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:20,949
it's secure mostly get the occasional

1197
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:24,280
walker to come by vine Brody should be

1198
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,730
heading up there in a bit

1200
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,090
that's the only road that leads in and

1201
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,400
out of Ericsson you go off it you will

1202
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,680
eventually end up in the valley

1203
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,060
you just have signs that let people to

1204
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:39,000
the school but and took it down wanted

1205
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,980

1206
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:46,050
pretty good what's the trap area come on

1207

1212
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,250
I didn't realize how much forest

1213
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,800
surrounds this place it's how we've kept

1214
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,570
ourselves from unwanted attention for so

1215
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:03,510
long

1216
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:08,449
Oh for the most part anyway

1217
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,580
greenly have a greased house oh yeah

1218
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,800
well don't get too excited about that

1219
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,679
one we used to maintain it real well

1220
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,780
plenty of vegetables growing but it

1221
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,820
became overgrown

1222
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:23,780
was possible y-yeah yeah we keep away

1223
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,090
from that now you could sort it out dude

1224
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:29,420
one more thing see these red lights yeah

1225
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,420
so everything inside isn't safe so it's

1226
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,099
getting smaller over the years and the

1227
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:37,159
food's become more scarce so why not go

1228
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:42,980
outside it whenever someone goes outside

1229
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,040
the safe zone bad shit happens people

1230
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,139
die or disappear

1231
01:22:48,139 --> 01:22:53,119
I just mmm I could really use the help

1232
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:55,730
Clement I'm taking care of these kids

1233
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:59,060
it's not easy I'm worried that if I

1234
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,340
don't figure something out if I don't

1235
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,000
fix our food situation I can't lose

1236
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,369

1237
01:23:06,369 --> 01:23:09,579

going upriver to do some spearfishing

1253
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,520
hopefully I was to get along long enough

1254
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,640
to get some work done both teams could

1255
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:14,690
use some extra hands let's go do some

1256
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:20,300
hunting yeah take this I don't want you

1257
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,400
getting lost Thanks

1258
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,870
you need all hands on deck if we're

1259
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:25,840
gonna find like such a complicated area

1260
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,450
just remember to stay in the safe zone

1261
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,920
we need you to come back home in one of

1262
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,890
these so that means we'll get to stay

1263
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,330
what do you think I was gonna throw you

1264
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:36,380
out

1265
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:40,240
maybe as long as we got enough to eat

1266
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:48,080
both welcome here go get em AJ oh all

1267
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,370
right let's get going

1268
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:51,290
it'd be funny if AJ didn't know what a

1269
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:59,650
hi-fi was see here at

1270
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:01,850
this episode hasn't been going on for a

1271
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:03,860
while I was gonna go hunting as well I

1272
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,030
wonder what the differences if you

1273
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:15,740
choose hunting or fishing hunting

1274
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,650
grounds are usually clear of walkers

1275
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:19,580
sometimes they get caught in the snares

1276
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,590
and shit though you see a ribbon on a

1277
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:29,030
tree traps or nearby so watch where you

1278
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:32,480
step okay please I think I can handle

1279
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,290
myself

1280
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:37,160
I'm basically a ninja he's skilled in

1281
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,840
the craft of martial arts all right

1282
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,220
thanks for the heads for the warning

1283
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:47,690
careful around those okay okay yeah I

1284
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:50,570
know fun we got work to do

1285
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:52,370
not all of us have the privilege of

1286
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:56,030
being Marlins lap dog oh ouch someone's

1287
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,640
a little jealous and my defense I

1288
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,520
totally get things done I just prefer to

1289
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,050
think of survival is more of a

1290
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:07,760
day-to-day task so you know don't sweat

1291
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,660
the technique what about everyone else

1292
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,820
we need to work together as a team I

1293
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:18,050
mean sure yeah sometimes you act like

1294
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,790
you're the only one with a strategy I

1295
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:22,220
play the long game you got to have plans

1296
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,189
B C and D

1297
01:26:24,189 --> 01:26:26,739
and what if you don't make it that far

1298
01:26:26,739 --> 01:26:38,169
shut up a second what is that whoa what

1299
01:26:38,169 --> 01:26:43,800
is that what is that that was huge

1300
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,079
ah damn it I thought thought something

1301
01:26:47,079 --> 01:26:50,559
interesting what happened yeah I thought

1302
01:26:50,559 --> 01:26:52,150
it would be like a giant zombie or

1303
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:57,729
something like that would be so cool hey

1304
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:05,860
he's like a walker pinata okay down fix

1305
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:08,039
the snare and let's go oh well I will

1306
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:12,010
eventually if you want food for the kid

1307
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:14,110
I could use a hand or you can mess

1308
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:16,119
around with this idiot and starve man

1309
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:17,650

1392

1393
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:18,930
definitely don't have enough here you

1394
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:23,100
guys figure it out so what do we do eat

1395
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:26,460
rocks you can't eat rocks I'm aware so

1396
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,350
Marlon kick us out if we don't find food

1397
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,170
well let's not find out where else could

1398
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:35,100
we look let me think outside the red

1399
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:43,230
zone I think don't go here yeah it's not

1400
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:45,390
too far from here I don't know that's

1401
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:47,310
pretty far outside our perimeter there

1402
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,840
was food in there when AJ and I passed

1403
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,890
through it's worth a look sure there was

1404
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:55,230
food positive yep some of it was

1405
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,120
destroyed the explosion but there has to

1406
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,010
be something left there was so much

1407
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:06,680
there all right fine lead the way

1408
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,120
I'm sure the food is cooked as well you

1409
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,390
know multiband very good the cooked I

1410
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:21,970
cook with an grenade

1411
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:24,450
well this is probably not gonna go well

1412
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:27,960
walkers than last time now

1413
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:31,200
oh dude leafy it's how they die here or

1414
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,390
divert longer take your pick

1415
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:36,390
on maybe you should scope things out you

1416
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:39,180
know the place better let me get a

1417
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:40,110
closer look

1418
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:49,260
can't be too careful

1419
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,720
I climb up there I don't know how that

1420
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:56,280
would get us inside need to get in there

1421
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:01,080
somehow maybe there's another way in you

1422
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,420
barely got out of here it was close it

1423
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:09,300
sounds scary there's a reason it's like

1424
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,000
a really bad idea

1425
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,410
able to get the Walker's attention they

1426
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:16,070
do like to follow sound

1427
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:18,990
you look like you've got an idea the

1428
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:21,030
noise from that Bell could draw a lot of

1429
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:23,280
walkers if one of us climbs up there and

1430
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,160
starts ringing it Louis Ivo Louis this

1431
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,330
is way too Daniel

1432
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:30,350
I'd like to make an alternate suggestion

1433
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:34,020
you're loud dramatic a little annoying I

1434
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:41,940
think out all right I see how it is I'll

1435
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:44,550
go with you give you some cover okay

1436
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:46,770
this could mean just don't do it but I

1437
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:49,020
died I'm making sure Walker Lewis eats

1438
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:52,710
both of you first I'll distract them

1439
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:54,750
till I see you guys reach safer cover

1440
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,390
then I'll try to redirect the smelly

1441
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:59,340
Patrol to give you guys a chance to

1442
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,350
sprint inside the building when we get

1443
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:03,180
into position I'll signal you then you

1444
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:11,199
can do your thing good luck

1445
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,270
also if you have a place like this and

1446
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:14,710
they're attracted to noise couldn't you

1447
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:18,760
set up like traps at our sound base like

1448
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:22,989
if you're getting oh oh yeah I have to

1449

1492
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:06,830

1550
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:06,120
walkers you just let him take our food

1551

1556

took him outside the safe zone they saw

1561
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:47,429
someone you know what that means enough

1562
01:45:47,429 --> 01:45:50,350
just means there's a hungry guy out

1563
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,630
there looking for food it's happened

1564
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:57,880
before you are overreacting you can't be

1565
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,870

go enjoy you've earned it

1581
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,949
well he cooks fast this time I thought

1582
01:47:00,949 --> 01:47:05,900
that way ever since we lost Sophie and

1583
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,640
Minnie already has been freaked out by

1584
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,699
anything that happens past the safe zone

1585
01:47:09,699 --> 01:47:13,010
she'll be all right eventually still we

1586
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:14,390
should make sure this is a one-time

1587
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:16,160
thing we can take Rosie out in the

1588
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:18,080
morning see if she catches a scent you

1589
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,430
know just in case

1590
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:21,110
yeah why don't they huntin with the dog

1591
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:27,890
I'm gonna go clean up I think I'll go

1592
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:29,050
too

1593
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:34,030
see you later

1594
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,640
don't worry about them and they're just

1595
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:44,290
sad sad why my sister's died around this

1596
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:47,800
time last year I think it's starting to

1597
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,230
get to people doesn't it get to you

1598
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:58,420
not really dying's not scary I mean it's

1599
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:03,010
sad but not scared you've been in here

1600
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:06,310
too long when you see more death it'll

1601
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:09,370
be a lot more afraid of it or maybe a

1602
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:11,170
lot less that's a good point

1603
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:15,420
I try not to focus on them being gone I

1604
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,460
like picturing where they'd be now he

1605
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:23,530
said oh so awesome it means stuff she'd

1606
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:25,150
build a place big enough for all of us

1607
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:28,360
to live and paint it - and mini-b

1608
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,980
playing whatever new song she wrote

1609
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:34,480
that's me I guess that doesn't scare me

1610
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,580
because I know I have something waiting

1611
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,280
on the other side

1612
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:43,030
did you see guru you see that all of us

1613
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:46,120
together looks like a nice place to wind

1614
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:51,670
up yeah I think so too a lot better than

1615
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:54,940
some smelly old school

1616
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,710
you're the one that's mine you know that

1617
01:48:56,710 --> 01:48:59,860
right the walkers who killed them you

1618
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:03,070
want them all they weren't always

1619
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:06,700
walkers wherever this place is everyone

1620
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:07,990
gets to be a person again

1621
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:11,200
oh they drive the walkers the way they

1622
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:14,830
probably looked sometimes I draw Minnie

1623
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:17,350
and Sophie the way they probably left

1624
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:23,620
them but sometimes I draw this - can can

1625
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:24,280
I be there

1626
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:28,590
sure

1627
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:32,699
you want to be there to know nah-nah-nah

1628
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:34,980
date I promise I'll tell you well sure

1629
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:36,420

1630
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:45,139
oh my god can something happens please

running away but the ranch was nice too

1654

though him getting away with a little

1667
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,139

1691
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,770
happening that creepy sir I think I

1692
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:54,450
understand what the problem is with

1693
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:56,250
these Walking Dead and is that they

1694
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,770
constantly just introduce new characters

1695
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:02,310
all the time like all the time and we

1696
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:05,730
have to start from zero all the time the

1697
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:07,110
only character we care about is

1698
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:09,750
Clementine so really we know nothing's

1699
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:11,280
gonna happen about there there's no

1700
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,830
suspense there's no feeling of oh my god

1701
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:19,170
what's gonna happen they need to keep

1702
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:21,210
the characters going you know make you

1703
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:28,020
invested longer

1704
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:31,740
like one character two characters we

1705
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:34,440
only really have Clementine oh I didn't

1706
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:39,720
mean like yeah this is an interesting

1707
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,030
setting I know we will get better as

1708
01:54:42,030 --> 01:54:43,920
episodes go but it's annoying having to

1709
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,420
start from zero all the time I think

1710
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:49,500
someone's in trouble is it us no no no

1711

but we should help them if it's a

1713
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,840
monster we should kill it I don't think

1714
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:59,100
it is but we might still act like your

1715

these are all the things they remember

1944
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:35,850
[Music]

1946
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:40,420

1947
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:44,140

1948
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:49,420

1953
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:05,170
cooler like the whole concept of the

1954
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:07,390
school and how it changes seems like a

1955
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:09,220
good idea strange choice for the last

1956
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:11,440
season but we'll see where it takes us
