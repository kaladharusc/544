00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,520

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:17,709
advent calendar for retards

38
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,750
looks like we need to open lucky number

39
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,780
two which happens to be the I do not

40
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,349
like category I wonder what's inside oh

41
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,540
I could use a fucking lazy susan right

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:43,400
about now alright now gets the good part

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,409
the part that you guys going for this is

44
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,200
the unboxing part with any good unboxing

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,629
you gotta have a stationary camera so

46
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,790
this ain't gonna work oh boy I am so

47
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,400
excited shall lay down a tablecloth I

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,819
got no strings to hold me down to make

49
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:02,930
me sad

50
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,599
to make me frown nothing quite like a

51
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,400
good picnic ooh

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,620
welcome to the plan show population

53
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,109
scarce I got these off Amazon should be

54
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,790
good to eat they'll say edible I think

55
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,319
on them insects are difficult to eat

56
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,000
because they have a lot of moving parts

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,549
a cow it doesn't have very many moving

58
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,739
parts so this might be a challenge

59
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,959
we got orth of taro mix which includes

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,690
grasshoppers mole crickets big crickets

61
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,549
small crickets and salt thank goodness

62
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,079
they added the salt otherwise these

63
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,639
wouldn't taste very good I mean

64
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,109
obviously I'm not to eat the whole bag

65
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,389
going into this I was thinking I can

66
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,190
consume the whole bag because I'm quite

67
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,430
hungry but now I'm thinking a quarter of

68
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,040
the bag is probably unreasonable a man

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,349
walks into a bar and the bartender is a

70
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,780
north of Tara and he asked the ortho

71
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,939
para king can I get a drink and the

72
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:00,590
Orphic Tara responds we got four little

73
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,370
nodes here I know Allah I'm in the pussy

74
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,459
mindset right now I am a Taiwanese child

75
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,500
who knows nothing more

76
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,530
then the flavour of insects and I love

77
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,010
to eat boiled flavorless insects to the

78
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,440
eagle that means feed me those bugs

79

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,990
inside there oh to be honest the mound

83
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,790
looks exactly the same as the other one

84
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,780
okay okay okay okay okay okay

85
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,360
I just want to jump off the counter and

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,160

92
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,410

93
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,440
eat a little bit of each one or an

94
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,110
entirety of one of them I think that's

95
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,000
fair this thing's gonna be way hella

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
crunchy and I'm gonna have a hard time I

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,880
think I'm gonna have a hard time putting

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,919
it down because it'll be in chunks I'll

99
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,930
have to chew it for a long time what am

100
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,190

vegan after this I am a Vietnamese boy

128
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,539
who loves eating his Vietnamese cuisine

129
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,659
which includes insects it's a staple in

130
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:45,009
our diet and one of our delicacies is

131
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:52,530

135
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,669
as a young teen amis boy I would stop

136
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,919
never to show with my mouth open they

137
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,180
say if you want to lose weight you

138
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,800
should chew up your food a lot cause a

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,210
lot of money to get one of these things

140
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,770
okay you don't want to squander your

141
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,020
experience you want to know a sign of

142
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,360
someone who's about to vomit they owe

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,760
sign you know if there's a guy or a girl

144
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,850
at the party she's being a lot quieter

145
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,510
but then they normally are sums up all

146
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,320

150
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,750

153
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,770
for watching everyone this was a very

154
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,919
unpleasant episode in many ways but we

155
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,780
have so many more episodes to get

156
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,970
through you guys didn't see the part of

157
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,060
pattern boxing where I cleaned up all

158
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,780
the shit

159
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,760
cleaning up is like the moon it's so

160
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,710
it's such a pain in the neck today's

161
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,450
cleanup is slightly easier than it

162
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,169
normally would be

163
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,550
you just fucking grab the tablecloth and

164
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,400
you take this way

165
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,820
