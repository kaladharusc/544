1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,969
hi everyone welcome back to another

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,269
episode of bad unboxing fanmail on

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,800
today's episode we're going to keep

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,619
things really cool really chill we're

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,570
gonna open a lot of boxes that take us

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,210
closer to nature mother nature the

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,570
goddess of all the gods she's got two

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,580
tits made out of leaves and she's got

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,399
one pussy made out of a pinecone one of

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,170
the reasons that we're going back to our

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,020
roots in this episode is because we have

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,760
a couple of packages here that contain

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,790
wildlife I'm talking about ladybugs you

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,280
guys have sent ladybugs before I don't

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,780
know why you chose to send them again

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,030
three boxes of ladybugs addressed to

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,059
idubbbz TV aka daddy idubbbz TV I hope

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,039
you die of breast cancer idubbbz TV

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,890
niggy roof agamous I really like this

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,660
last one here because it reminds me that

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,670
we need to start using code words you

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,469
know we can just blatantly jump down and

23
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,120
say I'm gay anymore that's not really

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,460
appropriate we need to hide our speech

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,229
because the google deepmind learning

26
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,240
algorithm is eventually going to scan

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,820
the videos and instantly censor it I

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,240
need you guys to know that when I say

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
salte my dish bartender that actually

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:17,820
means

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,270
hey cunt bring your fat snatch over here

32
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,979
and wipe it on the floor wipe up the

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,799
puddle of seminal fluids cunt the

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,180
interesting thing about these is it

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,770
looks like they're all sent from a

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,869
different person you got the one guy who

37
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,380
was like oh yeah 150 seems like a lot of

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,930
ladybirds I would probably completely

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,299
ruin the ecosystem around here if I

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,189
release these well you guys know me I

41
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,590
like to be one with nature I'm gonna see

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,860
what they think of the place you know I

43
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,939
was thinking this would be a lot cooler

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,220
but they're really just kind of crawling

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,600
around it's kind of stupid

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
these things fucking suck they're laying

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,020
it all over me and it's gonna pester me

48
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,520
for the rest of the episode but I bet

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,649
you guys fucking like that this is a

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,950
package from Target money shot thank you

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,020

the mustache what mustache is gone hey

53
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,500

oh wow it's perfect shirt for me dude

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,280
someone made a custom book called

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,780

guys are aware we're not opening all

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,319
packages chronologically because some

60
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,840
people send ladybugs and they need to be

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,610
open first otherwise they'll die on it

62
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,050
that would be a big you know PETA issue

63
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,650
