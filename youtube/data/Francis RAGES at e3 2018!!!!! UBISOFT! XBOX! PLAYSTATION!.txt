34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,060
consuming companies you love and pooping

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,540
them out as mobile games or IP Dungeon

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,030
Keeper bugs off all let me under

37

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,850

40
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,860
I tried I tried to catch him but a

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,159
security guy said he was too busy to see

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,399
me

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,290
well Microsoft had some pretty good

44
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,899
games they bought up five new studio

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,000
still make games for them and then they

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,979
show off halo infinite that looks pretty

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,020
good and all these games are gonna come

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,659
out about four years after I'm dead so I

49
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,729
really look forward to my ghosts getting

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,989
to play the fucking things I don't know

51
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,069
why smoke me playing it here Microsoft

52
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,079
q thank you very much you just joined

53
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,999
Paulo's new video game show my fucking

54
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:16,810
grave

55
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,459
I just think about Microsoft you never

56
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:19,540
know where the games coming out

57
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,670
crackdown was supposed to be a launch

58
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,219
title okay and now we're five years out

59
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,379
okay no matter how much Terry Crews you

60
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,730
put it and if you never released you

61
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,290
ain't gonna be a good game

62
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,269
clora the Microsoft pressure was a lot

63
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,340
like watching boogies YouTube video he's

64
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,799
back in 2015 you know it can't make a

65
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,739
big promises but he stayed really fat

66
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:39,549
yeah

67
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:41,560
the yulie sauce pressure was a bit of a

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,959
shit show I mean nothing new there they

69
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,909
got their own version I see a things and

70
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:48,040
then they're in bed with Nintendo and I

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,019
think I think he's literally in bed with

72
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,239
Nintendo because Miyamoto was up there

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,099
and he had bad hair and everything I

74
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,590
think I think they're doing it to him

75
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,349
seriously a little toys to life game

76
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,049
they got nice you know amiibos and space

77
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,519
when I got them to let them put starfox

78
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,409
in there okay I don't know what you guys

79
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:10,810
are doing a mini motto this is something

80
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,819
shorter like hostage situation I will

81
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,069
pay the ransom please let him go so he

82
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,079
can make good games instead of your crap

83
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,970
I will tell you the feel this moment

84
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,519
though is after they showed Beyond Good

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,229
and Evil - Atta girl to this

86
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,720
presentation her her mic was still hot

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,259
and she said we nailed it we nailed it

88
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,250
oh he's so cute

89
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,139
I'll say something you want to call me

90
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,099
I'll nail you hey you were hot you know

91
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,449
a lot of people like to PlayStation

92
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,340
pressure and I think I was supposed to

93
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,930
like because they gave me this blue band

94
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,209
I'm gonna go to the party and everything

95
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,250
and I got a look at spider-man I gotta

96
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,250
play it I like spider-man a game was

97
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,049
pretty good I liked all the village they

98
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,540
showed but what was with this pressure

99
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,879
for like the first half hours just said

100
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,409
showing up there with a bunch of people

101
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,959
I don't even know and it was awkward and

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,359
it was weird and then there wasn't just

103
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,219
one musical introduction but there was

104
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,829
two musical introductions III the year

105
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,509
of people playing music that you don't

106
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,650
want to hear from instruments you've

107
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,969

108
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,250
