2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,469
it still takes 45 seconds for Pixar and

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,849
Disney logos to jerk each other off

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,860
this is agent Leland Java Pixar takes

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,389
the dock hollywood-style story of cars

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,310
and makes the sequel spy movie like its

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,109
King James Bond I'm sure on paper it

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,310
sounds really sweet but sometimes you

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,420
have to make an entire movie to figure

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,720
that out

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,310
this is Pixar so I'm sure these

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,600
coordinates are accurate for some place

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,400
in the Pacific Ocean but who cares the

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,480
latitude and longitude

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,560
I haven't had to care about that since I

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,060
aced my fifth grade geography class and

17
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,810
forgot all about it

18
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,160
okay fun he found a way to sneak over

19
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,329
the other ship when no one was looking

20
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,640
the problem is the ship he's hanging on

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
to with alive and probably has feeling

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,149
good so how does he hook onto another

23
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,829
sentient vehicles flesh without that guy

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,469
knowing then faces pop ova movie also

25
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,090
errors in spending way too many opening

26
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,170
minutes on characters we don't know

27
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,489
headlight based zoom in and enhance

28
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,469
cliche although we are living in the

29
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,760
world where the crates did unload

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,350
themselves we wouldn't ban it on even if

31
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,760
you could do this why would you do this

32
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,050
you had a perfect look into what this

33
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,460
operation was and got crystal-clear

34
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,410
audio the only reason you do this is so

35
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,059
you can get caught for movie purposes -

36
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,030
done double here folks - tons above see

37
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,530
why does this car fall to absolute

38
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,150
pieces upon hitting the water but the

39
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,710
pieces still maintain their basic body

40
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,180
shape if every car on this rig was

41
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,409
following him up the ramp that just

42
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,420
exploded then huh are there any cars up

43
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,740
here at the top ready to chase after it

44
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,270
about a minute ago we just saw a car

45
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,009
explode from the surface tension so how

46
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,990
does fin survive an even higher jump is

47
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,340
it because of his Greg Louganis style

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,960
form as he enters the water because I'm

49
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,159
pretty sure the surface tension does

50
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,479
give it about your four Olympic gold

51
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,369
medals here's a car operating a gun on

52
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,810
board a boat and again I raised my

53
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,040
concerns about how the screen vehicle

54
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,960
Society works why is a car accenting

55
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,460
enough to fire a boat gun but the boat

56
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,170
itself is not got all the cool spy

57
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,430
gadgets man that comes with the

58
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,140
territory in spy movies but if he could

59
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,340
do this why did he need to hitch a ride

60
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,630
on a boat could have gone completely

61
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,100
stealth mode underwater all the way up

62
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,930
to the rig who can stop us now

63
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,320
major tow major that - That moment when

64
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,759
you realize mater is the sequel's main

65
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,350
character instead of lightning I thought

66
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,240
I could make it this time kind of cars

67
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,380
that break down in the middle of the

68
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,060
desert call for help advantage humans

69
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,590
assholes because when our cars break

70
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,850
down we still have legs and sometimes

71
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,490
phones this is your tan tone as much so

72
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,590
that means it's on the house what kind

73
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,360
of ass face tow company has a rewards

74
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,680
policy we're your tenth tow in a month

75
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,300
is free literally no one in the entire

76
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,099
US gets towed ten times a month except

77
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,660
characters written by screenwriter later

78
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,690
is a dick

79
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,700
the Queen back yet will be literally

80
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,470
imitates conversations between children

81
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,700
and their parents almost nine minutes

82
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,370
into this car sequel crazy excited about

83
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,130
20th for a festive cup expositional

84
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,190
towing mater is as excited as a puppy to

85
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,810
see McQueen to the point he's about to

86
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,420
kill the guy you do it is so good to see

87
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,670
you buddy speak for yourselves

88
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,340
I can't believe I renamed a piston cup

89
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,620
after our very own dog guts

90
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,420
how is this new doesn't everybody watch

91
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,100
the piston cup certainly this town would

92
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,690
follow lightning and get word that they

93
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,160
renamed the cup and Doc's honor since

94
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,930
he's from here but then appalled Neumann

95
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,460
died a couple years after cars but how

96
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,140
did his character die mother I was in

97
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,650
tip-top shape

98
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,240
this asshole Otis can keep driving

99
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,560
around and breaking down on the side of

100
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,790
the road really doc could do better than

101
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,230
that feel like they could say move to

102
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,580
some faraway Island to get the same

103
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:57,940
effect

104
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,500
hey we find out this is some dickhead

105
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,240
playing a practical joke but that means

106
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,410
this asshole has been sitting here in

107
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,850
the tunnel on the off chance cars are

108
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,500
driving down the tracks tireless mater

109
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,490
enlightening film a recruiting

110
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,960
commercial for the Prometheus school of

111
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,340
running away from things it's kinda

112
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,960
offshoot of count tipping raises more

113
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,640
questions than answers like why is a

114
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,020
sentient vehicle out in the pasture

115
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,520
sleeping like an animal also what the

116
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,410
machine this big doing out this bump

117
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,480
tiny ass counselor noting the incredible

118
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,890
Beals is probably ten times better than

119
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,750
this movie NATO is officially the cable

120
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,860
guide level of creepy

121
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,480
showing up to lightning and Sally's date

122
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,980
as a waiter and yes I know he's being

123
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,540
played by Larry the Cable Guy but I met

124
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,800
the Jim Carrey character pun not

125
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,840
intended to show the world what is new

126
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,940
super fuel can do he's created a racing

127
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,160
competition like no other and but why

128
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,600
not just scientifically demonstrate your

129
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,580
fuels benefits on our YouTube video you

130
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,510
definitely don't need a host of car

131
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,040
breaks and how all these competitors be

132
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,330
able to run on your new fuel without

133
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,010
having advanced time to test it and see

134
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,940
how their engine reacts

135
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,280
you're bringing mater right you never

136
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,050
bring them to any of your races that's

137
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,610
racist let me see if I have this right

138
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,050
lightning is chillin on vacation at all

139
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,030
but some open-wheel race bitch brags on

140
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,739
lightning and mater just happens to be

141
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,330
watching so he calls in to challenge

142
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,890
that ragging do lightning comes to see

143
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,300
what the fuss is about sees his friend

144
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,890
getting dissed on TV and then agrees to

145
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,840
a road course race challenge out of pure

146
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,640
defensive mater and no concept of the

147
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,050
race itself and that's how this movie

148
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,260
kicked its main plot into gear I mean

149
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,199
not using a car song for this montage is

150
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,949
a little too on-the-nose

151
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,199
the cars rule the cars movies do not

152
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,820
let's not confuse the two for younger

153
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,380
generations also this is a relationship

154
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,180
song more likely a breakup song where

155
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,590
the singer says all I want is you to a

156
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,330
girl or boy he's in love with but this

157
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,889
is a travel montage making the song

158
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,449
choice even more confusing oh and by the

159
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,710
way the same band has a song called

160
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,050
drive FYI see I'm just being a dick to

161
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,790
cartoons giving me funny details when I

162
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,740
want to travel montage but was made her

163
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,330
meet with a travel pillow everyone on

164
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,560
this plane is asleep except lightning

165
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,000
and mater and they're awake because

166
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,470
they're watching Japanese Ninja Warrior

167
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,930
for cars I guess this movie is soaking

168
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,729
offensively terrible Jesus lightning

169
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,380
McQueen is on a giant billboard here but

170
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,820
no one recognizes and driving the common

171
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,740
streets among the normals fact here's

172
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,090
Lightning McQueen and a store dedicated

173
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,979
the merchandise about him yet he is

174
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,320
still on Mob check out that tow truck

175
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,440
man I wonder who that guys with cars to

176
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,729
is seriously about to try and ring

177
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,110
emotional conflict out of lightning

178
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,490
being embarrassed by mater's higness

179
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,320
which not only the first movie cover but

180
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,910
is also a bit of a cliche storyline

181
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,400
anyway Jeannie and I get vigilant yeah

182
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,810
either suddenly wants to be friends with

183
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,250
the asshole you just yelled at on

184
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,020
national TV for the disrespect towards

185
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,610
his best friend is this his character I

186
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,500
think is annoying is he is this is not

187
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,150
something he would do hey look it's that

188
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,710
spy car from the opening about whom I

189
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,240
remember nothing taking on the biggest

190
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,490
oil reserve in the world how did we miss

191
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:27,789
that

192
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,080
they've been scrambling everyone

193
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,680
satellite all-american is here tonight

194
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,599
to pass it to you why would some

195
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,250
important spot be happening here in the

196
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,930
preamble to the big race why isn't this

197
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,220
exchange happening somewhere that

198
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,360
secluded is it so there will be a

199
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,590
hilarious mixup with mater where he

200
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,820
becomes relevant to the story

201
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,410
hugs down there were on the oil platform

202
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,450
if they see me the whole mission is

203
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,220
compromised in it even further reason

204
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,750
why no top secret exchanges would be

205
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,220
happening in public places like this ah

206
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,910
he's a little excited soon a joke how

207
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,770
Shrek uh via Pixar sequel straight from

208
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,330
a wasabi misunderstanding joke into a

209
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,919
pee joke I refused to believe Hong

210
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,539
Kong's bathroom door symbols for gender

211
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,830
or this vague this is just more

212
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,510
manufactured confusion to create mater

213
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,370
hilariousness this movie seriously aired

214
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,330
on what it thought people might have

215
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,889
enjoyed about the first one like super

216
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,560
hard air

217
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm could he possibly have seen that

218
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,100
would lead to this reaction everyone is

219
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,480
driving around this place naked and

220
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,980
again left wondering why a car thus

221
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,720
guides needs to get out of disguise for

222
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,130
any reason ever especially for something

223
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,610
like this

224
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,900
mater is oblivious to this battle

225
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,850
because he's the been sidetracked by

226
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,680
this first but but the day experienced

227
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,880
whatever you do I would not go in there

228
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,470
mater takes a second to pay homage days

229
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,700
spent or prepare to meet work this is

230
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,930
the exact same thing that happened to me

231
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,610
the last time I visited a porn set a

232
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,040
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator

233
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,020
well of course it does that goes it's

234
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,540
Erica yep the spies came up with pass

235
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,980
phrases that are easily answered by

236
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,720
anyone with knowledge of cars it's fine

237
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,280
somewhere more private well yeah I know

238
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,530
cars to make spine look even harder than

239
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,750
it already is why do you have HD video

240
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,430
surveillance of basically everywhere but

241
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,020
no audio which would tell you that mater

242
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,250
is not the second agent you have

243
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,260
mistaken important also I saw the man

244
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,610
who knew too little and I'm looking down

245
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,050
at you for basically doing a car based

246
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,120
ripoff of that movie all along making

247
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,860
its debut tonight is the required fuel

248
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,270
again and I do think this is worth

249
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,280
sitting twice how do you force cars to

250
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,900
race on your new fuel without giving

251
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,430
them time beforehand to test it out so

252
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,229
now the two most drummed up participants

253
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,120
in this race Lightning and Francesco are

254
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,620
both starting the race in the very last

255
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,240
two spot for the back of the pack why

256
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
they so favorite if they pulled so

257
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,180
poorly is to be last at the starting

258
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,190
line now the is there a camera in front

259
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,750
of lighten queen that is faster than him

260
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,490
in order to record this why is he in the

261
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,060
pit

262
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,190
he's so exposed it's amazing to me that

263
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,690
these spies were just seen hanging up in

264
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,490
public suddenly good about where other

265
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,780
spies are hanging out under this analogy

266
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,440
is stupid

267
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,750
I want a roll bar an inanimate object be

268
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,070
excited about the prospect of being

269
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,330
repeatedly put to the test

270
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,740
even when protecting a human a roll bar

271
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,150
is going to suffer during a car crash

272
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,760
right pain imp scratches mostly I just

273
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,320
think this is a super lazy car based

274
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,820
analogy and I wanted to call it out the

275
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,620
M keys work on electronic devices and

276
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,060
equipment this movie will suggest the

277
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,620
gasoline in these cars somehow reacts

278
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,780
negatively to the EMP as though there is

279
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,120
electronics inside the gasoline when

280
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,290
really an EMP would stop a car

281
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,729
regardless of fuel because modern cars

282
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,229
are all electronically controlled so

283
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,000
this fuel additive of death is just

284
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,530
pointless and stupid looks like this

285
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,380
entire sequel ya got now I usually like

286
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,330
to have a proper detailing then or I

287
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,410
mean a lady friend

288
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,300
somehow mater is coaxed into getting out

289
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,740
of the pits just because this beautiful

290
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,090
lady car begs him to do it

291
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,470
and yeah the power of car boners is

292
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,970
probably strong but enough to get made

293
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,560
her away from his best friend's race but

294
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,570
he's leading and it's almost over but I

295
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,130
know that Finn is a high priority target

296
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,330
for the bad guys but they are

297
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,800
specifically looking for mater right now

298
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,029
he's the one with the thing that they

299
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,740
need so why is the entire bad guy grew

300
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,419
going after Finn Tom leaned ahead toward

301
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,320
a truck mater who's been thinking with

302
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,940
his car dick this entire time decides

303
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,589
not to follow shift Wells instructions

304
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,930
in this instance a Bharati damaged I

305
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,190
mean your stupidity is kind of a

306
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,660
liability for this movie it works in

307
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,100
small doses but this is cringe-worthy

308
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,380
and generally insulting I lost the race

309
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,390
because of you we're supposed to believe

310
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,710
that lightning learned his lesson from

311
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,060
the first movie so well that he's

312
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,589
repeated this piston cup champion four

313
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,360
times but he's just as dickish in this

314
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,740
movie as he wasn't the last one it was

315
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,420
barely redeemable in the first cars now

316
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,180
he's maybe worse don't need your help

317
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,880
I don't want your help movie rips off

318
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,350
the telling off of Encino man from

319
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,029
Encino man which basically ripped off

320
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,260
the shooting of Old Yeller from Old

321
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeller which basically ripped off the

322
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,230
Abraham Isaac story from the Bible which

323
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,750
basically Ben Mac Messiah British

324
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,870
intelligence khomeini averaging telling

325
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,790
Mater grisly overstates his intelligence

326
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,860
also a mayor mistakenly believes British

327
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,360
folk in general had a high intelligence

328
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,430
though in his defense this was a decade

329
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,930
or more before the brexit vote do you

330
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,980
mean FBI CIA right yes Jay I'm trayful a

331
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,560
affiliate seriously mater were even a

332
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,940
tiny bit knocked on this movie could

333
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,740
exist though in his defense the British

334
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,209
intelligence agents in this movie are

335
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,650
basically just as much to blame since

336
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,880
they actually think mater is a secret

337
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,589
agent most of the film know some crud

338
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,290
hey I don't want to brag or nut

339
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,470
I got me a black fan today

340
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,840
he's pursuing cars grunt instead of you

341
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,950
know jumping out the window and

342
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,750
following these assholes like captain

343
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,520
winter soldier on the rooftop Oh a joke

344
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,530
guess I'm thin oh well when Pixar

345
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,240
resorts to go so you know something went

346
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,860
wrong this plane takes off despite a

347
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,330
flat rear tire and while I'm guessing

348
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,680
that may be possible in real life this

349
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,420
movie showed me the plane veering wildly

350
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,070
to the side after the tire blew so how

351
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,510
did the pilot hold it steady after that

352
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,160
to actually take off and how they gonna

353
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,710
land I didn't really wanted to leave yes

354
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,930
you did end of sit good agent gets what

355
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,550
he can and get that before he's killed

356
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,140
sorry why didn't the secret agent write

357
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,670
down some extra details if you could

358
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,950
only take one picture good neighbor

359
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,060
mater is how much did State Farm pay for

360
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,830
this on the one hand it's their jingle

361
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,270
and forever tied to them on the other

362
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,650
hand you actually saying mater instead

363
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,300
of State Farm my point is State Farm

364
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,560
might actually have tried to stop this

365
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,150
mention as opposed to sponsoring it

366
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,380
since it doesn't exactly make them look

367
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,360
good or back exactly men much help

368
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,790
anybody recently you're helping me

369
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,770
please my time this movie is a

370
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,910
long-awaited collaboration between

371
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,710
Michael Caine and Larry the Cable Guy

372
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,570
I guess plans are pigeons now sort of

373
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,590
lost track of what's supposed to be

374
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,210
intelligent lions and mere livestock in

375
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,230
this movie I can't get back to them BC

376
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,210
so this guy have binocular vision one

377
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,590
involved in this plot is one of

378
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,540
history's biggest loser cause that's

379
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,000
carsick secretly thing in two days

380
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
where's this meeting taking place portal

381
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,870
Gaza he thought he that's where the

382
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,850
Knights race yes and he I wonder what

383
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,110
car absolutely needs to be in the

384
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,910
location of every race and we've seen

385
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,070
his dubious backstory and is trying to

386
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,410
sell all and all could it be Axelrod can

387
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,380
survive April really I come by each one

388
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,420
of with my best friend Lightning McQueen

389
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,610
holy this movie just became the most

390
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,680
strictly bull imaginable you don't pop

391
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,120
out the dents caused by your time with

392
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
Lightning McQueen are we sure this

393
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,550
movie's plot was propelled by mater's

394
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,050
attraction to a female car because it

395
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,160
sounds like mater's more in love with

396
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,080
McQueen also I think the alternate more

397
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,580
believable plot to this movie would be

398
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,830
called e to major tambien Jean isn't

399
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,320
just posit you'll cover friendships can

400
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,810
be dangerous in our line of

401
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,460
me too my cocaine cuts her off before

402
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,900
made her as a chance to ask what she

403
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,870
means by cover honestly how many car

404
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,700
races does the Pope even go to I like

405
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,810
how every now and then the film cuts

406
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,100
back to lightening letting us believe

407
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,540
he's still a main character even though

408
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,330
he clearly is not God number of every

409
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,710
single joke in this movie is some sort

410
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,150
of car related replacement for whatever

411
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,890
humans use in this world stop not a

412
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,800
fractured nose stop measuring up on this

413
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,210
entire world has already explained or

414
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,280
implied that men and women cars get busy

415
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,630
and have children unless this now

416
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,460
implies that they go so do couples who

417
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,080
want children need them to be built and

418
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,610
if so is there some sort of pricing

419
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,990
where couples would want gremlins and

420
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,400
Pacers because they're the cheapest

421
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,470
children to buy and working on it

422
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,030
they're working on what in fact that a

423
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,680
heavily favored car just wrecked can you

424
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,730
not actually see through those things

425
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,430
were meant to be alternative fuels great

426
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,430
this moment after today everyone will

427
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,250
race back again early let's talk about

428
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,750
the villains plan fill in definitely

429
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,670
being Axelrod so his whole plan is to

430
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,810
make an alternative fuel that would

431
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,940
replace gasoline but create a flaw by

432
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,530
widgets fails publicly so that everyone

433
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,940
will go back to gasoline of which he

434
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,280
owns a lot but why do this if everyone

435
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,720
was already using gasoline wouldn't they

436
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,430
buy your oil anyway or are there many

437
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,720
different kinds of alternative fuel out

438
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,220
there besides all in all and he's hoping

439
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,600
that its failure will be a black eye for

440
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,610
alternative fuels but it doesn't make

441
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,140
sense either the other fuels aren't

442
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,880
exploded then did not see and more

443
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,140
importantly did not hear a helicopter

444
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,180
anywhere near the area before trying to

445
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,830
jump over can you choose your fuel for

446
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,570
the final race do you have any idea what

447
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,850
it's going to be all in all well that's

448
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,920
just looking stupid what we know what's

449
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,480
going on here but they don't all they

450
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,800
know is the cars are exploding for a

451
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
reason that could only be all these

452
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,460
assholes all pull guns on mater then

453
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,240
give him time to meet her tying shoes

454
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,470
mater is just going to keep accidentally

455
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,030
himself through this entire movie and

456
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,200
it's like I'm supposed to be all happy

457
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,970
because he's wearing up backpack shit

458
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,620
you'll kill without the other good days

459
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,330
okay so we're supposed to believe that

460
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,290
before lightning could get through the

461
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,910
crowd the bad guys grabbed mater and

462
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,080
replaced him with this evil look like

463
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,970
God and if that were the case then some

464
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,380
of these folks near him would have seen

465
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,690
that and would speak up this one here on

466
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,370
the right as a goddamn camera the bad

467
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,870
guys gasp mater instead of killing him

468
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,640
because they to have a great stake in

469
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,930
the toy line cars inspires

470
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,330
way too much of the gas induce mater

471
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,160
hallucination this is summon Idol right

472
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,590
here tying a man to a wait a second did

473
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,060
cars get up here to even tie him into

474
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,980
place so movie gives me a rage boner and

475
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,490
I'm gonna

476
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,970
or London NATO inside big Bentley

477
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,040
big Bentley glamour shot a big Bentley

478
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,990
say why did the point car Society build

479
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,490
all the things we have here in a real

480
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,420
human society okay do you moving when

481
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,800
mater awoke from his gasps nightmare

482
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,450
these two were this close to being

483
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,550
smashed by the next gear change but now

484
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,810
you want the gears to move and end up

485
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,190
with them even further away than where

486
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,810
they started this is computer animation

487
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,490
curse you don't actually have to accept

488
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,410
continuity errors you created them and

489
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,760
have the power to fix them these

490
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,170
motherfuckers move another slot closer

491
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,970
and yet still are a full slot away from

492
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,320
being crushed listen this movie is

493
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,910
terrible pretty much every way but the

494
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,649
single most terrible aspect is this gear

495
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,510
moving free without question makes me

496
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,220
want to kill we shouldn't be saying this

497
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,620
at all but I hope you win today movie

498
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,089
thinks that if it makes X over I'd say

499
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,260
this we won't believe he's not the bad

500
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,790
guy and I'm telling you right now you've

501
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,320
had no chance in hell though the key NP

502
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,520
he suddenly doesn't work because God

503
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,529
hates all of us and yes I know what the

504
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,820
movie tells us about McQueen's fuel

505
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,560
later that totally explains this I just

506
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,390
don't care he previously tested and

507
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,279
working laser ray to put cars running on

508
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,779
all in all doesn't work as expected so

509
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,670
they call in Plan B which is super

510
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,680
sudden and also a bomb planted in

511
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,540
McQueen's pit which is a way better

512
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,829
method of killing him than some kind of

513
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:13,700
laser ray anyway did you know she had

514
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,649
twin batteries and a front tires cuz I

515
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,750
definitely did not know that you may not

516
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,180
found on you they somehow knew that

517
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,440
mater would be able to get out of these

518
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,149
ropes by activating his machine guns

519
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,670
don't play so did not why not have a

520
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,649
bomb in the pit and a bomb on mater that

521
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:29,870
truck here's brat but I tell you what

522
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,060
yes you do know who that tow truck is

523
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,290
because he was seen with McQueen

524
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,790
everywhere before the first race and

525
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,170
he's the reason why McQueen is racing in

526
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,370
the first place because he called into

527
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,020
that show I mean to tell me there wasn't

528
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,399
a story about that and numerous pictures

529
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,260
of McQueen's best friend also mater a

530
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,520
tow truck is out running Lightning

531
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,459
McQueen who is lightning I'm back yes

532
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,149
mater

533
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,399
you are the bomb entire movie is built

534
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,450
around repeated asinine

535
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,829
misunderstandings and that makes me want

536
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,240
to kill something in anger like a plant

537
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,100
or a beetle nothing cute and lovable

538
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,020
obviously but still angry enough to

539
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,560
quell will be a sadly overestimating my

540
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,209
love of mater and McQueen in this series

541
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,060
of close calls

542
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,830
[Music]

543
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,630
movie speaks for the audience and does

544
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,550
so expertly even more of this what do we

545
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,399
do is a deceive oh you'll blow up

546
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,750
there's lightning blowing up skill

547
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,160
somehow work for the bad guys at this

548
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,360
point I wouldn't no one know what

549
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,680
happened how does this get blamed on all

550
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,050
Tommen powerful and rich beyond your

551
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,120
wildest dreams ain't going to make you

552
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,730
feel but citation needed yes that's just

553
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,440
ordinary water somehow knocking the bad

554
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,600
guys 100 feet back yeah it's coming from

555
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,070
a fire truck it's probably strong but

556
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,390
we're talking about the cars that we had

557
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,490
ton meter fuu-chan what sleek and all in

558
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,560
to party in Japan you'd keep in mind the

559
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,760
spawn had three minutes to go just

560
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,170
before they kick the bad guys asses

561
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,910
I know it's cartoon and this is what spy

562
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,890
movies do but it's still infuriating why

563
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,329
not just give him extra time so that all

564
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:50,529
the stuff they do in three minutes

565
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:53,019
doesn't seem impossible he created all

566
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,880
in all yeah but what if he found out who

567
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,709
y'all feel against the world was trying

568
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,930
to find sir ma'am what this brings us to

569
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,399
the flip side of the plan if all in all

570
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,050
is such a good product why can't he get

571
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,610
rich selling that clearly he can sell on

572
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,199
all and nobody gives a fit it's actually

573
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,209
gasoline in disguise like he's worried

574
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,350
that if he sold all and all for real

575
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,480
he'd be discovered as a fraud but isn't

576
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,220
he risking that very thing right now is

577
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,169
nobody testing this people face crazy

578
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:20,949
cheap are you idiot right bomb

579
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:22,120
deactivated

580
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,860
why would you make it so that this bomb

581
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,480
could be deactivated using only your

582
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,309
voice if you think there's a scenario by

583
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,510
which you would need to deactivate the

584
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,130
bomb which is unlikely why wouldn't you

585
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,510
think of how it incriminate you it's

586
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,120
official you're coming to all my races

587
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,919
from now on gee you're such a great guy

588
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,140
McQueen I can't wait for cars three nine

589
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,610
where you're probably a dick again for

590
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,230
someone known reason later cooking with

591
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,760
stoic British guards is everything I

592
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,740
hope this movie wouldn't be I made the

593
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,960
girlfriend oh you Arnold vestigation

594
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
prude that all in all was actually

595
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,710
gasoline okay so maybe this explains all

596
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,390
the bull about the plant as a new

597
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,770
product get introduced like this without

598
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,059
people finding out it's gasoline in the

599
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,710
first place plan is still stupid despite

600
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,900
this revelation to sell gas man still

601
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,130
doesn't explain how all in all would be

602
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,750
the end of all alternative fuels forever

603
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,429
either people would just blame all along

604
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,620
not the entire industry right why did it

605
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,970
take me so long to realize this movies

606
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,800
Francesco is just a discount John Jerome
