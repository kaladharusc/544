1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,889
Disney logo alone now takes up 33

2
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,480
seconds of screen time followed by a

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,759
retro Disney logo that itself takes 16

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,400
seconds even the beginning narration

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,560
there was only oh shit

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,730
pretty sure at no time in Earth's

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,800
history was it only ocean science is

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,119
giving this movie the finger and I'm

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,220
right there with it some began to seek

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,550
defeat these odds voyage across the vast

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,700
ocean to take it how was he able to find

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,410
it was Maui just flying around until he

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,300
happened upon it and even if he did just

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,489
happen upon it did he assume since this

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,260
island vaguely looks like a woman on her

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,670
side in the fetal position that he was

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,870
in the right place and that assumption

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,270
was correct

19
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,559
not only does Maui have shape-shifting

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,760
abilities he has the ability to

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,410
transport whatever object he's holding

22
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,850
to the appropriate appendage of whatever

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,739
animal he shifts to he didn't have this

24
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:53,910
power he would have to store the heart

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,559
between his toes before transitioning to

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,000
a hawk so it would be in his hock

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,180
talents Maui tried to escape but was

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,579
confronted by another who sought the

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,330
heart what can I say its exposition

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,619
until every one of us is devoured by the

31
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,740
bloodthirsty jaws of death and that's

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,299
how grandma got fired as the daycare

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,000
teacher well as we stay on our very safe

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,610
Island won't be fine Moana recycles the

35
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,229
overprotective dad character arc from

36
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,610
Finding Nemo and thinks I won't notice

37
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,430
what soon ooh he is paradise who would

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,299
want to go anywhere else while the king

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,950
of this island debates isolationism with

40
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,360
his mother his diaper wearing toddler

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,009
was about to drown look sea turtles are

42
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,329
given one shot they either make it to

43
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,680
the water or they don't I'm not sure

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,509
that overly assisting this one baby is

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,950
actually helping anyone since he is weak

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,570
and will likely be killed at sea early

47
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,530
on if I were making this movie this is

48
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,000
where a dickhead Barracuda would show up

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,619
and eat that idiot turtle baby you

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,970
couldn't even reach the sea without help

51
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,649
from a human toddler thankfully for the

52
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,479
turtle I did not rate this movie here is

53
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,920
where the movie takes a very Moses like

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,630
turn although in this case instead of

55
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,219
God being behind the phenomenon it's

56
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,159
ocean god I think maybe it's honestly

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,420
not clear who's doing this or why

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,129
actually as the ocean gives her a new

59
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,599
hairstyle I'm left to wonder how wrong

60
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,920
everything I'm seeing would be if it

61
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,580
were another Hugh

62
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,770
doing it instead of the ocean hey you I

63
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,600
move on Oh what are you doing you scared

64
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,850
me she scared you you're the one who let

65
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,230
her wander out into the ocean and stay

66
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,400
there long enough to drown you big

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,670
asshole walk away man

68
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,810
Disney sure does love to age up

69
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,100
characters through song don't think

70
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,900
here's the bad influence grandma and

71
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,610
just like any movie before it you can

72
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,230
bet that she's more right than anyone in

73
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,610
this film who is not a bad influence

74
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,800
grandma you are the future of our people

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Moana as much convention as this movie

76
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,400
box it's still another Disney movie

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,810
about a princess who doesn't want what

78
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,310
her destiny holds god damn how many

79
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,900
years is grandma Tala been dancing on

80
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,340
this beach she was out there for the

81
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,320
entire growing up montage baby the rock

82
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,030
Chippendale dancer kid here is super

83
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,590
inappropriate and suggests this Islands

84
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,910
males begin thinking about sex and

85
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,440
procreation at age eight have you ever

86
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,850
tried to crack a coconut I don't care

87
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,990
how rotten those things are they are

88
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,610
hardest there's no way this woman could

89
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,730
just pull this thing apart how traps in

90
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,560
the East Lagoon they're bullying up

91
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,440
listen this fish I'm sure we could we

92
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,870
fished beyond the reef no one goes

93
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,120
beyond the reef despite all science that

94
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,620
this land is dying mallanna's father

95
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,120
continues to refuse the ocean as an

96
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
option probably because of that whoever

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,030
that died that one time during that

98
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,410
flashback we've yet to see but still

99
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,290
it's stupid he took a canoe Maura is

100
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,700
here's the flashback I was talking about

101
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,200
we were in someone close to the chief

102
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
died and he got deathly afraid of ever

103
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,890
losing anyone again remind me again how

104
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,540
this is different from Finding Nemo his

105
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,080
best friend begged to be on that boat

106
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,209
your dad couldn't save him and therefore

107
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,430
all the ocean is evil makes sense also

108
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,930
this seems to be a pretty small village

109
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,190
if she knows everyone on the island

110
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,720
surely she knows the drowned man's

111
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,459
grieving family and should also have

112
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,770
heard this story many times before

113
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,210
and right here I'm going to praise the

114
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,680
film for a powerful song while also

115
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,270
shaming the film for having a current

116
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,800
pop singer cover this awesome song in

117
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,150
the credits I'd be giving us in back

118
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,010
here were it not for the doubly sinful

119
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,870
pop cover in the credits so sadly I'm

120
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,220
left to sit in this moment it's normal

121
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,750
because the movie is an idiot most

122
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,610
convenient guys are timing ever this

123
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,110
movie false starts the heroine see

124
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,430
adventure we all know is going to happen

125
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,560
anyway but we get several near misses

126
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,570
before she finally gets there Jesus it's

127
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,090
my wedding night all over again you had

128
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,800
a loose pig on a bamboo raft headed

129
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,120
toward waves what did you think was

130
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,680
gonna happen lady because of the stupid

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,940
pig Mohan is gonna get trapped

132
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,350
underwater by the screenplay which

133
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,580
desperately wants to give the father's

134
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,960
never leave the island arguments some

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,490
kind of reasoning or weight or I could

136
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,930
have just gone with inconvenient Coral

137
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,590
is convenient I don't even know why I

138
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,240
pool got on the boat to begin with pigs

139
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,070
hate water that's when I die I'm going

140
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,980
to come back as one of these literally

141
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,500
you've been told all out people's

142
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,070
stories but what the one about us being

143
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,510
boat people that either your father

144
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,040
entirely forgot about or refused to tell

145
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,390
you all because he had a buddy died in

146
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,820
the ocean one time what's in there the

147
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,640
answer to the question you keep asking

148
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,520
yourself also boats look if you want to

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,900
erase your people's voting history and

150
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,250
become island dwellers afraid of the

151
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,050
water how hard is it to just dispose of

152
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,450
the old boats bamboo and fabric just

153
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,550
light a fire boom no more evidence for

154
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,260
precocious daughters to find case closed

155
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,610
these boats have been in here for a

156
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,080
thousand years and even though they've

157
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,550
been behind a waterfall this whole time

158
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,140
they're in perfect condition bang the

159
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,150
truth grandma did say bang the drum but

160
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,919
despite the two sticks on top this looks

161
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,480
nothing like a drum grandma should have

162
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,160
been more specific said bang the upside

163
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,900
down all wood horsey saddle lookin Fang

164
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,820
also at the risk of sounding cynical an

165
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,350
anti ghost music how the fuck does

166
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,150
playing these old ass moisture log drums

167
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,620
wake up the fire ghosts and give her

168
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,190
literal visions of her ancestors

169
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,150
[Music]

170
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,000
[Applause]

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,560
so basically this cave was an ancestral

172
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,970
YouTube video waiting for someone to

173
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,530
enter the cave banging the drums and

174
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,819
then all would be revealed do I have

175
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,139
that right because that is way more

176
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,520
ridiculous than I remember it being when

177
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,870
I saw this movie in the theater this

178
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,610
movie does flirt with the mystical given

179
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,229
the glow a manta ray grandma on that

180
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,060
whole island as a person ending but

181
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,099
still this cave seems like the easy cave

182
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:00,470
of plot driving information hi the ocean

183
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,199
chose you well if the ocean is the smart

184
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,550
and omnipotent how did it ever get

185
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,379
consumed and defeated by defeated ending

186
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,330
and why does it need granny's help also

187
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,039
why doesn't the ocean just grab Moana

188
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,330
and send her straight to Maui without a

189
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,360
boat burn those boats a long time ago I

190
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,159
mean what you're the sea hating-ass

191
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,930
motherfucker on the island and you knew

192
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,370
about the cave ancestor boats and you

193
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,110
let them be were you waiting for someone

194
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,789
to find them why didn't you burn them a

195
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,819
long time ago it's your father

196
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,110
thankfully the chief is stopped from

197
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,580
burning the canoes by his mother's heart

198
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,530
attack wait one person who should be

199
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,759
dead already finds the strength to

200
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,349
expose it all over the hero with a word

201
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,780
bath of instructions cliche carries no

202
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,960
way you could go that I wanna be with

203
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,030
you hey am I the only one that remembers

204
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,800
a few minutes ago when this diagram I

205
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,610
could barely speak

206
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,319
now she's an expositional fountain the

207
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,699
mom who barely qualifies for her

208
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,110
character in this movie decides to help

209
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,310
send her off even though I have no

210
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,599
reason to believe that she has any clue

211
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,610
why Milano is leaving Oh does she know

212
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,990
how to sail this thing movie doubles

213
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,219
down on non-existent Fisher

214
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:59,360
constellation alan tudyk voicing an

215
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,620
idiot chicken is the best thing about

216
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,360
this movie and would also be the best

217
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,279
thing about literally any movie once and

218
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,789
on Nextup mouth if your only indication

219
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,020
of where to go or the star is shaped

220
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,940
like a hook in the sky then how she's

221
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,469
supposed to navigate during the day keep

222
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,699
in mind mallanna has never sailed a boat

223
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,650
in her life maybe don't go sailing until

224
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,300
you actually have sailing skills just a

225
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,860
thought the storm went from on the

226
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,479
horizon to on top of her in about three

227
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,900
seconds

228
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,770
Looby tries to make you think the

229
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,120
character the film is named after just

230
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,710
died but movie is pretty delusional on

231
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,759
that point if you ask me

232
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,530
dear movie showing us the chicken first

233
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,060
kills all the suspense that mallanna

234
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,050
might not have lived through the

235
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,300
mallanna is untouchable got it thanks

236
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,710
for the chicken jokes thankfully the

237
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,569
ocean storm deposited her at exactly the

238
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:39,949
place she was hoping to find what are

239
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,659
the odds never mind don't tell me the

240
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:45,440
odds I don't want to know we the ocean

241
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,150
confirms Moana suspicions that this is

242
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,770
Maui's Island in part because all those

243
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,180
maui fish hook doodles weren't enough

244
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,740
and in part because Moana is really

245
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,960
fucking stupid I'm here of course of

246
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,349
course yes now he always has time for

247
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:58,130
his fans

248
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,599
Maui has apparently been marooned here

249
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,340
for like a thousand years and she still

250
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,569
thinks the first person he sees and all

251
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,190
that time is a fan seeking an autograph

252
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,690
either battery's had tons of visitors

253
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,190
here seeking autographs and just never

254
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,690
stole their boats to leave the island we

255
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,430
can't play this song but the rock is a

256
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,930
way better movie musical singer than

257
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,310
Russell Crowe but that doesn't mean he's

258
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,289
good he's at least on pitch

259
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,330
he's passable that's cinebulle the rock

260
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,219
sings about killing and burying its guts

261
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,960
and somehow a coconut tree grew from it

262
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,250
this movie is really playing fast and

263
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,900
loose with evolution why is Bolin

264
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,770
enjoying this

265
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,479
she was legit angry a second ago but a

266
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,580
song turns her around and this song is

267
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,050
she even listening to the lyrics this is

268
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,279
the cockiest song ever huh Maui's

269
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,060
conscience is his tattoo why would you

270
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,250
even try this and now I'm going to love

271
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,409
you in my belly

272
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,600
sorry movie in mah belly is a registered

273
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,010
trademark owned by Mike Myers for you

274
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,420

275
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,270
get seed let's batten you up drumstick

276
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,950
[Music]

277
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,300
but also Maui has already mentioned

278
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,890
eating this chicken soon a couple times

279
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,510
so exactly how fast does he think a

280
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,980
chicken can fatten up basically the

281
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,149
ocean in this movie is an ex machina

282
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,970
fate God love and irony all rolled into

283
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,760
one giant cop-out this is my canoe and

284
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,720
you journey this movie steals the gruff

285
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
adult male has to put up with a child

286
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,480
companion he wants nothing to do with

287
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,459
thing from well a bunch of movies but

288
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,950
for now let's go with Bad Santa are you

289
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,899
afraid of her why is Maui scared of the

290
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,399
heart now I want to show to to him a few

291
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,630
minutes ago and he didn't seem even

292
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,250
remotely scared of it okay look I really

293
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,140
enjoyed this movie I did but this odd

294
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,910
monkey coconut pirate side quest is

295
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,160
fucking crazy as balls and not a good

296
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,779
way I know we're dealing with gods and

297
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,250
demigods but I reject the notion that it

298
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,570
means we also have to deal with monkey

299
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,950
like coconut pirates I reject that

300
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,780
firmly also do those coconut monkeys

301
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,340
fucking smell the heart of defeat II is

302
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,120
that how that works

303
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
mallanna is suddenly eggsy from the

304
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,330
Kingsmen movie now he pilots this boat

305
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,890
out of danger like it has a motor or -

306
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,660
point is it's a sail based boat that

307
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,040
couldn't possibly go from zero to 30

308
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,950
knots like this movie suggests seriously

309
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,210
I can't assign if alan tudyk was

310
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,770
overpaid for this voice role or

311
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,450
underpaid he does so little but it's

312
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,110
also awesome

313
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,730
that's three since removed so far and

314
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,490
they're all tudyk due date oh look the

315
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,530
omnipotent ocean nubbin is back great

316
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,620
anyone has my hook it's that beady-eyed

317
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,730
bottom-feeder and we don't have time to

318
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,230
be wrong about that this movie has to be

319
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,870
over in like 45 minutes okay first I'm

320
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,450
not a princess I'm the daughter of the

321
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,220
chief so contradicting yourself away

322
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,650
finder it will never be wait

323
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,970
this ocean doesn't thing is really

324
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,090
driving the plot look I can get down

325
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,530
with an all-knowing ocean helping the

326
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,360
want to succeed not really but for the

327
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,620
sake of this sin let's just pretend it's

328
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,240
true but I cannot get down with the same

329
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,740
all-knowing ocean understanding the

330
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,930
concept of high five why does mallanna

331
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,250
even understand what a high five is

332
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,980
you're measuring the stars not giving

333
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,620
the sky a high five still confused as

334
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,000
hell why you even know what a high five

335
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,010
is next thing you'll be fist bumping an

336
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,900
elbow pounding like Bart Maguire in the

337
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,440
current swarm you're going the right way

338
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,870
it's cold wait it's getting warmer look

339
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,610
that was just a pee in the ocean joke

340
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,350
thanks wreck first somehow rubbing off

341
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,840
on Maui white people didn't send me the

342
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,240
ocean did the ocean make sense

343
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,980
you literally watch the ocean put her in

344
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,020
the boat a few times dick the ocean

345
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,270
straight up kooky dooms now he would be

346
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,820
excellent at cinema since Yoshi chose

347
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,210
you for our freezer if you start singing

348
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,530
I'm gonna throw up

349
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,030
so the guy who sang a song within the

350
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,620
first two minutes he was on screen you

351
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,090
know the realm of Monsters is a lot less

352
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,470
scary when you realize it's also the

353
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,910
realm of ex machina because maui

354
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,500
basically ignores her down here yet she

355
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,180
frequently doesn't die buried within

356
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,670
this batch insane shiny grab song is the

357
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,020
character detail that Maui's mother

358
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,630
tossed him in the water holy that's dark

359
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,110
Jesus I got something shiny for you hot

360
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,460
off 250

361
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,350
wait earlier the monkey coconut pirates

362
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,550
knew she had the heart of defeat he

363
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,630
simply because she took it out of its

364
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,880
case they smell their sense that it's

365
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,830
magical but here the evil black light

366
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,210
loving crab thinks she's holding up the

367
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,130
heart by sight because it's not

368
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,360
actually the heart so my point is

369
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,860
basically this is this heart mystically

370
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,670
identifiable or not hey hey did you like

371
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,710
the song not particularly would have

372
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,940
been better if it were Bret McKenzie now

373
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,620
I sing something about being dead soon

374
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,570
which is hilarious but I'd like to point

375
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,800
out that this asshole went from the

376
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,720
cockiest demigod ever to a humorous

377
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,730
fatalist in about 20 minutes time man's

378
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,360
discovery of nunya what's nunya I'm your

379
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,830
business

380
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,690
2017 movie proudly displays 1950s era

381
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,970
joke why does she even fucking need Maui

382
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,800
the ocean is clearly doing all the heavy

383
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,690
lifting here they threw me into the sea

384
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,350
like I was nothing

385
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,150
yes the movie is repeating this super

386
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,890
horrible backstory but it's also super

387
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,480
horrible kind of too heavy for this

388
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,460
light of a movie so once in for a movie

389
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,780
that just had a gilded singing crab

390
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,340
showpiece trying five minutes later to

391
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,660
hit me in the gut with literal child

392
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,050
tossing somehow I was found by the gods

393
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,330
somehow they gave me the hook why

394
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,920
because you were an ocean orphan that

395
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,480
was super vain did have any reason for

396
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,950
rewarding you this hook other than your

397
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,690
being abandoned movie decides to spend

398
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,520
time with Maui's tattoos basically does

399
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,930
save money on the animation budget for a

400
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,460
while since nothing these tattoos show

401
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,500
us seems to matter after one 5-minute

402
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,210
confidence boosting conversation Maui is

403
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,510
able to properly use this hook again

404
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,560
even the ocean is tired of keeping track

405
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,570
of this stupid chiken - hands in the

406
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,490
water both gauging for warm pee if the

407
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,540
movie has taught me anything

408
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,370
I mean sure he's bonded with Milan on a

409
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,290
tiny bit lately but still I did Maui

410
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,610
agree to risk his life on this quest

411
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,860
again this looks dangerous as I assumed

412
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,300
take ah built this barrier around the

413
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,220
island so why would she leave one small

414
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,290
passageway open did Galen or so helped

415
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,680
design it

416
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,630
somehow Milan's mistake of misjudging

417
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,100
distance cost Maui his hooks power

418
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,530
somehow and yet I'm confident that it

419
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,490
won't matter and the good guys will

420
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,320
still win because Disney now he only

421
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,150
flies away here so we can Han Solo back

422
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,890
into the climax later sorry but it's the

423
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,240
truth too many minutes of the movie

424
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,860
acting like Moana is actually gonna quit

425
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,730
what is that

426
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,290
a giant ghost looking electric-blue

427
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,450
manta ray why my grandma said she'd

428
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,340
returned as a manta ray is it possible

429
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,680
that I don't dare hope that I mean you

430
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,350
know a long ways past the reef ghost

431
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,550
grandma pulls a dream Clooney from

432
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,900
gravity and I am not pleased

433
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,510
those tucking she stands apart from the

434
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,940
crowd ghosts singing in preparation for

435
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,620
this stunt Tom Cruise actually swam down

436
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,210
this distance to retrieve a mock heart

437
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,410
of defeat II but was shocked to learn

438
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,510
he'd been recast as a teenage female and

439
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,950
lost the part to an authentic Island

440
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,570
actress now he apparently not only

441
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:02,810
taught

442
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,430
wayfaring he taught her to do it while

443
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,230
under fire from a literal lava monster

444
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,029
which is to say he taught her too damn

445
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,330
good for the time allotted there's no

446
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,830
reason to be nervous about mana dropping

447
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,000
in the heart in the ocean because the

448
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,560
ocean will just give it back so stop

449
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,760
trying to make that a tense thing movie

450
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,400
you came back now he pulls the Han Solo

451
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,050
move that everyone I anticipated he

452
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,670
would pull why am I just now realizing

453
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,260
that Moana is doing all this barefooted

454
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,360
those lava rocks can be sharpish so the

455
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,680
bottoms are her feet must be on scarred

456
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,700
and blistered after this adventure

457
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,380
Claire Dearing has nothing on mallanna

458
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,060
movie totally rips off the odd parting

459
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,230
of the sea thing from Prince of Egypt

460
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,570
also movies climax basically rips off

461
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,890
the black widow lullaby from age of

462
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,620
Ultron I'm honestly surprised they

463
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,730
didn't eat the pig while she was gone

464
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:47,870
since they couldn't catch any fish if

465
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,360
it's Locka ever since cinemasins began

466
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,580
the most requested thing has been TV

467
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,390
since and now it's a reality click the

468

link in the description below to check

469
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,420
