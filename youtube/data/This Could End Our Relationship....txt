why do you really say that well I just

18
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:40,980
want them to know because you're like oh

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,000
we're only known each other ten months

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,290
but we actually hung out for a year and

21
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,289
a half yeah yes we were hanging out in

22
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,300
December November September you know

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,219
anywhere in a commercial yeah like

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,600
December we were waiting we weren't

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,890
hanging up for some of those months

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,420
though right yeah men evil times

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,539
Disneyland all that stuff was in early

28
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,070
last year we brought Katie in to fix us

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,110
up no I am I have faith in this okay

30
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,729
what are we talking about so my first

31
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,920
question I guess is to each of you can

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,240
kind of take turns or add to the story

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
but how did you meet has been a year and

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
a half since you money yeah and then

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,869
what made you start dating like how did

36
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,490
you fall in love tell me your story

37
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,409
you know I think the way we met it's

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,850
probably a big reason for all of our

39
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,909
problems which is I said to somebody oh

40
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,280
I want to date a youtuber someone that

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,450
will film with me all the time

42
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,850
and then this other person said oh I

43
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,119
know the perfect person for you it's

44
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,250
Trisha Paytas and as I call who's Trisha

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,470
Paytas and you know I looked her up and

46
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,450
then what I wouldn't hang out with her

47
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,130
she's great first five minutes I was

48
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,409
talking to her I felt like I I've known

49
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,720
her for my whole life which is really

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,579
yeah yeah really comfortable and I don't

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,899
get that with a lot of people at all

52
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,630
usually like I'm very like yeah like

53
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,100
when we first did the video I was like

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,159
you're so nervously yes like fidgeting

55
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,710
like crazy yeah very

56
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,600
nervous and fidgety and so with Trisha I

57
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,580
was like it was almost like I knew her

58
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,409
in another life or something and she was

59
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,440
very very pretty in person and not like

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,450
not like her videos or what I had seen

61
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,760
for her videos at least of her being

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,590
like you know telling everyone off and

63
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,000
I'd do it like this

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,739
she was actually pretty normal and

65
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,930
pretty grounded and like an in really

66
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,850
into having a good time which was fun

67
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,950
and by good time I mean like let's go

68
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,930
buy these blueberry muffins like you

69
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,860
know and that's probably the best thing

70
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,019
about her is that she likes some cheese

71
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,790
she likes like pretty simple things like

72
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,200
that's really what makes her happiest

73
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,910
like she loves going into this pasta

74
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,410
place and walking across the street into

75
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,610
the movies that's like her yeah she's

76
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,390
pretty simple even though she's and then

77
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,940
I guess do we say like the bad part of

78
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,290
it or no the good part are you gonna

79
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:05,060
keep going with Howard that's why we

80
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,290
need to go to there because I feel like

81
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,660
I can no but then no it was good we hung

82
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,760
out like that one time that I didn't

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,290
hear from him for like I'd like a month

84
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,810
and I saw him again one time and then

85
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,430
didn't hear from him for like a month

86
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,930
then I saw him again for one time I

87
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,269
started like bawling and going crazy he

88
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:21,560
got scared of me and didn't call me for

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,360
like months and then that's when the

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
summer came around which was so weird as

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,000
doing someone else and he started like

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
that's when December was like he asked

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
me to hang out with him which I know is

94
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,200
her vlog but it's but like it would just

95
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,430
me and him burned doesn't and me and him

96
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,480
looking at Christmas lights me and him

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,530
you know he's like let's go ice skating

98
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,090
let's go you know I always have like

99
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,040
that and I was just like okay you had a

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,930
boyfriend at the time so it was it was a

101
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,850
good it was a safety safe place for me

102
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,480
so I could be like we were just friends

103
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,500
here there was no pressure for me to be

104
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,060
like but then he would say stop commedy

105
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,350
with Ryan vlog I'm gonna reference it

106
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,670
then he would say stuff like you know I

107
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,829
really would want to date you but I kind

108
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,000
of don't know and I'm like what do you

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,230

110
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,850
minute conversation your car about how

111
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,840

112
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,090
dating me but you didn't know I maybe

113
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,829
thought about it yeah what didn't you

114
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,630

115
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,549
some you dated since your divorce not

116
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:09,490
really okay a little bit

117
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,690
not really and yeah I just just I guess

118
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,890
some of the highs and lows that she has

119
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,489
you know I scared me scared me and most

120
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,410
of the time she's like perfect and then

121
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,240
sometimes you know when we fight and

122
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
stuff it's like scary scary fights and

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,590
like and I don't know how to deal with

124
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,250
that and then and also like her her job

125
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,440
where she posts like certain things

126
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,890
online

127
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,380
I don't specifically have a problem with

128
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,030
it it doesn't bother me that stuff

129
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,290
doesn't really bother me like I choose

130
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,580
like not really think about it but like

131
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,920
for my kids and stuff like I was like

132
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,980
concerned about that right I was like oh

133
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,050
well I I don't know if I can have this

134
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,870
is gonna be a very problematic as much

135
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,790
as I liked her I knew it was gonna be

136
00:04:51,790 --> 00:05:02,200
very problematic for me yeah uh-huh

137
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,270
I mean obviously I don't you don't know

138
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,710
that I've always been like diagnosed

139
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,640
with like different things like

140
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,630
borderline personality disorder bipolar

141
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,730
I'm literally someone told me at once I

142
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,870
was like schizophrenic gave me like

143
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,610
medication for it until like yeah when I

144
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,990
was like 15 years old because I used to

145
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,520
go to like you see things that nobody

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,910
else no no chase I'd been through all of

147
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,770
it like you see animals figures in the

148
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,480
dark and stuff like that I was like no

149
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,010
so like I used to eat medications like

150
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,170
as a kid I'm like 13 to like 18 of like

151
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,820
all these different like things so I'm

152
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,890
sure there is something well I don't

153
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,420
know my not any medications for like the

154
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,040
past few years and I feel more normal

155
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,230
than ever having said that like I know

156
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,370
when you talk about the highs and lows I

157
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,960
don't really think of it as like bipolar

158
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,430
or anything that I fit honestly it feels

159
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,780
to me like I just have a really bad

160
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,550
anger problem which I know and I've been

161
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,720
able to control a little bit but I have

162
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,340
a really bad temper the dating thing

163
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,330
where he didn't want to call me his

164
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,560
girlfriend but we had just gone to Maui

165
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,030
together and so a whole week together

166
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,470
and I was like wait so why don't we why

167
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,730
aren't we dating like what is the

168
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,260
problem like yeah we hang out every day

169
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,510
it's like why can't we be dating so that

170
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,710
was the other thing that I like we went

171
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,960
to but we went to we went tomorrow I was

172
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,970
like I'll go with you and we're just

173
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,860
want to go as friends but we were

174
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,870
sitting where your friends are like

175
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,600
romantically I mean we were but we were

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,360
it was kind of a you know a jerk I kind

177
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,500
of thing yeah but they're 19 we're 45 in

178
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,310
30 and so

179
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,480
like at that point we were doing

180
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,410
everything that was dating the only

181
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,370
thing I was thinking because my biggest

182
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,720
thing is like cheating or like him like

183
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,280
Wednesday other people and I just hate

184
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,570
that in a relationship and I like we are

185
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,620
hanging out like two months at this

186
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,090
point and it's just like okay so you

187
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,170
just don't want to be with me or you're

188
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,310
looking for something better like I was

189
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,810
just so confused and I was like then

190
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,250
when you would blow up at me I would be

191
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,380
like I hadn't blown up with you at that

192
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,610
point no I don't think it's warranted I

193
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,320
think I think so she says things to me

194
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,190
like you you made me get angry like and

195
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,740
like no no one should be that angry over

196
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,690
whatever I do you know what I mean like

197
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,390
there's no there's no reason for

198
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,830
uncontrollable anger towards me no

199
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,600
matter what I do I've been everything

200
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,770
you got to yeah

201
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,690
have you heard of like I statements

202
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:11,560
versus but the like you made me tends to

203
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,480
cause people to get defensive and shut

204
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,280
down yeah and so if we can say like I

205
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,020
felt angry or I'm angry because I it

206
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,580
would be important to me to feel like

207
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,630
I'm your girlfriend because I'm afraid

208
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,090
you know I I have trust issues and it

209
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,890
would make me feel more secure versus

210
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,350
like you made me angry yeah allows him

211
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,380
to hear you versus like potentially shut

212
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,970
down and feel attacked I'd say we did

213
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,050
break up I wasn't this like if we break

214
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,880
up I should find someone that would want

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,590
to like be with me commit and like know

216
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,610
them for a couple years and like have

217
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,990
kids and like to find that it's gonna

218
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,250
take me years and then I'll be too old

219
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,390
you know what time it all happens so

220
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,320
part of me is like maybe you're just

221
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,310
gonna have kids I don't know I'm not

222
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,080
like totally like I want him but it's

223
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
also like if he doesn't I'm not gonna

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,950
 she also she also tells me like

225
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,770
really send me different messages so

226
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,110
much mmm like there's times when you're

227
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,820
like I really want kids and then I've

228
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,950
seen the other times be like oh my god I

229
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,170
could never do this well you do the same

230
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,430
thing with me doesn't rhyme jack I could

231
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,630
have one kid with you maybe and then

232
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,100
you're like I don't want kids at all so

233
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,370
you did the same thing it's such a big

234
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,320
commitment if it's like waffling on

235
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,360
regular things like getting married

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
shouldn't be something you go in and out

237
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,510
of until you're like you know I mean

238
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,950
obviously you can think about it on your

239
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,080
own but you shouldn't like maybe I don't

240
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,840
know

241
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,610
maybe I love that's not that's not gonna

242
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,250
bring us anywhere healthy but like

243
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,350
children is something you can talk about

244
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,389
hopefully even though you don't think

245
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,040
you want anymore and you're not even

246
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,570
100% sure but you'd like to have the

247
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,310
option yeah and being able to have that

248
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,620
conversation should be okay for you to

249
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,360
both if you could both hear each other

250
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,550
mmm because it my guess is and I could

251
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,380
be completely wrong it sounds like you

252
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,180
start talking and then you get angry

253
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,800
because he'll say something that like

254
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,330
it's absolutely like two tips you and

255
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,770
then you shut down and then you're just

256
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,980
like no I do I said she was angry I shut

257
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,390
down because she she can't be spoken to

258
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,570
where do you think that anger comes from

259
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,350
yeah I do I don't know I think it's just

260
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,240
something I guess for me when I was her

261
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,330
age I had a temper to bring or trauma or

262
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,790
like as a kid yeah but to me it wasn't

263
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,170
traumatic like when I talked to

264
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,730
therapists I was like oh well that's the

265
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,020
reason this or whatever and it's like

266
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,370
when I was going toward all it wasn't

267
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,300
traumatic to me and like when I think

268
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,190
back about it like I can I can talk

269
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,570
about it and like it's not traumatic

270
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,250
without Tom about it I'll be like oh I

271
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,930
think it wasn't that big of a deal I get

272
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,610
hurt really easily but I think that's

273
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,380
more from like my dad not coming around

274
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,400
you know anything because my dad would

275
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,870
help like when they got divorced we

276
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,070
moved to Illinois I was born here Mucha

277
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,390
Illinois my dad moved back to California

278
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,790
basically he saw sometimes it's not and

279
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,900
then my mom had like a different

280
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,640
boyfriend like every week you know so

281
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,260
like I feel like that was like a lot

282
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,700
because I didn't like fighting me along

283
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,240
with my mom

284
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,709
I felt like my dad hated me and like all

285
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,459
that stuff like that so I think that's

286
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,959
it and people like leaving me is a huge

287
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,820
thing it's always been that might be

288
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,560
what people like suspected borderline

289
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,560
personality disorder definitely part of

290
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,380
it and do you like develop it it's not

291
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,459
what you're born with borderline

292
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,020
personality III mean I believe you

293
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,339
develop it everybody has different

294
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,160
thoughts on this um but I believe it's

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,620
born out of trauma mostly

296
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,900
saying but I think that trauma I think

297
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,220
people think trauma has to be this big

298
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,100
thing like it's big but it can also be

299
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,990
like a lot of little things like dad not

300
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,520
being around maybe parents fighting a

301
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,860
lot I'm like poor like bipolar disorder

302
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,210
borderline personality disorder is like

303
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,340
episodic within a day meaning like

304
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,530
episode of like feeling really energized

305
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,330
really good really excited and then like

306
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,980
super depressed super angry super fat

307
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,660
shaming and then back we go and that can

308
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,100
be like I don't know five or six times a

309
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,860
day where bipolar disorder isn't as

310
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,350
quick I mean most people not people are

311
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,330
now I'm getting like really like

312
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,830
cyclothymic means they like cycle

313
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,750
quickly but even then it's like once a

314
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,370
week or so they'll have something so

315
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,680
just considering like the timeline of it

316
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,330
is usually as a therapist how you would

317
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,310
like tease that out to figure out what

318
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,930
it is and I'm not saying you have any of

319
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,310
those yeah yeah I'm just saying that

320
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,990
like that's kind of that's probably why

321
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,790
you've had those different diagnoses

322
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,380
around but I don't thing is I don't know

323
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,520
if it has to do with it or anything but

324
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,170
even when I'm like being really nice to

325
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,490
be so me and stuff like I can be like

326
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,520
verbally like um like I know I'm doing

327
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,170
it like I'm not like unaware like I'm

328
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,550
like oh my god like I cannot control and

329
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,530
I feel so bad like within like a few

330
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,150
hours I'd like apologize I'm I'm so

331
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,530
sorry you don't I mean like I hope mad

332
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,880
about it but like I don't know what that

333
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,890
is I think that's just anger it could be

334
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,020
but anger comes out of hurt yeah like

335
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,760
that's I mean I was even an angry kid

336
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,410
like I was like I could be super mean to

337
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,060
people and it was because I needed to

338
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,800
process through like stuff I was going

339
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,360
through because I was feeling hurt and I

340
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,770
was feeling like ignored what do you

341
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,230
suggest when we run into a situation

342
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,800
where we're arguing and she's in set off

343
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,930
there's a couple things first like I'd

344
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,610
have homework for you where I need you

345
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,040
to try to pay attention to how it feels

346
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,710
before even using instances where you've

347
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,780
already had blown up like if you once

348
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,880
you pull down think back to like when

349
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,500
was a trigger like she says she'll say

350
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,060
my different weeks she'll say the most

351
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,590
she'll say like the most hurtful thing

352
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,860
to me and then I'm like and then I go

353
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,360
I'm done that's it

354
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,160
never talking to you again I was taking

355
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,110
care of my kids the other day Trish was

356
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,490
here and we were like having a hard time

357
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,540
like deciding what we're gonna do

358
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,010
because one kid wanna do one thing and

359
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,750
one can learn another and we were gonna

360
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,520
maybe go to Disneyland and like anyway

361
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,900
so then Trisha had to go to the

362
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,090
recording studio and was like if you

363
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,490
guys want to go to Disneyland just go

364
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,680
that's fine it was like okay yes and I

365
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,670
was just like concerned with the kids

366
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,990
well so then that's when I made plans

367
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,430
whatever it's like not huge deal

368
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,600
whatever I think she went to go to

369
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,130
recording studio in my mind which was

370
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,690
like oh that's really good like that's

371
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,800
something that I would want to go do

372
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,060
like and make it work on an album that's

373
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,010
all awesome like go do it definitely and

374
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,149
I'll take care of my kids just my

375
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,920
responsibility and she looked at it more

376
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,660
like oh like I was trying to get rid of

377
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,390
it as soon as I left he's like oh we're

378
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,100
going to seal and I was like okay cuz it

379
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,330
was so tense by the way he'd left out

380
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,589
this part cuz he's also I mean he's also

381
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:42,790
conflict' like he has bad mood swings

382
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,890
like not often but when he does he gets

383
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,750
so angry too and you know you can get

384
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,510
raging so that morning he was just not

385
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,610
he knew he was grumpy yeah he was like

386
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,950
miserable he even sat like I was you

387
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,970
know like he had the worst weekend ever

388
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,320
like who said on the podcast and then

389
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,490
you went to Varna and they were happy so

390
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,380
he was like miserable all day before a

391
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,490
fight we had

392
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,200
no you're immiscible in the morning bait

393
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,670
when I was still here okay so both of

394
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,170
you get angry but you might have a

395
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,170
longer fuse but yours might be worse if

396
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,190
you're like my brother my brother was

397
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,630
like now taking forever to get pissed

398
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,709
off and then once he's mad you're like

399
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,520
everybody

400
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,490
yeah that's oh yeah so both of you need

401
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,470
to recognize the symptoms earlier like

402
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,520
that's something that I feel like we

403
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,690
should all be working on is like

404
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,550
noticing before and I know it feels like

405
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,380
it's like though like this thing yeah

406
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,450
but if it is that way then we're gonna

407
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,070
have to find when you know it's

408
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,510
happening like whatever those first

409
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,680
symptoms are when you're like that

410
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,329
thought and all of a sudden you switch

411
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,720
to be like oh you kidding and then we're

412
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,130
gonna have to implement some tools so

413
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,480
like that's what we try to get like the

414
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,950
whole goal of therapy in my mind is like

415
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,079
getting space space between a thought or

416
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,790
an emotion and an action even if you're

417
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,860
mad totally find it mad scream in your

418
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,000
car throw things I don't care yeah or

419
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,220
find something that calms you down both

420
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,600
of you guys because I have feeling you

421
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,279
probably feel it you might be able to

422
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,260
notice when your fuse is lit before

423
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,640
you're gonna blow up but yours might be

424
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,890
like yeah I feel like it's like

425
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,660
triggered by like something because like

426
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,579
if I react so like emotionally like

427
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:05,470
quickly I don't let things like build up

428
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,820
so I don't like think of like ifs I mean

429
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,220
me it's always like I don't know it

430
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,450
sounds like it's more to do with like

431
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,760
inclusion and

432
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,000
yeah so like including her and things

433
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,889
and feel a part of something I think is

434
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,380
important to you or for you I don't know

435
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm not as I'm not too sure what set you

436
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,709
off last time she just goes for the most

437
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,899
awful place just says like really really

438
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,459
hurtful things what about in the past

439
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,769
like sauce Trisha like what are other

440
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,110
situations that have like senator sent

441
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,820
me off I think most of the time in the

442
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,410
past I was like just frustrated with

443
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,449
myself if I was like forced to do stuff

444
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:37,920
that I didn't want to do when I was

445
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,240
married I would that would like make me

446
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,449
make me upset or whatever so any feel

447
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,010
like your controls taken away yeah are

448
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,720
just like my oh my god not like making

449
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,220
my own decisions or like I'm living my

450
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,410
life for other people I feel that way

451
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,149
like a lot on my life I'm just gonna say

452
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,100
it sounds like in like its total outside

453
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,630
perspective but it sounds like in a way

454
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,130
like a lot of things that are set up for

455
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,740
you even now yes still that way it's

456
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,139
like my whole life is set up yeah just

457
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,430
like even the children thing you know

458
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,220
this is we love your kids like yeah same

459
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,680
but like that even takes it's about them

460
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,089
like you're like I just I'm doing the

461
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,230
thing for me that's my responsibility

462
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,089
yeah I have to do this it's not really

463
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:13,949
about you it's about that yes

464
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,380
maybe Trisha is like the only place that

465
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,839
you hope you can still do what you want

466
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,060
have control maybe I don't know whatever

467
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,730
I mean maybe it's better if I say it

468
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,130
this way like what area of your life do

469
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,100
you feel like you have the most control

470
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,790
do it somewhere I'm filming okay that's

471
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,069
like it's almost like a if I'm not

472
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,160
filming or working and I'm like

473
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,240
completely lost

474
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,130
so is there other things she could do to

475
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,019
make you feel better like more in

476
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,170
control no she does a really good job

477
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,060
that like game like oh you don't have

478
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,130
you know you don't have to stress and

479
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,170
you have to work so hard and don't worry

480
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,149
about it she's really good at that it's

481
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,529
just my own thing that I do I should

482
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,720
Christine probably get over her well

483
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,280
figure it out you know as my life is

484
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,350
going by and I'm like spending like my

485
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,760
downtime like sleeping sleeping or like

486
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,370
sleeping a lot lately or like being like

487
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,980
I should be fully just like yeah I

488
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,630
should be working like pick your poison

489
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,340
oh my god they're sleeping all day or my

490
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,230
like stressing right or likes let's say

491
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,150
it's the time when I'm with my kids that

492
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,340
time like I'm enjoying it with them but

493
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:31,380
I'm also like and that's the only times

494
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,940
I do get angry are those like time zone

495
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,710
that many like we do really well like

496
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,200
the last blow-up was yeah this is just

497
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,640
my thing but before that was just the

498
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,990
moving-in thing and before that was the

499
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,130
dating thing that was it I mean those

500
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,960
are the three big blobs I know of even

501
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,160
when we've broken up before over like

502
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,300
stupid things like I feel like we don't

503
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,470
really like blow up each other like

504
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,670
cause like yeah figuring out what sets

505
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,320
both of you off like just being aware

506
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,820
like even if it's just like notes in

507
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,260
your phone or journaling I mean I'd like

508
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,730
to journal personally but not a real

509
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,740
exam but even just noting like in how it

510
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,210
feels in your body like for me if I'm

511
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,310
getting hurt I swallow a lot I think

512
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,540
it's like I think it's like me

513
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,740
swallowing my feelings that's what I

514
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,569
imagine happening but then I started

515
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,829
getting angry because I'm frustrated

516
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,630
because I feel bad because even though

517
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,680
feels like you have a really short fuse

518
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,630
I have a feeling this there's certain

519
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,410
buttons like connectedness knowing he's

520
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,120
gonna be there for you like security

521
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,699
trusts for you it might be like no one

522
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,890
considers you you're doing everything

523
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,300
for everybody else like when those

524
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,949
buttons are pushed you know just paying

525
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,750
attention and then recognizing I think

526
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,010
you should tech like tell each other

527
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,750
what those buttons are so you know so

528
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,980
yeah like I think like the other day I

529
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,080
said something like she was here in the

530
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
morning and I said something like okay

531
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,170
well let's get you out of here she had

532
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,820
that she had like all these costumes and

533
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,040
stuff and she took it as like I want him

534
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,630
get you out of here cuz I always like

535
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,920
that when I stay at this house cuz even

536
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,180
with his kids and everyone was just

537
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,410
sitting around doing nothing and he

538
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,580
wasn't making a decision as like a DAB

539
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,080
you nicaraguan isn't that or like you

540
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,730
know dude well I'm saying though I

541
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,380
always feel like I should be not here

542
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,210
like I always feel unlovable even like

543
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,500
the other night as it should I leave

544
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,390
should I say like I'm not it's just

545
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,380
making sure that right

546
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,180
just received yeah you can do him a

547
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,850
favor and let him know like when not in

548
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,650
the heat of the moment like even now

549
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,570
like what could he do so that you know

550
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,160
you're welcome and if you did if you did

551
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,260
say that to me if you stop for and like

552
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,020
kind of verbalize your feelings that

553
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,520
would help and I'll try to do it to like

554
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,290
I feel like I've ever had

555
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,550
thanks up for that then I'm just like

556
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,750
woman he doesn't wanna be with me maybe

557
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,830
like there was a good reason he's not

558
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,640
you know what I mean that's the only

559
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,110
thing that like other than that I really

560
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,020

561
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,070
because he's like really nice really

562
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,930

563
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,100
like it's a really good relationship but

564
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,240
I might maybe it's not real maybe he

565
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,050
doesn't like want to be with me

566
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,280
long-term I don't know that's the only

567
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,690
thing other than that other than like

568
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,890

571
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm like you know there's things there's

572

581
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,410
never once said that to me what was I

582
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,670
wearing I don't even remember what you

583
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,410
said I don't know what it was about

584
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,810
something that was like revealing you've

585
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,850
never told me that what I mean I love I

586
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,530
said I'd like I've said like with my

587
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,000
friends like you know like put your

588
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
clothes on or if I walk in and like you

589
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,150
have like no clothes on in front of my

590
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,140
friends or something you know that

591
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,910
upsets you also say it jokingly on a

592
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,170
vlog of David so I didn't know that was

593
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,140
an actual issue when the cameras not be

594
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,240
like put suppose you don't take that I

595
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,910
do I mean if she gets angry - I find

596
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,290
people when were angry we don't remember

597
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,170
yes we're just maxed out but if that

598
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,060
isn't if she's not angry I think yeah I

599
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,170
always thought that was like Emily

600
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,370
thought as a joke because obviously I'm

601
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,200
like a very entrance if I didn't uh I

602
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,070
told you so

603
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,940
okay so she's usually pretty good I

604
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,620
always yeah the time like so shocked it

605
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:59,890
was like more like Army's like thank you

606
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,540
she'll help something close on I think

607
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,340
it's almost like sweet because it's like

608
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,830
no you

609
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,320
I get it but also that's like you knew

610
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,130
that about me

611
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,990
you knew ever knows and you know I just

612
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,940
sexy and like no I know

613
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,830
so it's okay yeah it's not really fair

614
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,210
is it well I don't know it's kind of

615
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,710
weird like me trying to change a

616
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,870
comedian and being like in the room

617
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,530
right yeah but you know maybe every so

618
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,260
often you can do in the favor I mean the

619
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,760
most the time you just do you I do wear

620
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,080
a lot of like t-shirts I always have

621
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,309
like your t-shirt on and like such I

622
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,080
