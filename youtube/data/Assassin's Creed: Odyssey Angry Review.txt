[Music]

9
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,540
guys we are so stupid I have to preface

10
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,520
this review by saying we were going to

11
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
scrap it we were not gonna do an

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,660
assassin's creed review because that was

13
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,580
meant to be filmed outside we couldn't

14
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,980
use the full opportunist song apparently

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,890
it was made in like the 70s 80s and and

16
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,080
it still copyright so we kept getting

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,479
taken down for it so that's why I had to

18
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,890
change the song it didn't really work

19
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,570
out the way I wanted the green screen

20
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,970
was crappy you know we wanted to use

21
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,770
this badass slow-mo camera but we only

22
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,660
had it for a short time and we couldn't

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,330
make it work but so I had to throw that

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,090
crappy thing together but hopefully our

25
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,520
goofiness still made you laugh and

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
instead of scrapping the review I wanted

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,090
to do something so I sat us down and you

28
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,980
know just film this quick review and

29
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,110
this isn't gonna be a regular thing and

30
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,450
unless you guys like this style but you

31
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,430
know I wanted to put something out for

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,200
you and this will give you a good idea

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
of whether the game is for you or not

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,010
and what we think of it because I really

35
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,989
wanted to put something up because this

36
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,670
is the most exciting Assassin's Creed

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,220
since you know Black Flag so it's a

38
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,570
different style but I hope you guys

39
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,430
enjoy and yeah I'll leave some feedback

40
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,830
in the comments but we've got to move on

41
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,780
cuz broke Tober is here and Call of

42
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,970
Duty's already outed and Red Dead

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,800
Redemption we got so many other games to

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,690
cover so let's try to do it man all

45
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:25,310
right thank you sighs guys so much enjoy

46
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,709
welcome to the Assassin's Creed Odyssey

47
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,360
review guys I am doing something

48
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,010
different today but don't worry we're

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,240
gonna get into the nitty-gritty I'm

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,709
going to tell you whether it's worth it

51
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,560
the controversy about the

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
microtransactions and whether it's a

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,470
good game or not so today with me here I

54
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,930
have a Spartan warrior and Alex because

55
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,520
these gentlemen have played the game

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,760
right okay and I think Dell what have

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,500
you played the game till you you finish

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,370
like level 50 done right and we'll talk

59
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,269
about that okay so so welcome Assassin's

60
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,100
Creed what is it about well in my

61
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,570
opinion it is the most exciting you know

62
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,819
Assassin's Creed since Black Flag and

63
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,830
that's the impression I got when I start

64
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,390
first started playing you have this

65
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,940
beautiful sequence which shows all these

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,560
Greek islands and this it's just so

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,160
colorful you at the eagle flying it is

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,900
beautiful and when you look at the map

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,970
the first time you zoom out on this map

70
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,729
you're like my god there is so much

71
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:30,350
content and this part of the reason why

72
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,790
we're having to rush this review and do

73
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,410
something a little different because

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,750
there's just too much content and I

75
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,020
didn't plan for it but is that content

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:46,270
good and and what's the problem with

77
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,830
that's the biggest problem it doesn't

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,110
feel like you're doing engaging or

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,850
active things throughout the game did

80
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,940
you see dunky dunky videos but he's got

81
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,100
a point yeah you're getting you're like

82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,260
this Greek hero with a legendary weapon

83
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,760
everyone knows who you are either the

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,620
Eagle Bearer and they're just like go

85
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,490
get my laundry bitch right okay I'll do

86
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,520
that because I'm a helpful guy and the

87
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,650
lack of reviewers mentioning this this

88
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,830
sort of grind that now I kind of tested

89
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,720
the waters and I mentioned it on Twitter

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,270
and I got a lot of blowback from fans

91
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,450
though I've had no problem grinding Joe

92
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,090
never at any point did I feel like I

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,919
have to do any grinding in order to do

94
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,690
the next mission and I'm like really

95
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,580
like what the fuck and he's like you

96
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,289
just suck at the game you know and I'm

97
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,030
like no I've been playing games for like

98
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,620
you know a lot my whole life

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm one of those players where I'll play

100
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,669
the main mission through and I'll do

101
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,530
some side missions and then for the

102
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,690
review I go on a second difficulty and I

103
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,490
blow through almost all the content that

104
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,880
I can and in this first mission I ran

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,310
into several times where the missions

106
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,979
dropped off and it's like beat up ten

107
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,560
bandit camps you know do this and that

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
and it may be that those players were

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,220
going to every they were exploring and

110
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,410
they were synchronizing at every spot

111
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,889
and they were discovering every little

112
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,260
area where you grab experience and

113
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,449
that's what they were doing and I was or

114
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,880
maybe they were using boosters and lying

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,680
about it and not saying like you're

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,600
using boosters oh no I never used a

117
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,860
booster you know well if they

118
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,479
pre-ordered one of the advanced copies

119
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,010
they think they got a booster for free

120
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,750
like a temporary booster they got like a

121
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,910
four-day one so it was like they

122
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,410
probably had it running and didn't even

123
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,900
know yeah I was a little surprised at

124
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,449
how many reviewers laughs never

125
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:34,710
mentioned it or I was reading through

126
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,539
the reviews and they was very small and

127
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,190
there were several times in my

128
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,250
playthrough I think it was level 13

129
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,430
through 14 15 16 where you had to do one

130
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,139
and then there was one later on and then

131
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,729
when you get to the endgame that's all

132
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,599
it is it's nothing binding right because

133
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,370
you start scaling things up too it's

134
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,650
like oh you have to be 33 well time to

135
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,750
go do 50 side quests or grind the arena

136
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,580
for two hours or something like that and

137
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,800
it's it just that's with a booster you

138
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,860
still have to grind so I don't even know

139
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,360
how crazy it would be for people that

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,070
didn't pay money for a booster didn't

141
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,840
have a booster it was a surfer ever bull

142
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,060
yeah it was miserable Island

143
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,289
yeah it was absolutely miserable I mean

144
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,070
I I played we got we rented it off red

145
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,289
box for three days oh damn you did the

146
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,030
smart thing yeah well I mean I'd watch

147
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,560
you play it and then you run into some

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,639
things like all right I'll give this a

149
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,590
shot one thing that we got on the

150
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,849
PlayStation so we didn't see any of the

151
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,380
bugs a lot of people were talking about

152
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,669
where the people are flying around with

153
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:30,780
rag dolls so there's none of that going

154
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,210
on but there was definitely parts where

155
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,800
it's like hey will you go deliver this

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,020
to somebody it's like I'm I'm like a

157
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,130
legendary no I'm not gonna go do that

158
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,930
and so when I would see more and more of

159
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,490
these missions it's like okay I'd do one

160
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,080
every now and then and then you get two

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,580
points where you just cannot progress

162
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,560
without being an errand boy right and I

163
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,810
don't I mean if I paid $60

164
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,970
to sign up to do chores for somebody

165
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,050
like this is not the kind of game like

166
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,450
you want to explore the vineyards and

167
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,550
the the huge I mean it's a beautiful

168
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,320
open world and I want to explore that

169
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,420
but I don't want to just go like Oh kill

170
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,810
kill 40 large rats in front of the gates

171
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,400
of the fort before you can move on into

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,040
the next stage exactly so so a lot of

173
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,620
the quests especially the side missions

174
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,840
feel a little below average and that's

175
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,670
probably what alex is tapping into a lot

176
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,740
of below average side quests because

177
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,060
honestly the side quests are nowhere

178
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,460
near as exciting and say which are

179
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,440
threes or Red Dead Redemption the

180
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,960
original one thing I have a problem with

181
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,730
is they don't they're not side quests

182
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,500
they don't feel like side quests because

183
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,210
they're required you cannot move on

184
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,099
without doing some number of them and so

185
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,750
well some people are lying to me they're

186
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,450
like Joe I know I'm on the main path and

187
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,890
I'm doing your mother fuckers their line

188
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,130
but okay so we we put that out there but

189
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,160
the reason why it's so difficult for me

190
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,290
and I think why some press were

191
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,450
defending the game probably erroneously

192
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,940
and getting snippy about it like that

193
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,470
one guy like was like shitting on

194
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,390
youtubers or something like why are you

195
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,060
so defending that doesn't make any sense

196
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,570
to me

197
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,460
because these number one and I'm about

198
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,640
to get into an angry rant here the

199
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,020
microtransactions do not need to be

200
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,480
there they don't they don't need to be

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,970
there an assassin's creed Odyssey were

202
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,620
they there to a less degree yes they

203
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,780
were there less degree origins I mean

204
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,210
and in previous Assassin's Creed's they

205
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,850
started putting him in but even before

206
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,710
that they weren't in there and so

207
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,440
anybody who loves the Assassin's Creed

208
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,080
franchise there should be no reason your

209
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,480
Oh doesn't matter doesn't affect

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,020
anything

211
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,150
why are you advocating for this

212
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,060
franchise to become more and more at

213
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,870
danger and at risk because you know once

214
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,420
these things you could kiss the legacy

215
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
of Assassin's Creed goodbye because once

216
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,440
these things get in the game they're

217
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,090
gonna get bigger they're gonna get more

218
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,530
intrusive they're gonna be more

219
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,930
exploitive as years go on yep they're

220
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,060
not right now but in the future they are

221
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,360
from I mean just from origins to Odyssey

222
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,460
I reviewed origins and origins they were

223
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,740
they were a nice thing if you bought

224
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,430
them they gave you

225
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,410
a slight advantage like you could get

226
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,720
money you could you know me upgrade

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,540
yourself a little bit further but it

228
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,120
wasn't like you have to do this to not

229
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,770
have to do everything else in the game

230
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,410
and from origins to Odyssey it felt like

231
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,050
they were way more focused in Odyssey

232
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,880
than they were in origins yes I went

233
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,350
through the entirety of origins without

234
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,970
using anything other than like one or

235
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,730
two cosmetics and in Odyssey it was like

236
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,880
you could do the same thing in Odyssey

237
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,490
look don't get me wrong you could go

238
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,320
through the entire game without spending

239
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,430
we're not trying to give you the

240
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,870
impression that you're forced to spend

241
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,089
money the only time you feel forced to

242
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,520
spend money is when you want to upgrade

243
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,420
an Armour set or a weapon up to your

244
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,950
current level and you want to do that

245
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,899
more than once or twice because the

246
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,180
amount of resources it cost to do these

247
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,700
things are pretty insane now if you

248
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,320
don't care about that the game is meant

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,540
to be like destiny I think in many ways

250
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,610
where you just forget all that just keep

251
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,709
grinding and get the next set of weapons

252
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,420
and where that get the next set of armor

253
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,620
and where that don't worry about

254
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,149
anything that you got before however

255
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,800
that starts to suck because when you're

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,959
getting legendary armor sets you want to

257
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,910
wear those things but you got it at

258
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,670
level 27 or whatever and then you know

259
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,070
level 35 you're like well I don't like

260
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,510
this legend there I want to wear that

261
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,980
one and you upgrade now it's gonna cost

262
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,140
you a lot its in-game it's really

263
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,180
ridiculous too because it's it's like

264
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,950
you know people go oh you could just

265
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,540
like scrap things down and it's like

266
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,250
I've got this full armor of Achilles I

267
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,180
want to wear I want to look like

268
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,250
Achilles that's a huge hero and they're

269
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,660
like oh just scrap stuff down and you'll

270
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,190
start doing it you look at it and it's

271
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,459
like something like 35 or 30 weapons you

272
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,820
got a breakdown it's like yeah so we hit

273
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,040
on a lot of what we think are the

274
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,390
negatives of the game where there's a

275
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,400
bit of a grind the side missions are

276
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,560
below average even the main storyline

277
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,220
for the most part starts pretty slow it

278
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,440
only picks up a little later on after

279
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,390
you get past that level 15 it starts to

280
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,220
pick up a little bit once you visit

281
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,070
Athens and you get both the context of

282
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,020
Sparta and Athens it starts to pick up

283
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,029
but but all right so let's talk about

284
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,130
some of the pros of the game tell me

285
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,899
something that you enjoyed about the

286
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,000
game one it was pretty yeah very pretty

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,310
very pretty game I think that's probably

288
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,550
its strongest

289
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,830
in my opinion is it's beautiful like the

290
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,630
whole world is beautiful the armor looks

291
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,089
amazing everything looks great

292
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,880
and that was what carried most of me

293
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,500
through the game was everywhere I went I

294
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,870
was like that looked good yeah good it's

295
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,120
a ridiculously large open world it's

296
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
double the map size of origins so

297
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,440
there's lots of content there's the

298
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,269
naval battles is one of the things that

299
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:46,000
I liked I thought the the I love the sea

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
battles having your own ship it's the

301
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,570
best ever

302
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,670
there's ramming there singing there's

303
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,380
recruiting what I like the most is

304
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,850
recruiting people in the world like oh I

305
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,589
love that guy's armor I want to see him

306
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,360
on my ship all the time and now he's on

307
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,709
my ship all the time and he's are giving

308
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,630
me bonuses to the arrows now it's not

309
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,600
quite arrows and javelins not quite as

310
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,810
impactful as fucking cannons slamming

311
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,399
into your shrimp shop like shrapnel

312
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,640
going everywhere right that is the only

313
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,380
disappointing part of it but other than

314
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,240
that the naval battles have never been

315
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,040
better and I hope we could go back to

316
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,630
pirates up and don't forget you can go

317
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,670
underwater you can find sunken cities

318
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,709
there's sharks that you could fight a

319
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:32,589
lot of shark fights that I add what else

320
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:34,720
I think the the video capture they did

321
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,490
with like with the character speaking

322
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,990
looked really really good yeah for the

323
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,029
main characters that look good they

324
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,170
looked really good because in the

325
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,149
previous last couple they kind of look

326
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:44,500
weird where like the mouth would start

327
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,440
moving up the side of the face the main

328
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,820
character would be like animated and

329
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,470
you'd be talking to like a side

330
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,000
character and he'd just be like I need

331
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,470
help my daughter is dead

332
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,029
right right exactly and his face was

333
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,800
just talking but that's a little bit

334
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,480
still here cuz I do want to say that

335
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,310
sometimes the accents are kind of bad

336
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,980
yeah there is stiff facial animations

337
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,300
but it mostly has to do with the side

338
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,730
characters on the side missions but they

339
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,899
put attention elsewhere what do you

340
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,940
think about the combat it kind of feels

341
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,500
a little bit more tired like fighting

342
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,970
the the characters with shields it's

343
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,360
just such a dress repetitive yeah and

344
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,089
it's you know I wanted more assassin II

345
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,579
style things with less like alright well

346
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:25,560
you know I'm fighting

347
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,089
guys are shields at homecoming this is a

348
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,560
little bit more boring than I want I

349
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,759
want to do more sneaking around

350
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,430
thank you I liked it and and I didn't

351
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,019
mind it I thought it was appropriate for

352
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,269
the time period I liked how this one is

353
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:37,829
a little more skill and ability based

354
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,839
where you do press a button rip the

355
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,300
shield off press a button sparta fucking

356
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,309
kick I was Sparta kicking dudes all day

357
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:47,579
long off of cliffs is the most fun to do

358
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,499
I just saw I thought the combat was

359
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:51,930
improved I loved the sea battles

360
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,170
ridiculously large open world mythic

361
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,569
beasts as far as the combat though goes

362
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,720
I will say this it was fun but good god

363
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,120
wasn't easy to break like oh yeah the

364
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,649
combat I was getting to the point where

365
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,180
I was doing millions of damage like

366
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,889
literally millions of damage on

367
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,660
headshots and stuff yeah it's just like

368
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,199
all the challenge got but when you're

369
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,180
doing millions of damage don't you you

370
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,370
gotta be like level 30 you got to be

371
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,540
like level 4050 at that point it was

372
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,579
like level 36 I was just like one

373
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,550
shotting everyone even level 50 guys was

374
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,720
like okay what do I do now more pros I

375
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,870
love to move to RPG stuff I like the

376
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,399
dialogue options I really think that

377
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,829
adds something fresh and new to the

378
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,750
universe though it is a little awkward

379
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,160
you could tell that this is the first

380
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,620
time they're really sort of expanding it

381
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,689
like romance options that shit was

382
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,990
awkward and it was like the riding on it

383
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,040
was really bad it was like hey do you

384
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,569
want to have sex hey do you want to have

385
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:52,860
sex no now right now hey do you want to

386
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,420
have sex well go do this for me hey

387
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,100
anyone have sex okay if you go get this

388
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,509
and maybe but maybe not

389
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,040
okay do you want to have sex now okay

390
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,389
let's have sex and then you go in and

391
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,399
the entire town had died from plague and

392
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,139
this girl made me do a side quest and

393
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,819
her family was dead and she's like

394
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,679
standing next to all the dead bodies and

395
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,569
I walk up and I go hey you wanna bang

396
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:18,089
and she's like oh yes let's do it right

397
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,490
here in front of the corpse but that

398
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,399
does that does remind me of the dialogue

399
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,290
option so they get so their first

400
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,819
implementing it and I'll give them a

401
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,529
pass on this because sometimes the

402
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,029
dialogue options feel like they don't

403
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:30,809
mean jack shit

404
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,120
but sometimes they do because early on

405
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
in the game you can make a decision on

406
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,269
whether people are sick on that first

407
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,610
island and if you do the fucked up thing

408
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,089
and you're

409
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:41,100
now kill those people you know then that

410
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,749
Island will still be okay later on in

411
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:44,189
the game if you don't then I think that

412
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,670
Island is sick and people are dead on

413
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,059
that island but um other pros they cut

414
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,559
out they cut out most of the real world

415
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,529
stuff oh I love it I love getting no

416
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,350
more Abstergo no future shit I fucking

417
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,149
hate that stuff and in this game

418
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,769
Assassin's Creed Odyssey that is the

419
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,679
least amount in the game it's it's you

420
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,689
know it takes 15 hours to get to the

421
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,549
next scene of that and I was just so

422
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,039
immersed in the Odyssey in the Spartan

423
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,980
verse app and war that I liked

424
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,449
unfortunately the quest battle conquest

425
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,370
battles the war just didn't matter

426
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:24,510
yeah and nothing you do matters

427
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,699
you could go assassinate the leader of

428
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,500
Sparta you know then five minutes later

429
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,360
they're like hey Alexios how you doing

430
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,740
man and you're like all right so I'm

431
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,179
gonna rattle off some of the rest of

432
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,250
these pros here so we can jump to the

433
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,679
rest of our cons so I love the fact that

434
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,419
there's the male female choice I went

435
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,899
with Cassandra what did y'all guys do

436
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,549
Sondra I just couldn't stand Alexia's

437
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,110
voice actor I thought Cassandra did a

438
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,419
much better job boys acting she was she

439
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,649
was odd yeah

440
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,600
the mythic beasts I love that they're

441
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,309
putting in more fantasy elements these

442
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,870
are a lot of good things in the game

443
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,120
this why I think it earns higher scores

444
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,830
amongst some of those reviewers but they

445
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,570
didn't really go as in-depth and

446
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,370
exploring the economy how many mythic

447
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:13,830
beasts were there yeah yeah and one of

448
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,330
them's not accessible to the end but

449
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,399
coming from origins yes the beasts are

450
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:21,480
cool but the origins boss fights like a

451
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
new business ship he had mechanics he

452
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,409
threw many eggs at you summon dust

453
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,149
storms and a lot of the mythic nice in

454
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,010
this game were just kind of generic

455
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,570
there's a staggering amount of content

456
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,090
very little Abstergo stuff the Eagle of

457
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,490
the Eagle mechanic great loot though you

458
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,399
can't get attached to your loot graphics

459
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,110
exploration mode where you kind of

460
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,549
figure out things on your own

461
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,649
there are multiple endings in the game

462
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,600
and I appreciate when everytime you do

463
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,080
multiple and inspecting and so all these

464
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,970
really good things and it's just I don't

465
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,789
want to be soft to start fucking with

466
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,590
the game with these these things yeah

467
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,240
they're not that much of a problem now

468
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,340
some people don't mind grinding you know

469
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,200
like in Terra they MMO I didn't mind

470
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,179
grinding because the action in combat

471
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,940
was so good but if but I don't want to

472
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,039
be in an RPG or an action-adventure

473
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,630
where I'm on the mainline quest and I

474
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,610
hit a wall and I have to be like alright

475
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,960
I have to do this I don't want to feel

476
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,549
forced to do something that's no longer

477
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,490
optional that's that's forced alright so

478
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,679
and then finally we'll wrap it up a

479
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,740
little bit with the cons this is not

480
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,380
really Assassin's Creed no it's 400

481
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,059
years before Assassin's Guild even

482
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,840
existed yeah it was 400 years before

483
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,370
there are no assassins there are no

484
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,039
Templar no they are at Coldfoot

485
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,840
you got a Colt by the way did you like

486
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,730
the Colt mechanic it opened up towards

487
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,450
the the the further into the game I know

488
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,220
that was a great mechanic another pro

489
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,470
that I forgot where doesn't show you

490
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,090
exactly where they are they'll give you

491
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,620
like one or two but later but you have

492
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,320
to figure out Oh on this island he's

493
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,389
hiding in a cave and so you felt like an

494
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:01,350
investigator or you a lot of guys forced

495
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,909
you to do side quest to unlock where

496
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:07,470
they were and it was like okay or do a

497
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,929
go do a conquest battle or weaken this

498
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,320
area so the dude pops out yeah so it's

499
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,669
good good with the bad

500
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:18,059
what about the mercenaries mechanic Alex

501
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,309
did you like that mercenaries mechanic

502
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:22,889
it was fine I mean it's like a five-star

503
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,730
Grand Theft Auto thing yeah I mean it

504
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,169
wasn't something that I felt like

505
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,120
impacted the game to where I was gonna

506
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,919
like it more than what it was I just got

507
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,679
so tired of the side quests in the

508
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,240
beginning that I didn't like I said I

509
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,500
didn't finish the game I just got to the

510
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
point where it's like I don't have time

511
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,649
to do all this stuff I don't want to

512
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,409
deliver all of wood from this lady to

513
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,690
this guy or the Midwife needs something

514
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,940
and so she gets this I can't do it I

515
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,080
don't want to do any more I didn't sign

516
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,419
up for this yeah I know Jake $7.00 for

517
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,190
the game right see that's good that's

518
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,220
crazy and I paid 60 and I'm like no fuck

519
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,820
so tell you what uh the mercenaries to

520
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,649
the the thing that I want to bring up is

521
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,270
like they when they were like why don't

522
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,070
you have a shield in this game that was

523
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,179
one thing that bothered me they're like

524
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,130
mercenaries don't use shields and then

525
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,019
every other mercenary had fights coming

526
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,519
at me with a shield and spear and I'm

527
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,480
like oh that was a very weak excuse yeah

528
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,159
but I think that was done I don't mind

529
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,320
that there's no she shield because I

530
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,639
think it makes her combat a little

531
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,769
faster there was a shield in Origins yes

532
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,529
yes they just wanted to change up the

533
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,029
way combat worked it didn't bother me

534
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,529
too much but I can see how it could

535
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,759
bother I didn't like it late I got

536
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,830
really annoyed when I had four fucking

537
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,750
mercenaries on me I'm like goddamn the

538
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,250
only reason I like the mercenaries is

539
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,409
because every one so I find a cool one

540
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,179
and I'd knock him out and recruit him

541
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,309
for my ship that was the only reason why

542
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,799
I was excited about what is Shanghai oh

543
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,710
and they would drop loot for anybody

544
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,600
that's won during the final mercenary is

545
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,120
literally just a generic guy so don't

546
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,509
expect a crazy let's not try to do too

547
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:59,370
many spoilers but that's what bacon that

548
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,289
that was important it's just a challenge

549
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:06,600
important that sucks yeah they want you

550
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,259
to go down the coal path and and fight

551
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:12,269
like Alexio or Kasana depending on how

552
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:15,720
you play anyway so um so I said the cons

553
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,090
romance options doesn't really work the

554
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,850
AI isn't very smart I'm not it's it's

555
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,039
not that big of an issue because the

556
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,269
challenge comes from more of the

557
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,100
leveling you know the enemies are how

558
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,809
are they higher level they hit you once

559
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,970
you're fucking dead kind of thing to

560
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,360
hold that the game is level gated it was

561
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,190
it level gated in origins I never

562
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,190
finished so because you had the shield

563
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,379
you could block but you had a way better

564
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,679
tool so you could fight someone that was

565
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,750
three levels higher than you if you were

566
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,159
good but in this a lot of the time if

567
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,029
you get poisoned you die just so many

568
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,539
things and then finally there's almost

569
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,059
too much game here to a sentiment like

570
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,789
how but how Joe how could you say

571
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:03,690
something like that

572
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,029
well here's why is when you're playing

573
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,059
and and you get it feels tiresome you're

574
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,679
like I don't want to see it's the same

575
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,539
side question over and over there all

576
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,820
fetching it's like bring me this bring

577
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,260
me this go bring me this there wasn't

578
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,870
really any standout moments in the game

579
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,350
where

580
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,510
holy shit you remember that one mission

581
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,800
I mean there were a few with that

582
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,820
Spartan dude and in the that was fire

583
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,300
and he was in the warehouse yeah and but

584
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,700
even in that 300 battle right at the

585
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
beginning of the game I thought that was

586
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,730
a really weak representation after

587
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,500
watching 300 you're like well Lia nice

588
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,790
it's gonna be awesome and it was like

589
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,620
you didn't really know how to do combat

590
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,440
at that point so you were like something

591
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,960
like I'm just making every kill he does

592
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,680
like a cinematic I'm gonna be that cool

593
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,580
one day all right so let's go ahead and

594
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,750
do our final verdicts for the game I'm

595
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,910
gonna go ahead and start with Alex Suns

596
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,560
I think he put in the least amount of

597
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,780
time and said I'm out yeah I think this

598
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,640
one if we're going on the angry Joe

599
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,070
scale I think this one's probably

600
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,970
probably a six for me maybe seven no I'm

601
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,560
gonna go with seven yeah there it was it

602
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,540
was beautiful it was fun to play for a

603
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,090
time yeah I think with some tweaks I

604
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,920
mean if you if you really want to spend

605
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,590
66 five bucks I I got a review copy on

606
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,660
the console and then we purchased for

607
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,330
the PC and you also purchase for the PC

608
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,400
I can tell you right now do not buy any

609
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,890
of the limited editions collect the

610
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,200
collector's editions this or that season

611
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,260
pass all that stuff is unnecessary by

612
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,000
the the standard edition if you're going

613
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,760
to do what's yours

614
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,590
you gotta buy Totino's you have to buy

615
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,600
Totino's to get that weapon Joe where

616
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,560
Joe at Joe didn't play the game enough

617
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,360
so he weren't here otherwise he'd be

618
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,610
talking with us instead he was eating

619
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,010
them Totino's and i never wanted to use

620
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,780
the boost because i was like i need to

621
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,580
figure this out even though he bought it

622
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,130
at Walmart for the parody yeah so I read

623
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,340
origins and I found the things that I

624
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,500
thought were annoying got even worse in

625
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,260
Odyssey like origins I plowed through it

626
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,210
felt like okay I don't have to grind too

627
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,680
much I can just go straight through the

628
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,840
story which I did straight through and

629
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,760
with Odyssey I was still hitting walls

630
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,530
after walls and I honestly I'd know

631
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,940
exactly what you two are feeling like I

632
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,710
just felt the burn but I was like I got

633
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,060
to fucking do this I got to finish this

634
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,480
game

635
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,610
yeah and so like I'm at a

636
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,860
six I'm genuinely out of six just

637
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,840
because like let's see these are still

638
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
above average and we want to make that

639
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,440
it's not a great game it's not even a

640
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,450
good game it's an above average game and

641
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,340
it's brought it would be a good game if

642
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,200
they hadn't designed so much of their

643
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,929
game around spending yes there's no

644
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:50,370
reason for that to be there if that

645
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,410
wasn't there my rating would be 1/2

646
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,470
points higher transactions I would give

647
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,330
it a 7 or an 8 without a doubt but

648
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,309
because I do it higher worse it would be

649
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,070
like it's a something that I worry about

650
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,200
is like no company ever like gets up in

651
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,160
the morning it's like you know what I

652
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,370
want to make less money today right the

653
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,150
microtransaction stuffs not gonna go

654
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,380
away there hasn't been the blue right

655
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,059
once it gets into the game it is

656
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,490
impossible to take out and people

657
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,809
defending it really pissed me off

658
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,120
because I don't I don't want this shit

659
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,740
in our single-player games I don't think

660
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,630
it has any right to be there other than

661
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,090
is it grunt is it are they making it

662
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,380
more grinding now we're having to pay

663
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,640
attention to this level and if you're

664
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,350
defending it you're ruining your own

665
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,720
favorite franchise and I've had a lot of

666
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,520
people attack me over Odyssey maybe

667
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,410
because they love it so much and they

668
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,559
think it's one of the best I do too I am

669
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,419
more excited about Assassin's Creed I

670
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,610
love this move to RPG I love the this

671
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,790
Sparta stuff I'm more excited than I

672
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,950
ever been since Black Flag but - it's

673
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,809
dead but it got ruined a little bit yeah

674
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:55,770
so I'm I am at a 7 out of 10 and that is

675
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,750
with a heavy heart because I do think

676
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,510
this game is capable of a not an 8 or a

677
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,559
9

678
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,440
it could easily reach 9 and even 10 if

679
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,910
the story was better there were more

680
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,700
memorable battles but there's just so

681
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,040
much content here that it's really hard

682
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,950
to give it anything less you definitely

683
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,380
get your money's worth out of this game

684
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,450
in my opinion if it's one of those games

685
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,070
that you pick up from time to time once

686
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,049
you get tiresome once once it gets tired

687
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,790
throw it away play something else and

688
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,710
pick it up later on because it's always

689
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,940
gonna be there and there's always gonna

690
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,309
be new content and I am still not done

691
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,080
with the game I'll be upfront I did not

692
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,780
finish I did not go to level 40 50 I

693
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,429
didn't do all the mythic beasts or

694
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,860
anything like that so I'm just giving

695
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,750
you from my limited experience that's

696
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,919
why we're doing kind of a different

697
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,980
style with this one but because we are

698
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,940
doing a different style

699
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,230
let me also

700
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,809
to kick it to you guys with the future

701
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,090
of Assassin's Creed which Assassin's

702
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,710
Creed would you like to see next

703
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,140
Black Flag yeah do you want you want to

704
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,510
go back to pirates pirates dude like

705
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,669
that was their best game and then you

706
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,140
know we've said it every time they've

707
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,370
come out with another one when they came

708
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,809
out with like unity and all the other

709
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,760
ones and everything after we already did

710
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,230
Pirates so how would they do different

711
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,460
but every time we're like we need

712
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,559
pirates again and everyone even on the

713
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,000
comments and the Internet's like bring

714
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,250
back back Black Flag and it's like so

715
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,690
okay how would they do it different

716
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,100
you'd do something like you find out

717
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,110
Blackbeard was an assassin or saw a

718
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,760
Templar or something like that and you

719
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,350
just do a different time and and

720
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,059
incorporate all these are key elements

721
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,299
and and the improvements that may

722
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,320
because they've already just shown they

723
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
don't care about the whole mythical

724
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,410
thing they've just tied it into the ISO

725
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,410
or whatever the heck all right and then

726
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,850
Alex wouldn't thinkin are you also

727
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,950
pirates or there's another time period

728
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,780
you could pick I mean they could pick

729
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,160
different time periods but I know that

730
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,570
the pirate battles worked really well I

731
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,350
loved like we don't want to lose the sea

732
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,910
battles now that we got the sea battles

733
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,309
we don't lose that alright so here's my

734
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:50,910
idea

735
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,309
so pirates and you also support the idea

736
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:54,929
of pirates and then I'll give you other

737
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:57,059
Joe's idea too because he gave it to me

738
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,700
earlier so I think Japan now at first I

739
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,900
was like I want you pain I want Japan

740
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,490
please give me Japan even before this

741
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,990
game came out and then when I saw

742
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,820
Sonic's ps4 is gonna do it better with

743
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,860
ghosts I was like alright we don't need

744
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,600
Japan but after playing this Odyssey I

745
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,630
was like I want Japan why because Japan

746
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,340
island hopping you get the sea battles

747
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,740
still there you and and I will and this

748
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,179
gives them a chance to do the things

749
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,440
that in this game that were weak

750
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,260
companions add companions to Assassin's

751
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,390
Creed you could get the romance options

752
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,910
to actually mean something and and not

753
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,640
be so fucking cheesy and and bad because

754
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,530
you get to know them over the course and

755
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,419
there's an actual relationship building

756
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,910
you could even put in kingdom building

757
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,200
like a meta game cuz you're like a

758
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,490
Shogun and you're trying to conquer

759
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,679
areas and instead of the conquest

760
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,090
battles where it really doesn't matter

761
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,919
if it's part or athens it's just gonna

762
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,990
flipping back and forth no it matters

763
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,850
for you you're building your fucking

764
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,500
Shogunate you know it's a simulation

765
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,900
anyway bucket and then remove the

766
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,640
fucking microtransaction remove those

767
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,559
whole screen to buy this and buy that

768
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,540
and all this there that doesn't mean to

769
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,429
be in the game that one's not happening

770
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:00,000
but

771
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,890
the others happen I mean if they wanted

772
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,990
to go deeper into microtransactions you

773
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,190
could do not necessary just do way more

774
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,440
cosmetic ones yeah and I'd be fine if

775
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,420
people want to look exactly like those

776
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,040
other cosmetics where you can make your

777
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,780
crew look all badass you can make your

778
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,030
ship look badass I support those so as

779
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,830
long as there are already cosmetic

780
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,540
options there and then here's some more

781
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,280
cosmetic options that are premium or

782
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,080
whatever fine whatever

783
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,700
that's a concession to those people

784
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,500
would be good of equal money because

785
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,180
games are expensive these days why do

786
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,620
you think they're doing pre-orders why

787
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,610
do you think they're doing seasonpass

788
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,260
why do you think Totino's is doing this

789
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,640
and that and they're getting money from

790
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,110
all these fucking things and you want

791
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,240
them to even fuck up our balancing and

792
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,470
singleplayer fuck off

793
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,180
all right here's other Joe's idea which

794
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,850
is one of my favorites and I think we

795
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,280
should do it it'll never happen we're

796
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,380
going way back in time right we don't

797
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,120
even care that there's no assassins or

798
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,280
Templars Joe wants dinosaurs don't want

799
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,020
Assassin's Creed primal why are you

800
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,060
fucking climbing dinosaurs and cavemen

801
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:09,030
and dinosaurs and Assassin's Creed

802
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,010
there'd be no fucking cities and that

803
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,560
would suck but it would be pretty

804
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,960
entertaining if only to laugh at all

805
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,850
right guys so that's our review thank

806
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,430
you so much for watching thank you for

807
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,020
you know allowing this awkward format

808
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,210
version of it we're going to go back to

809
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,600
normal

810
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,070
angry reviews don't worry about that

811
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,630
it's just there's so many games in

812
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,540
October I had to do this because and and

813
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,100
I'm sorry about the parody that fucked

814
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,260
up like we wanted to use all Fortuner

815
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,240
but we our whole video got claimed and

816
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:45,390
so it was supposed to sound like this

817
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,650
[Applause]

818
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,930
but I can't play that much of it so

819
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,550
that's how it was supposed to sound
