1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,000
and every time I think about it go to

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,190
school also the premise of Pixar's Up

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,719
was surprisingly inspired by the stream

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,549
works logo in a Shrek movie once upon a

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,850
time in a kingdom far far away

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,439
once upon a time please Sharon her

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,080
reading until the Sun went down and they

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,820
saw that their daughter was cursed with

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,220
a frightful enchantment Prince Charming

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,630
got the revised copy of the story Shrek

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,740
was reading in the outhouse at the

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,150
beginning of the last film because this

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,830
is the exact same story only with extra

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,899
details they sought the help of a fairy

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,360
godmother who had them lock the young

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,790
princess away in a tower there to await

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,670
the kiss of the handsome prince charming

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,050
Eden for a fairy tale this sounds like

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,820
the worst plan ever instead of simply

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,840
keeping the princess somewhere close

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,309
fairy godmother and her parents decide

22
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,140
to put Fiona in some remote castle with

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,149
a fucking dragon travelling for many

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,789
days and nights risking life and limb to

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,730
reach the Dragons this is just me or is

26
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,020
it creepy that the Prince traveled all

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,640
this way just to get it on with a woman

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,020
he doesn't even know even though he's on

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,520
a mission I mean I don't we're a long

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,750
way from tinder but this is pretty

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,030
fucking desperate what why the fuck is

32
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,530
this asshole living this far away in the

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,210
castle wasn't there a happy ending in

34
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,439
Shrek where all the animals could live

35
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,100
in the forest again

36
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,530
also nice pork Illustrated joke but this

37
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,939
is taking a lot of ham to a sexual

38
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,619
extreme that I didn't know existed until

39
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,869
I saw it in this kids movie also also I

40
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,220
know prince charming is self-absorbed

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,810
and this journey is super long but how

42
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,490
did he not hear about Fiona's marriage

43
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,229
to Shrek I mean not one asshole told

44
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,369
this guy about the ogre who married the

45
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,990
princess back in whatever time this is

46
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,369
eight millimeter cameras existed

47
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,770
probably Nicholas Cage too maybe I'm in

48
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,619
love think about it every time I think

49
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,180
about it sure it's not as objectionable

50
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,100
as Smash Mouth song star but Counting

51
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,659
Crows is the best you can do movie its

52
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,759
2004 was actually Simpson not available

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,409
this image conjures up way more scarce

54
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,430
than I think is intended

55
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,020
Hansel loved Hansel and Gretel Fame

56
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,640
opened up a gingerbread house for

57
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,649
romantic getaway as in the place where

58
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,090
Hansel and Gretel nearly got eaten by a

59
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,740
witch and you're telling me after this

60
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,210
incident that he experienced with his

61
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,040
sister he said man and I would be a

62
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,630
great place for a honeymoon on a Turner

63
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,950
and

64
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,150
was Little Red Riding Hood doing in a

65
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,770
honeymoon hideaway anyway does she have

66
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,060
an arrangement with one of the couples

67
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,709
and knocked on the wrong door does she

68
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,030
think her grandma married the woodsman

69
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,530
Mike Myers inadvertently invents a new

70
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,690
category on pornhub called Oguri how did

71
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,550
the ocean pull off this trick and why

72
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,930
did this mermaid harlot start

73
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,340
immediately kissing trekt when she was

74
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,020
thrown into it and does feel I really

75
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,030
think I mermaid wanted to Trek I'm so

76
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,720
confused

77
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,190
movie goes a long way to make a Lord of

78
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,270
the Rings reference with no pay off

79
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,010
there are still assholes trying to kill

80
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,150
Shrek and Fiona even after the

81
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:35,200
revelations in the last movie movie is

82
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,610
unable to hold in a fart joke for more

83
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,440
than five minutes with a moon this big

84
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,970
total eclipses should occur way more

85
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,290
frequently and last longer than two

86
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,700
minutes we're supposed to believe these

87
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,260
trumpet players walked the entire way

88
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,030
from far far away to shrek swamp a

89
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,650
distance that will be nauseatingly

90
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,330
recreated in the next scene the king

91
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,660
will bestow his royal blessing upon you

92
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,459
and your prince charming why would this

93
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,410
dude continue this message in the first

94
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,820
movie everyone was freaked out by ogres

95
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,260
and in this one they're still getting

96
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,000
chased by pitchfork wielding villagers

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
don't you think they might be a bit

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,940
shocked to see you like this why would

99
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,350
they how did nobody hear about the

100
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,910
wedding in the last movie you know the

101
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,500
wedding where some sort of magical pixie

102
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,450
fairy dust change Fiona into an ogre

103
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,160
forever even in these times the news

104
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,870
would have spread faster than this but

105
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,090
they're my parents Shrek they love me

106
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,190
they love you so much they put you in a

107
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,810
fucking castle thousands of miles away

108
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,850
guarded by a dragon and only by the

109
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,470
luckiest of circumstances could you ever

110
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,209
be turn they just want to give you their

111
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,489
blessing now I need their blessing

112
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,350
laughs Jesus what was the point of the

113
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,910
first movie of tricks just gonna reboot

114
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,890
to being a sandy butthole so he can

115
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,780
learn to open up again we are not going

116
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,290
and that's final

117
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,519
good to see that this joke was still

118
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,950
very old back in 2004 the big bad wolf

119
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,480
can just appear wherever he wants even

120
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,709
though he was a thousand miles away the

121
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,680
last time we saw him this song

122
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,900
originally titled off was written by

123
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,700
Nile Rodgers after being denied entrance

124
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,160
to studio 54 and Mike Byers played Steve

125
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,930
rebelled in the movie about studio 54

126
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,850
all this to say this is the only

127
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,989
interesting pop-culture reference in

128
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,790
this movie and I'm 99% certain it was

129
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,360
unintentional

130
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,340
oh yeah it's easy for me to say this

131
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,410
goes on for some time because this are

132
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,950
we there yet

133
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,740
goes on forever so because it's an over

134
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,299
long joke wrapped loosely by a cliche

135
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,459
i'ma add five cents also if I didn't

136
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,630
live through it you would have never

137
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,070
convinced me that this movie made nearly

138
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,990
a billion dollars worldwide and was once

139
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,850
the third highest-grossing film of all

140
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,180
time

141
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,130
agony no in-flight movie and nothing I

142
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,540
would like donkey to explain where in

143
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,200
this world

144
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,040
flight movies and in-flight movies exist

145
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,240
seriously this movie is freaking 82

146
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,590
minutes without counting the credits I

147
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,419
convinced the initial cut was 23 before

148
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,100
they started out and like this the

149
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,810
kingdom of far far away has a burger

150
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,700
prince but it's tucked away behind a

151
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,050
whole bunch of other shops someone

152
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,250
forgot to tell these assholes about the

153
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,870
importance of location location location

154
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,370
apparently Rapunzel and Cinderella live

155
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,110
in the same goddamn place who's the

156
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,750
princess in this town anyway seriously

157
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,580
this news has never made it here and I

158
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,110
know it's far far away but give me a

159
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,690
fucking break you know the one that

160
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,370
changed into an ogre every night and we

161
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,870
sent to a castle thousands of miles away

162
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,120
yeah I guess that's easy to forget they

163
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,530
were so certain that Fiona had married

164
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,030
Prince Charming and broke the curse how

165
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,380
do they send the proper invite to shrek

166
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,390
swamp I suppose that would be a fine

167
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,440
place to raise the children listen if

168
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,550
the movie continues to pad its runtime

169
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,440
with overlong silliness like this I will

170
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,570
continue to send that it's great okay

171
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,120
well for his type yes this movie could

172
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,010
have been some really subversive Fiona

173
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,270
had stayed a human princess

174
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,620
perhaps a fun take on guess who's coming

175
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,720
to dinner but it sold out this couple in

176
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,490
order to make more fart jokes was this

177
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,410
dinner with a full Turkey a lobster a

178
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,970
giant fish and a pig really meant for

179
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,320
four people even if two of them are

180
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,270
ogres but gone home for anachronism I

181
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,490
voted for anachronisms back in 2000 56

182
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,010
this movie is going too far let's go

183
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,550
Kyle

184
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,930
why does fairy godmother need a flying

185
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,250
carriage to get where she's going and

186
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,050
didn't she show up - Fiona's balcony

187
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,360
riding a bubble from space nothing just

188
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,940
the old Crusades wound playing up a bit

189
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,919
Shrek franchise continues its pattern of

190
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,240
allowing people within earshot to hear

191
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,039
conversations only if it's convenient to

192
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:06,490
the plot

193
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,080
also this is a fairy tale set in a

194
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,729
completely different universe but the

195
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,680
Crusades also happened in their world Oh

196
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,729
what's you you remember my son Prince

197
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:18,760
Charming Charlie only Prince Charming is

198
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,800
fairy godmothers son how the fuck did

199
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,289
they piss up after I enjoyed blistering

200
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,350
winds

201
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,620
King desert mummy can handle this he and

202
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,870
yours blistering winds and scorching

203
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,270
desert this movie in a nutshell do

204
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,620
something then have somebody repeat that

205
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,240
something then fart or have donkey do

206
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,250
something annoying some gender-confused

207
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,320
wolf that's two thousand forest I mean

208
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,570
it wasn't my fault he didn't get there

209
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,980
in toss how long did it take Prince

210
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,690
Charming to go on this journey I mean in

211
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,100
the first movie Shrek was reading a book

212
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,080
about Fiona a time to go to farquaad's

213
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,790
castle then went all the way back to

214
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,260
where fiona was locked up brought her

215
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,760
back married her and went on a honeymoon

216
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,500
before Prince Charming got close to

217
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,970
saving her Herald you forced me to do

218
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,000
something I really don't want to do hmm

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,860
oh this is a setup - fairy godmother

220
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,150
going off her diet to eat at some

221
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,830
fast-food restaurant but clearly her

222
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,270
hired muscle thought it was time to beat

223
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,830
up the king here the director said let's

224
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,540
make this tavern sign a bite out of an

225
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,100
apple it'll make it look like even more

226
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:20,660
of an asshole man they dragged poor Tom

227
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,100
Waits into this didn't they did they

228
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,930
hear that there's only one fella can

229
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,670
handle a job like that where could I

230
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,500
find him I know the king has a personal

231
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,850
stake and getting Fiona together with

232
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,410
Prince Charming why is he doing all this

233
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,390
himself he's the fucking king doesn't he

234
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,950
get a mountain that can handle this why

235
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,270
- Shrek wears socks when he goes to bed

236
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,930
isn't used to being in a small barefoot

237
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,360
[Music]

238
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,160
heels are on the soundtrack quality

239
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,450
ratio of the music to the movie is

240
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,520
approaching Purple Rain status even

241
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,140
though her alter ego is an ogre looking

242
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,580
being Fiona's parents bought her a

243
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,530
terrifying ogre toy when she was a kid

244
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,360
Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber

245
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,280
party tomorrow that's a good joke but

246
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,750
what she really called Sleeping Beauty

247
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,160
when she was a kid and do all the fairy

248
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,570
tale princesses live in the same era I

249
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,700
just really need to make things work

250
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,860
with this guy but what you really need

251
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,480
to be doing is making that Scottish

252
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,260
accent reappear really starting to think

253
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,280
that the script for this movie was like

254
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,020
13 original lines and the rest was just

255
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,820
references to other better movies Mike

256
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,170
Myers character gets hit in the balls

257
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,350
example 392 also movie confirms the fact

258
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,970
that augers have testicles in the same

259
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,410
place as human which is a question I

260
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,270
didn't realize I had with the Mike Myers

261
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,890
connection you're just the cat and a hat

262
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,300
to me what do you reckon we should do

263
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,310
with him I see we take the sword neuter

264
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,030
him right here

265
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,560
give him the Bob Barker treatment I

266
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,669
truly want to know what kind of life

267
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,380
donkey lives where he knows about stuff

268
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,270
like inflight movies Shirley Bassey and

269
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,250
Bob Barker if the world these assholes

270
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,900
live in is one by which they have to

271
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,280
ride a horse-drawn carriage to go

272
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
somewhere then knowledge of Bob Barker

273
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,090
proves they're travelling stupidly are

274
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,460
you it was nothing Puss in Boots is

275
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,960
apparently such a badass that he's the

276
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,610
one guy with a reputation of being an

277
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,530
ogre killer he's defeated by Shrek

278
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,760
picking him up by the back of the

279
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,560
fucking neck dammit this movie's stupid

280
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,320
I just I just wish I could make her

281
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,910
happy we're supposed to feel sympathy

282
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,620
for Shrek here but all he's done in this

283
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,030
relationship is boss Fiona around

284
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,560
actively ignore what she's saying and

285
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,330
read her diary while she was sleeping so

286
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,950
I'm saying that sympathy until it's

287
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,930
actually earned think of the saddest

288
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,730
thing that's ever happened to you I

289
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,620
don't know maybe hard to find a copy of

290
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,150
The Adventures of Pluto Nash out here

291
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,040
Jesus Christ the logic in this movie

292
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,750
this is supposed to be Fiona's fairy

293
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,130
godmother you're saying she appears for

294
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,360
anyone that cries in the entire world

295
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,340
I'm either away from my desk or with a

296
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,080
client but if you come by the office

297
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,730
yeah all we need to do is show you a

298
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,110
picture of the office and you'll be able

299
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,290
to find it hard to believe that a fairy

300
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,550
godmother with this kind of power wasn't

301
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,170
able to just turn Fiona into an all-day

302
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,850
human with the soup a little bit of

303
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,140
magic charming would have married her

304
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,220
none of this would have happened

305
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,460
Cinderella lived happily ever after

306
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,290
yeah but in the last wreck which was

307
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,820
apparently only a couple of months ago

308
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,470
according to this movie Cinderella was

309
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,120
still available so how did this story

310
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,390
get written so fast

311
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,790
this fools anyone us do you think you

312
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,500
could get to those on top how to Shrek

313
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,940
no what any of these do let alone

314
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,710
whether the ones on the top work on his

315
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,750
particular problem don't stool softener

316
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,120
oh yeah you're right I'm sure a nice BM

317
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,560
is the perfect solution for marital

318
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,180
problem if the writers at these movies

319
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,620
had a say in it they would the guy with

320
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,940
the Hat has to grab his hat before the

321
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,560
door closes because Indiana Jones did it

322
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,330
that one time cliche these people are so

323
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,650
bad at shooting I'm shocked donkey

324
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,940
doesn't make a stormtrooper reference

325
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,670
shrek is a big lumbering ogre but

326
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,870
displays some crouching tiger-hidden

327
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,660
dragon moves out of nowhere he will rue

328
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,950
the day he stole my kingdom from me the

329
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,330
script of these movies have notes in the

330
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,740
margins that say when in doubt do

331
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,090
something involving gas or poop

332
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,230
remember your Georgia of the jungle

333
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,570
training man is don't feel right

334
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,070
donkey weights to object to this plan

335
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,690
until after they've gone to the factory

336
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,460
broken in stole the potion and made

337
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,430
their escape

338
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,029
I think you grabbed us how do you have a

339
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,680
proportion have I mentioned this movie

340
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,390
made nearly a billion dollars why does

341
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,100
the mushroom turn into a rose instantly

342
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,510
but Shrek and Donkey don't turn into

343
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,920
their hands themselves until later

344
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,480
give me an that they're bigger so it

345
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,190
takes longer but either this is a magic

346
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,100
potion god damn it maybe goes for that

347
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,690
sweet Sanford and sons nostalgia that

348
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,120
drove kids wild back in 2004 it was a

349
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,310
mistake to bring Shrek here I'm gonna go

350
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,930
out and find him and then we're gonna go

351
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,760
back to the swamp where we belong I

352
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,959
guess she made this decision while

353
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,279
thinking about her love for Shrek over

354
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,600
the course of the day even though she

355
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,040
hasn't seen him since their unresolved

356
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,870
argument last night and the only thing

357
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,370
she's discovered is that he abandoned

358
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,440
her after reading her diary I know it's

359
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
a happily ever after potion and Shrek

360
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,170
and Fiona 'he's love tied them together

361
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,820
over space and time like interstellar

362
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,860
and I'm completely fine with that but if

363
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,149
it requires two people in love to work

364
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,190
why would it turn a mushroom into a rose

365
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,050
and why wasn't the potion have some sort

366
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,940
of crossover effect between Shrek donkey

367
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,709
and the mushroom and if donkey changes

368
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,240
into a stallion why doesn't turn dragon

369
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,620
into a filly or Catherine the Great

370
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,149
taught round

371
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,709
buttocks I'm I'm gorgeous I'll say damn

372
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,360
these milkmaids are so horned up that

373
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,350
they'll hit on the first dude that

374
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,029
passes out in their barn to make the

375
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,920
effect of this potion permanent the

376
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,020
drinker must obtain his true love's keys

377
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,370
by midnight

378
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,870
what it should be potion if it has these

379
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,550
kind of rules I mean the potion affected

380
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,839
Fiona without her even drinking it

381
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,400
shouldn't that already be proof of true

382
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,779
love without a fucking kiss oh you poor

383
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,180
creature so we're talking animals common

384
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,010
in this world this assholes literally in

385
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,510
a horse-drawn carriage where the horses

386
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,339
are acting like regular horses but he

387
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,050
runs into a talking one and doesn't bat

388
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,279
an eyelash shrek knows exactly where

389
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,140
Fiona's room is and fiona came directly

390
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,940
from there so why wouldn't they just run

391
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,740
into each other also fairy godmother

392
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
somehow knew that Fiona would yell Shrek

393
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,650
would hear the scream and run after her

394
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,850
they'd miss each other running through

395
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,200
the castle and he'd come running into

396
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,940
this room allowing her to switch shrek

397
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,350
with Prince Charming before she can see

398
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,180
him also how did fairy godmother know

399
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,470
that Shrek would take the potion before

400
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,880
getting back to the castle setting up

401
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,630
these shenanigans

402
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,890
Shh you baby I could be Antonio Banderas

403
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,070
is the best thing about this movie

404
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,570
I fear it is me how in the everliving

405
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,550
Fionna and not know what Prince Charming

406
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,960
looks like it's not like fairy godmother

407
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,640
kept him hidden all these years hoping

408
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,140
she'd be able to do this switcheroo and

409
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,090
she wrote all about him in her diary if

410
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,240
you really love her you'll let her go

411
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,250
wait she fucking let him go I mean he

412
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,390
could have said anything to get out of

413
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,890
the room then walked right back up to

414
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,930
Fiona and won her back right Jesus the

415
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,370
silly conflicts this movie throws in for

416
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,870
no reason or maddening you just and this

417
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,890
cover of Jeff Buckley's hallelujah

418
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,380
sounds Oh can't believe you're gonna

419
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,940
just walk away from the best thing that

420
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,870
ever happened to you

421
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,720
what choice do I have what you could

422
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,310
even tell Fiona about the mix-up and let

423
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,690
her decide crazy right yeah she's uh in

424
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,850
the back luckily for Shrek and crew the

425
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,500
King has unfinished business with fairy

426
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,030
godmother taking place in this seedy

427
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,620
tavern of all places so that they can

428
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,660
get vital plot details this goofy sign

429
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,240
says no skin no bones no service in an

430
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,860
earlier bar scene there were clearly a

431
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,420
couple of ents hanging out which have

432
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,070
neither if you're gonna do silly do it

433
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,650
consistently movie half Fiona drink this

434
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,300
and she'll fall in love with the first

435
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,160
man she kisses why didn't you just give

436
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,660
her this potion in the first place since

437
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,040
the other potion only works with true

438
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,900
love's kiss why did you even chance this

439
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,390
thank you mother

440
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,740
movie again abandons what could be an

441
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,450
exciting chase scene because we don't

442
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,370
have time for that but we do have time

443
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,290
for a big fart montage at the beginning

444
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,300
of the movie and Prince Shrek it oh my

445
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,220
movie saves animation time and resources

446
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,700
by using the actual Joan Rivers you mean

447
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,630
there's still kids

448
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,860
how does Hansel run a successful

449
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,510
gingerbread honeymoon hideout at this

450
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,060
age they might pass me a buffalo wing I

451
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,500
can believe in magic and monsters and

452
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,150
spells and potions but I refuse to

453
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,920
believe that this gingerbread man can

454
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,720
fully consume a chicken wing tonight

455
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,750
nice cop spoof that just happens to

456
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,890
feature Shrek and company getting

457
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,750
arrested shows up conveniently so that

458
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,400
these dicks can save Shrek not only is

459
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,050
this commercial that shows every aspect

460
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,640
of the arrest bulletin but the ability

461
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,470
of medieval TV producers to edit live

462
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,540
video for broadcast that night is total

463
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,850
nonsense too

464
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,199
wait Shrek and Donkey raced off from the

465
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,489
bar with fairy godmother in hot pursuit

466
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,339
who is you know magic so why and how did

467
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,660
the fucking village Knights need to get

468
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,689
involved that said no mine oh god damn

469
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,279
this movies never seen a cheap joke it

470
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,350
won't make be surprised how much I

471
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,959
change for your mother change he's

472
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,539
completely lost his mind let's back up a

473
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,489
second all we've seen is Fiona talking

474
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,439
to Prince Charming one time and yes

475
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:23,970
things were a little off but we haven't

476
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,439
seen any other interaction between these

477
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,789
two that would sell the fact that Prince

478
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:30,689
Charming makes a horrible Shrek how did

479
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,249
these guys find Shrek's exact prison

480
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:33,539
cell because it's also lucky that

481
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,039
there's a skylight in this thing - also

482
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,929
isn't this high up in the castle how did

483
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,129
they get all the way up here they blew

484
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:39,809
the top off the dungeon without anyone

485
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,459
hearing by the way but where did they

486
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,319
get the key to the shackles damn it

487
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,329
spend some time on some logic movie any

488
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:48,419
logic what shrek gets the totally insane

489
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,220
idea that the muffin man can build a

490
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,569
giant gingerbread man that will help

491
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:53,279
them storm the castle and it turns out

492
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,109
he's right by the way was there ever any

493
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:56,399
explanation as to how the gingerbread

494
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,479
man got his light back the movie doesn't

495
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,709
show is the giant gingerbread man

496
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,239
smashing up the four muffin man's house

497
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,220
after he agreed to this stupid plan yeah

498
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,779
I'm glad this movie didn't get made past

499
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,549
the year 2008 or else we would've had

500
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:09,959
DreamWorks looking for a gingerbread man

501
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,879
versus Pillsbury Doughboy franchise

502
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,409
throw in the Jolly Green Giant and

503
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:17,519
Mothra while you're at it forcible

504
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,109
frenching fairy godmother decides to

505
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:20,639
shoot some sort of spill that went to

506
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,919
the 300 school of slow motion ins wait a

507
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,389
minute if the spell the fairy godmother

508
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,619
shot towards Shrek bounced off the

509
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,209
king's armor then how did it change him

510
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:31,709
into a frog ah after potion midnight the

511
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,239
second that the clock hits midnight it's

512
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,979
midnight not after the bells chime

513
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:38,519
twelve times is this what you want to be

514
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,769
this way forever it's not so much what

515
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,629
she wants but what the studio and the

516
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,009
people paying to see Shrek movies want

517
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,019
as I see the exact same transformation

518
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,549
that I saw in the last movie I just had

519
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,049
a thought smoothy is no different from

520
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,559
the original

521
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,329
it's about Fiona accepting who shrek is

522
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:52,979
denying another prince a chance to marry

523
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,749
her and changing into an ogre in the end

524
00:16:54,749 --> 00:17:00,770
with a few extra characters sprinkled it

525
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,150
at this point the song had been out for

526
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,980
five fucking years and as fun as it is

527
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,570
everyone had heard it on the radio and

528
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,100
at a million weddings parties bar

529
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,320
mitzvahs and quinceañeras yet here comes

530
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,360
a dance montage to keep pouring salt on

531
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,220
her wounds haha you thought mid-credits

532
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,840
scenes were a marvel creation but

533
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,400
Shrek's the real culprit for this

534
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,290
cultural abomination great now I'm gonna

535
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,820
be thinking all day about how a donkey

536
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:31,020
gets his penis into a dragon vagina what

537
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,970

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,140
bed and spank her you must fight her

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,120
Donald's recycling permits we have

546

reports of an unidentified flying object

547

it is a long smooth shaft complete with

548
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,730
