brand-new origin PC computer I have no

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,230
idea what's inside it but based on the

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,150
gamer lights instead I could tell it's

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,820
pretty damn powerful I thought that look

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,890

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,380
computer ever made with this I can

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,380
finally destroy t-series but this is not

80
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,450
your family the American flag is

81
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,890
supposed to be flown higher than any

82
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,120
other country's flag here boy hi our

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
flags are flown according to the United

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,440
States code when flags of two or more

85
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,270
nations are displayed they are to be

86
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,190
flown from separate staffs of the same

87
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,989
height the flag should be approximately

88
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,810
equal size international usage forbids

89
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,580
the display of the flag of one nation

90
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,680
above of another nation in time

91
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,450
peace I have no idea what's that title

92
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,419
for like the United States clearly has a

93
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,729
code that shows the specific height at

94
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,440
which their flag should be shown in

95
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,620
comparison to other flags and IKEA

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,850
happen to be able to really off

97
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,039

98
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,650

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,820
today we celebrate his birthday by

102
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,340

110
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,229
already why I got banned for the movie

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,840
sub for comments like 200 up votes so

112
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,910
people liked it and agreed but the mod

113
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,570
banned it because what's a conservative

114
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:22,930

because you doing better than them not

149
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,900
sure what they get out of it but all you

150
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,660

152

the truth appreciate everyone Chris

153
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,320
sticks by us hey remember that time you

154
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:25,830
call me which is the most offensive the

155
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,800
most you just kind of spread positivity

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:44,170
you try to make it harder for my poor

157
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,630
hard way so when NASA first started

158
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,630
sending astronauts into space they

159
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,330
realized that the ballpoint pen would

160
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,040
not work at zero gravity a million

161
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,010
dollar investment in two years of test

162
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,380
result in a pen that could ride in space

163
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,270
upside down on almost any surface and at

164
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,340
temperatures ranging from below bottle

165
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,570
and when confronted with the same

166
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,870
problem the Russians used a pencil in

167
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,640
the early is a space like those Russians

168
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,200
and Americans use pencils in space and

169
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,370
fortunately pencil that is made of

170
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,780
graphite a highly conductive material

171
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,460
snap reflect light sand particles in

172
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,050
zero-gravity are hugely problematic as

173
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,920
they will get sucked into the air

174
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,390
ventilation or electronic equipment

175
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,950
easily causing shorts or fires and a few

176
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,810
oxygen environment of the capsule after

177
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,410
the phone

178
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,110
this is a radius thing ever I do think

179
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,390
it's interesting though yeah I love when

180
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,860
people just call that kind of thing out

181
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,740
NASA is not that stupid right it's

182
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,140
freaking NASA there's been several

183
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,090
studies that show that nASA has made way

184
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,620
more money than was invested into it

185
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,540
really things that have been invented

186
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,110
from it

187
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,510
baby formula came from NASA what's baby

188
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,570

197
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,740
highways there's no way NASA did that

198
