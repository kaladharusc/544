1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,139
you have officially crossed the line of

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,940
logo decency Hollywood also reads

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,769
position if this giant spaceship is

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,450
spinning to simulate gravity then why

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,920
are all the stars that can be seen out

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,570
this window completely stationary also

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,100
the CGI of this cockpit is just bad

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,180
enough for me to worry that I'm actually

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,949
watching Final Fantasy again boring

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,660
robotic text continues to give the

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,070
audience a tour of the ship even though

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,660
we'll get one with Chris Pratt in just a

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,670
second that will last 30 minutes also

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,199
also I would hope that this ship's

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,700
advanced technology that allows it to

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,380
conduct interstellar travel would also

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,090
allow it to detect an asteroid field and

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,800
navigate around it but it seems the ship

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,239
is designed to create an inciting

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,680
incident for the plot rather than get

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,030
its passengers safely to their final

22
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,559
destination it's a tactic the Avalon

23
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,450
learned from United Airlines so this

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,829
ship hits a giant iceberg err I mean

25
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,110
asteroid and one random pod hooks up and

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,850
decides to wake it's single inhabitant

27
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,289
90 years early you think these ponds

28
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,550
would be controlled together in some way

29
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,230
that would keep just one from going

30
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,760
rogue but if that were true this movie

31
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,289
would be more about how six mechanics

32
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,730
wiped out the Avalon's bar and

33
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,199
complained that the only humanoid robot

34
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,100
looks like Michael Sheen

35
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,210
it's okay James dammit Jim can we agree

36
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,920
that no other intergalactic traveler can

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,900
be named Jim also I can believe the

38
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,490
asteroid field causes a series of events

39
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,900
to occur by which Jim spawn was

40
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,369
activated early what I can't believe is

41
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,290
AI that is so amazing it can detect

42
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,729
you'd rather be called Jim than James

43
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,560
but still not know his pod open way too

44
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,650
early you're a passenger on the starship

45
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,600
Avalon seriously why does Jim have no

46
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,259
idea where he is

47
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,820
did someone knock him over the head on

48
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,290
his way to work put him in the starship

49
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,909
against his will you'll enjoy space

50
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,890
travel at its most luxurious that

51
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,570
asteroid hit also screwed up Jim's wake

52
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,860
up video given that he's a lowly

53
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,600
mechanic and only has access to the bare

54
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,009
minimum the ship has to offer these

55
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,390
little Roombas around cleaning even

56
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,829
though no one is set to wake up for 90

57
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,930
years you're adorable illuminate for you

58
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,759
is it so hard to tell him he's in room

59
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,710
268 I mean the illumination thing is

60
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,329
cool if you ever forget but tell him the

61
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,710
number for God's sake hunky lead

62
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,299
character is seen taking a shower with

63
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,259
the water hitting in the back of his

64
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,360
neck cliche so one passenger wakes up

65
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,590
and the entire ship kicks into gear

66
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,360
acting like everyone's awake because the

67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,740
ship is this is all these extremely

68
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,479
complex AI systems but doesn't have a

69
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,860
clock for it to know that someone is up

70
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,329
early nor does it have the intelligence

71
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,439
to wait for everyone to enter the

72
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,430
auditorium before starting a

73
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,840
presentation

74
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
prosperous planet the cradle of

75
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,050
civilization but for many it's also

76
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,099
overpopulated maybe this presentation is

77
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,510
continuing because it's more for us the

78
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,800
viewing audience then for learning group

79
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
38 where is everybody we are all on the

80
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,110
starship Avalon this hologram flight

81
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,370
attendant is answering Jim's question

82
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,140
even though he is directed to in the

83
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,239
wrong Tilian please the captain is

84
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,739
usually found on the bridge in the

85
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,540
command ring Jim rightly does not have

86
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,129
access to the bridge but somehow has

87
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,349
access to the command ring which access

88
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,140
requires special authorization so why

89
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,630
did the first door open at all then

90
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,269
reply in 55 years so if they are even

91
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:43,680
half way from Earth and it still takes

92
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,510
this long to transmit messages then how

93
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,500
would the Avalon be able to communicate

94
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,239
with anyone on earth once they all woke

95
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,890
up in ninety years all the information

96
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,690
would be extremely outdated that will be

97
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,819
six thousand twelve dollars proving that

98
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,319
sending messages from the Avalon is like

99
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,700
present-day Earthlings trying to use

100
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,980
gogo in-flight Wi-Fi I had looked past

101
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,450
the lights coming on when he walks into

102
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,890
a certain area but I after believing

103
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,480
that the humanoid bartender would be

104
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,739
fully functioning ninety years early

105
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,000
this seems like an appliance that would

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
be taken out of storage and assembled by

107
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,730
a crew member during the month before

108
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,410
all the passengers wake up please make a

109
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,859
selection sorry the mocha cappuccino

110
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,019
extreme is reserved for Gold Class

111
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,519
passengers if he's logging into this

112
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,660
thing with this bracelet then why

113
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,310
doesn't the computer show him only the

114
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,810
drinks to which he has access you mean

115
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,160
people have to play a guessing game to

116
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,239
figure out what coffee they can drink

117
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,920
even though Jim is just a passenger he

118
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,359
has access to the maintenance area can

119
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,130
open all these pods and take replacement

120
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,549
parts

121
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,109
Jim willingly jumps into a pod that

122
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,579
malfunctioned earlier and is closing the

123
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,900
door how does he know what's going to

124
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,430
work how do they know that it won't just

125
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,840
lock him in it does eventually let him

126
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
out but this movie is supporting footage

127
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,419
for what I just said would be excellent

128
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,750
at cinema since there isn't a fail-safe

129
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,400
on these paths to keep them from waking

130
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,810
up 90 years early but if you have one

131
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,310
hard enough from the inside it will open

132
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,019
right up since these pods never

133
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,459
malfunction it seems like this wouldn't

134
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,900
be available either it's clear to me now

135
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,950
that the ship is just going to

136
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,480
experience problem after problem until

137
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,709
Jim fixes everything with Jennifer

138
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,239
Lawrence not only saving themselves but

139
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,739
everyone on the ship will go ahead and

140
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,630
add a sin for predictability but this

141
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,769
makes me wonder if a whole bunch of

142
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,329
critical errors happen and there's no

143
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,590
one week to fix them what the ship just

144
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,450
explode and everyone would die why is

145
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,709
the no system for some hyper intelligent

146
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,599
robot like the one they made to serve

147
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
drinks to solve any problem that may

148
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
arise during the 120 years the ship is

149
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,790
in transit or at least have a way to

150
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,109
wake up a team of crew members that can

151
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:17,519
fix these issues and give them a way to

152
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,870
go back to sleep it's this level of

153
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,549
design hubris that sunk that

154
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,169
a cruise ship a hundred years ago what

155
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,460
was that thing called even though Jim

156
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,840
prized the door to this luxury suite

157
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,759
open with a crowbar the room comes on

158
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,990
normally and doesn't act like he just

159
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,759
broke in on top of that he has access to

160
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,960
the part of the ship where these luxury

161
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,030
suites are can order at the fancy sushi

162
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,830
bar and can play the dance-off game yet

163
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,629
he can't order a fancy coffee in the

164
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,280
cafeteria beginning to think Chris Pratt

165
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,599
loves dancing so much he's made it a

166
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,069
contractual obligation I'm just

167
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:42,300
realizing that the first third of this

168
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,740
movie is basically the pilot episode of

169
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,900
the last man on earth but in space not

170
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,430
only is Jim able to suddenly enjoy all

171
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,720
the amenities of the ship upon gaining

172
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,550
access to that room but he also found

173
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,020
that hilarious fake beard to wear I

174
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,610
sympathize with Jim not having human

175
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,080
contact but if he really wanted to

176
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,789
simulate that why not just give Arthur a

177
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,680
hook Jim has magical tears that can

178
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
still stream down his face even in

179
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,039
zero-gravity by the with this ship

180
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,330
allowed Jim to get in the airlock

181
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,430
without a suit I wanted Dave dead but

182
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,690
it's still at the courtesy to warn him

183
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,770
about entering the airlock without a

184
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,659
helmet Jennifer Lawrence plays or Lane

185
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:12,300
rejected names include Jane supernova

186
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,699
Celeste Morningstar and hotbody McNabb

187
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,639
debts searching passenger profiles space

188
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,740
books talking the first day of school at

189
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,539
this school bus took 120 years to get

190
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,270
there funny translation if you were hot

191
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,710
anything you say with good humor is

192
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,389
hilarious say you were trapped on a

193
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,550
desert island and you had the power to

194
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,440
wish somebody there with you why would

195
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,699
you tell this Android bartender the

196
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,560
story what function does it serve other

197
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,270
than for him to later tell Aurora that

198
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,219
Jim did this to her stranding her on

199
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:39,870
that ship for the rest of her life when

200
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,520
you come to that yep it's pretty simple

201
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,319
the decision is clear do the total wrong

202
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,300
thing and open her pods stranding her on

203
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,099
the ship forever or meet you needs

204
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,509
halfway and leave her alone where she

205
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,860
will wake up 90 years from now with

206
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,449
unexplained white stains on the glass

207
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,639
the ship has and Jim was able to find a

208
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,289
workshop that had some gym equipment in

209
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,909
it also this decision will require a

210
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,699
rocky montage

211
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,810
movie feels the need to have its main

212
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,310
character tell me what he's doing even

213
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,599
though I have the mental faculties to

214
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,979
see and understand what he's doing the

215
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,389
metaphor for what Jim is doing here is

216
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:07,440
something he wouldn't mention in polite

217
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,270
company I admit the decision makes sense

218
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,860
and I can't say that if I were in the

219
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,000
same position I wouldn't talk myself

220
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,560
into doing something like this movie

221
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,940
will go on to show that it was good that

222
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,379
he did this but can we not be so

223
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,300
results-oriented about the action before

224
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,560
we even know what happens this is pretty

225
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,330
goddamn wrong alternately what if this

226
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,039
movie was from her perspective this is a

227
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,360
horror movie where our fun-loving

228
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,860
protagonist with star-lord and Owen

229
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,599
Grady equity becomes the villain hard to

230
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:28,800
see him as anything else once you do

231
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,229
that there's the crew the crews in a

232
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,920
secure hibernation room

233
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,390
Jim doesn't answer this question until

234
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,680
they're all the way to the hibernation

235
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
room also why does the crew have to be

236
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,370
in a secure room the bridge and the

237
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,660
engine makes sense but what are they

238
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,680
worried about happening to the crew

239
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,210
while everyone is asleep seems like the

240
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,620
only thing this ship prepared for was

241
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,360
this love story between Aurora and Jim

242
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,460
I'll walk you to your cabin after all

243
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,960
there are a lot of ruffians about you

244
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,100
never know we might be lurking around

245
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,780
the corner and waking people out of

246
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,820
hyper sleep early don't tell her Arthur

247
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,010
by not simply lying to the robot and

248
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,870
saying Aurora's pod serendipitously

249
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,880
malfunction just the same as his Jim is

250
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,660
creating a liability for himself how can

251
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,160
there be no way to put someone back into

252
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,440
hibernation what if a pod breaks down no

253
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,270
hibernation pod is malfunctioned and

254
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,130
thousands of interstellar flights so

255
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,870
let's make sure we have no fail safes in

256
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,580
place in case the impossible happens

257
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,960
seriously it's pretty odd that a ship

258
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,730
full of futuristic technology and tons

259
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,470
of other fail-safes is so arrogant about

260
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,570
a top-ten concern also I just realized

261
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,460
this movie is Titanic and 2001 and

262
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,900
wall-e all rolled into one

263
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,090
also if each homestead voyage takes well

264
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,500
over a hundred years and they have done

265
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,270
thousands of flights to quote Palin

266
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,980
Parrish what year is it I guess he

267
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,270
forgot those times he went to the sushi

268
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,800
place when the Mexican restaurant in

269
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,450
order whatever he wanted why even go to

270
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,830
the cafeteria anymore when you have all

271
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,360
these great restaurants or do they have

272
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,010
business hours space travel is

273
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,180
lightyears ahead of where we are today

274
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,740
but Roomba technology has remained

275
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,090
mostly the same I've been awake for

276
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,950
seven days it's excellent that Aurora

277
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,540
favors speech-to-text as her way to

278
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,130
write it allows us to hear her thoughts

279
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,540
and gain an understanding of her mental

280
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,980
and emotional state but despite that

281
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,750
it's still narration and I just can't

282
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,670
help myself why did you do it Aurora

283
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,900
asked a question that nobody asks

284
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,310
without context so the gym will think it

285
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,780
means why did you open up my fucking pod

286
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,490
Jeep do you know how much homestead

287
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,610
company made off its first planet eight

288
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,230
quadrillion dollars they discovered a

289
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,880
planet that so closely resembled earth

290
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,080
to the point that Earthlings could

291
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,460
inhabit it what were the chances there

292
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,140
was no other life there or was this

293
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,610
colony planet discovered by Christopher

294
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,460
Columbus the sixteenth icy zeros on the

295
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,470
homestead company's bottom line for

296
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,820
someone so pessimistic about the

297
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,260
homestead company you'd think she didn't

298
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,550
buy a ticket to travel on one of their

299
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,670
planets chef accountant or midwife

300
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,320
she has to be a midwife there's no way

301
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,880
you didn't even without she's a midwife

302
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,520
we'd be friends Jim just said she's a

303
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,290
midwife right and Aurora is a famous

304
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,060
writer from New York with an even more

305
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,710
famous father let's be honest they would

306
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,180
never know each other you don't even

307
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,160
want to think about it anymore all right

308
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,780
I call time how long did it take her to

309
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,779
give up like two weeks who's the

310
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,740
lovely lady this is Aurora Aurora

311
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,670
special she's been up for a few weeks

312
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,810
and this is the first time she's meeting

313
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,350
Arthur

314
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,459
she couldn't have found him on her own

315
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,970
Jim ran into him on day one space the

316
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,100
one thing I do not need more of wifeless

317
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,410
laughter what about my dress yeah what

318
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,759
about her dress this really asks the

319
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,800
question what about his suit did he put

320
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,240
that thing on while wearing his suit or

321
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,009
did he undress in front of her ah the

322
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:09,420
mysteries of editing this scene would be

323
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,860
super romantic if it wasn't for that

324
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,240
thing he did it's at this point I

325
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,259
realized I'm watching a horror film

326
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,029
disguised as a romantic comedy disguised

327
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,069
as sci-fi so they started making out in

328
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:18,540
their space suits stopped to take off

329
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,430
their spacesuits Aurora found a robe on

330
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,660
the way back to their room and then they

331
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,189
started back up again the last two

332
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,540
people in the world who would ever get

333
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,370
together if I got together with Jennifer

334
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,990
Lawrence which I'm not opposed to that

335
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,519
statement may apply but Jim is an

336
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,290
attractive dude so you two getting

337
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,420
together is not that far-fetched

338
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,939
attention you may wish to proceed to a

339
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,129
viewing area considering that everyone

340
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,449
is supposed to be asleep right now why

341
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,589
would the ship make this announcement

342
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,329
but this happened if Jim and Aurora

343
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,860
didn't wake up is this announcement for

344
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,420
the robots I have too many questions

345
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,009
also why would a ship that has an engine

346
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:48,600
that works in space and can travel at

347
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,740
half the speed of light need to

348
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,569
slingshot around a star speaking of half

349
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:53,100
the speed of light are curious is a real

350
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,589
star that is 36.7 light-years away from

351
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,240
Earth and if they've been traveling for

352
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,709
about thirty years at half the speed of

353
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,750
light they would only be like 15 ish

354
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,459
light-years away from Earth unless the

355
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,809
Avalon's internal clock is just really

356
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,519
done which is totally possible and

357
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,750
they're 20 years further along than they

358
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,279
think they are there's no way they would

359
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,689
be able to slingshot around Arcturus

360
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:13,170
because they're nowhere near it these

361
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,519
robots have been programmed with French

362
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,500
accents I will be right back I have

363
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
nothing at all in particular to do I'm

364
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,410
just going to the bathroom to look at a

365
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,269
ring I already know I have I just need

366
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,470
to be out of the room when Arthur drops

367
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,759
a huge bomb on you about my pod

368
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,000
tampering activities do ya yes I woke

369
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,509
you up

370
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,279
creeper is revealed as a creeper and yet

371
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,569
that does not stop the movie in its

372
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,730
tracks as it should yes I woke you up

373
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,529
now imagine how powerful that would have

374
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,879
been if we didn't know about it there

375
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,290
was a way for this movie to do it but

376
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,699
then we would have hated a Chris Pratt

377
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,350
character instead of somehow feeling

378
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,179
sorry for him just saying I don't feel

379
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,470
sorry for him here even though the movie

380
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,929
is trying its very best this movie is a

381
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,429
classic case of when a mediocre script

382
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:48,389
happens two great actors

383
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,459
hey at least her Fitbit is still on and

384
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,839
functioning so she knows how many steps

385
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,189
she's taken since her space boyfriend

386
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,689
woke her up right movie spent so much

387
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,429
time on the boy gets girl boy loses girl

388
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,230
a part of this movie I almost forgot the

389
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,310
ship was falling apart

390
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,360
guess this movie is going to become a

391
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,339
sci-fi movie again for 20 minutes your

392
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,160
sweets control center is rebooting

393
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,749
I know it's deep into the movie now but

394
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,279
I got asked this question the ship is

395
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,689
taking these people to another planet

396
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:10,889
where they sleep for a hundred twenty

397
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,629
years during the trip so why did they

398
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,889
set up the ship with all the amenities

399
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:16,230
rec rooms cafeteria nice Suites and so

400
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,180
on wouldn't have just woken up went

401
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,769
through a quick recovery period and

402
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,779
deported or was the plan to wake them up

403
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,129
a year in advance let them enjoy the

404
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,389
ship then drop them off on another

405
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,920
planet because I don't see the reason

406
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,259
either way I hope you finally find

407
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,269
someone who fills your heart and I hope

408
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,800
best friend from 30 years ago in a video

409
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
message somehow says just the right

410
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,069
words to turn Aurora slowly back to the

411
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:40,529
direction of Jim copy please as Arthur

412
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:41,759
always served coffee and they've just

413
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,199
been going to the cafeteria for coffee

414
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,550
for no reason this is dead so this ship

415
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,899
which has experienced several power

416
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,790
malfunctions randomly awakens one more

417
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,379
person a crew member who can unlock

418
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,269
doors Jim couldn't access before because

419
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,800
this movie basically backed itself into

420
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,389
a corner story wise and needed some

421
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,309
serious Fishburne ex machina also it's

422
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:00,329
pretty insane with all the different

423
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,459
failures only two pods malfunction when

424
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,689
switch Byrne is here to indicate the

425
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,160
film has reinitiated sci-fi thriller

426
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,019
mode is something wrong with the ship

427
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,579
says the girl whose ex-boyfriend was

428
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,290
awakened 90 years early and was just

429
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,870
covered in cornflakes she knows she

430
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,759
knows how long you all a year still damn

431
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,990
I'm gonna remove a sin for Laurence

432
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,699
Fishburne saying what I feel you're

433
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,800
right Aurora but the drowning man will

434
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,269
always try and drag somebody down with

435
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,189
him so you see your aura you should shut

436
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:27,689
the hell up and just put yourself in gym

437
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,430
shoes for a change you selfish asshole

438
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,139
this guy gets revived so that just

439
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,850
before he dies Jim can take his keys and

440
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,660
be the hero of the movie

441
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,149
she's dead Jim so we're stranded on a

442
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,019
sinking ship

443
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,430
let's just hope this time there are

444
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,399
enough lifeboats 612 612

445
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,500
how does someone have 612 disorders this

446
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,970
guy apparently has every affliction ever

447
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,740
diagnosed on house and why isn't this

448
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,540
guy dead right now also I found another

449
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,980
problem with the ship the full-body

450
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,569
scanner is duplicating the disorders on

451
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,459
this list even after being slammed onto

452
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,509
the ground both Jim and Aurora

453
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,980
maintained the ability to run down to

454
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,629
engineering our heroes take time to

455
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,249
power down Arthur while he malfunctions

456
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:00,779
because that's super important right now

457
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,459
can't we wake up some of the crew

458
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,199
they'll take him too long to recover we

459
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,249
don't have that kind of time instead of

460
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,839
waking up crewmembers when Gus was still

461
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,819
alive Jim Aurora and Gus decided they

462
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,290
could fix the ship on their own and now

463
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,910
when they seriously need some help it's

464
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,200
too late to wake anyone up

465
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,850
this giant engineering room they find a

466
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,560
major problem in only the second place

467
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,630
they visit both Jim Nora have arms that

468
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,040
are stronger than the vacuum of space

469
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,710
it's the reactor control computer it

470
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,000
looks like this computer sustained a

471
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,380
fair amount of damage from that meteor

472
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,060
that hit two years ago but after the

473
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,740
meteor hit all the ship errors went away

474
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,480
except for the one on Jim spot is that

475
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,650
because it was the only error that was

476
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,940
important to the plot at the time as

477
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,680
replacement parts for everything and

478
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,940
there are replacement of hibernation

479
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,380
pods outer door non-responsive oh so

480
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,330
it's unresponsive that seems like plain

481
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,740
simple language that an accomplished

482
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,420
writer should understand I open the door

483
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,300
I get clear you blow that fire into

484
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,100
space so you see the movie engineered

485
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,630
our finale by which two people needed to

486
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,770
be awake to save the ship

487
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,360
this means it was a good thing that Jim

488
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,310
opened Aurora's pond because no one else

489
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,110
would have woken up and Gus Mancuso

490
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,850
would have died before he could help so

491
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,110
the movie is now saying Jim's actions

492
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,870
were justified because of this ending

493
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,520
without you I guess almond knocking

494
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,690
around she's been experiencing lately

495
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,250
caused her to forget that Jim woke her

496
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,720
up dooming her to a life of isolation

497
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,280
and space death because he thought she

498
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,290
was hot so touching the metal lever to

499
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,820
open the hatch burns like hell but

500
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,960
touching the metal counter where the

501
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,520
lever lives doesn't burn it all got

502
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,530
small heat shield allows Jim to survive

503
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,200
this Jim survives this also wait was the

504
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,310
engine off during that whole sequence

505
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,350
how was there gravity inside the ship I

506
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,760
started to think gravity has different

507
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,260
more random properties in this corner of

508
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,040
deep space that's probably true but in a

509
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,600
much more transactional way than he

510
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
probably means here he's dead Jim

511
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,120
wait patient is dead I'm no computer

512
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
doctor but I don't think you can

513
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,520
resuscitate a dead person

514
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,170
post mortem operations require

515
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,300
authorized medical supervision Jim is

516
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,800
dead and could be revived but poor

517
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,750
Mancuso had to die because of his 612

518
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,680
disorders there's no way he remembered

519
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,570
Mancuso's ID number also even though

520
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,740
these computers know who everyone is

521
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,210
they decide that Aurora's the type of

522
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,470
person who looks like Morpheus and

523
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,430
allowed the override

524
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,260
well she resuscitated a dead person

525
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,020
thank you be still why did you revive

526
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,610
him first instead of painting him then

527
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,710
reviving it there's anyone out attack

528
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,200
why there were over 5,000 people on this

529
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,520
ship and they don't have a second auto

530
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,380
doc wouldn't a better reason be someone

531
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,700
has to be outside to initiate it and

532
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,320
from this day forward Aurora I never

533
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,250
thought about the fact that Jim

534
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,720
condemned her to a life where she would

535
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,280
never see another human face and never

536
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,720
breathe fresh air again even though we

537
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,130
can see the planet the Avalon's engines

538
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,330
are still running which leads me to

539
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,650
believe that the ship might just fly

540
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,850
right past homestead

541
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,410
- if someone doesn't wake up and put on

542
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,549
the brakes and if they're close enough

543
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,199
to the planet to see it this size then

544
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,999
why is the crew just now waking up also

545
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,009
why did they hire Andy Garcia to show up

546
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,329
at the end is the captain for two

547
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:38,249
seconds how much did that cost

548
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,749
all of this foliage was able to flourish

549
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:49,379
for 88 years without a nearby Sun I'm

550
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,949
just gonna bash your brains

551
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,479
Kevin's log stardate twenty to fifty

552
00:15:54,479 --> 00:16:04,139
nine point 55 guess I am gonna die of

553
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:13,079
old age on the ship just know that I

554
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,089
will never forget you to help you

555
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,100
recover from hibernation be sure to

556
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,769
drink plenty of fluids I can no longer

557
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,319
sit back and allow the International

558
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:25,169
communist conspiracy to SAP and in

559
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,839
purified I love our precious bodily

560
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,689
fluids this is Tom he worked in the coal

561
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,879
mine till they closed the town huh it's

562
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,559
Alice came over here from Milan when she

563
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,879
was a baby she lived in an earring most

564
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,899
of her life huh

565
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,970
in the end see she works in the dress

566
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,529
shop makes noises like a chip look when

567
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,239
she gets real excited did you know that

568
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,859
the original name for pac-man was puck

569
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:45,839
back yeah do you think it was because he

570
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,279
looks like a hockey puck but it actually

571
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,479
comes from the Japanese prints of

572
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,339
Hatfield Haku which means to flash once

573
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,230
past opening closed

574
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,499
