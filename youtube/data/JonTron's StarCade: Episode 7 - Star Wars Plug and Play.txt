1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:15,960
this is a Millennium Falcon with games

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,340
on it I got one thing to tell you about

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,590
that just take out my money y'all got

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,320
this soon up jacks Pacific a company

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,760
well known for making these plug and

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,800
play games also produced merchandise for

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,449
Star Wars it makes sense given how

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,820
popular these were I never understood

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,620
who these were truly meant to appeal to

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,870
people who didn't know better this came

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,079
out in 2006 and the graphics looked pre

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,180
Super Nintendo what you're looking at

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,460
here is literally from the same year as

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,520
Gears of War think about that hmm you

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,320
guys couldn't fit a few more instruments

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,989
in there sounding a bit sparse perhaps

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,910
the console was too small I mean to be

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,989
honest I don't know how you'd fit more

19
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,460
than one trumpet in here let alone one

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,739
first up is lightsaber duel

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,710
oh no high scores will you tell me

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,150
people weren't fighting over this thing

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,100
like the olden samurai trying to be

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,600
number one hold for what kind of thing

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640
exactly fighting your friends I don't

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,960
understand why is this the default

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,479
obi-wan and Luke is the first fight hey

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,830
guys you want to wait to beat this out

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,330
till after you defeat the Empire they're

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,619
still flying around on the background

31
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,070
free as Birds when you eventually do get

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,330
to fight Vader he just breathes

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,479
nonchalantly over your fight oh come on

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,500
dude don't fight dirty

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,410
next up Battle of Endor

36
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,060
hey where's that battle at I just see a

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,650
bunch of people crashing headlong into

38
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,720
trees is it the battle against drunk

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,440
driving

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,910
perhaps the battle is in the distance

41
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,950
and we're driving to it mmm let's see

42
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,810
here

43
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,540
that's much better this game is actually

44
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,460
reminiscent of another pre-existing game

45
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,440
Return of the Jedi arcade from back in

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,740
the 80s we are now a partner pipe

47
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,360
Threepio you're just gonna come out and

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,119
say that eventually you get to a part

49
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,650
where you're in a TST walking around

50
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,780
shooting everyone it's pretty great

51
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,460
because no one else stands a chance and

52
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,440
winning is fun the third stage is just

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,630
Falcons stuff pretty standard next on

54
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,840
the list assault on hot well this seems

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,010
like a lot of work to give the one guy

56
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,660
I'd be pretty stressed out if I were him

57
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,640
like they couldn't spare one more guy I

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
guess that Alliance paid free tuition is

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,030
looking a lot less attracted by the

60
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,070
minute a buddy occasionally a guy flies

61
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,170
by and drops off the coin the coin is

62
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,730
great and all but I would have preferred

63
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,050
a little help holding off the onslaught

64
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,870
of my inevitable doom hello how you know

65
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,970
and here's this see it and lastly

66
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,560
is red leader which is just a standard

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,670
shoot-'em-up there also exists prequel

68
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,870
versions of these games that came in

69
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,180
three stylings Darth Vader r2d2 and

70
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,920
general grievous these three all have

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,270
the same games on them just different

72
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,090
casings some rarer than others first up

73
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,600
is Khorasan - tech yeah okay I'm seeing

74
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,090
attack not so sure about chorus son

75
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,010
this game kind of reminds me of the 1982

76
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,260
arcade games CineStar if any of you even

77
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:09,790
know what that is

78
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:17,230
Genest are always freaked me out

79
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,870
I tell you what if you threw in a giant

80
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,610
Darth Vader had the chase doin yelled

81
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,440
catchphrases you'd have yourself a

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,380
bonafide winner here there's droid

83
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,750
invasion which is basically some weird

84
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,030
version of Arkanoid thrilling and

85
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,380
gunship battle which is basically just

86
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,890
nothing just nothing at all basically I

87
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,030
don't even know how this ship stays in

88
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,070
the air oh and excuse me how could I

89
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,400
forget

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,850
T'Pau chase the only chase that's gonna

91
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,560
be happening here is the one from my

92
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,160
money back yeah okay what alright that's

93
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,990
enough of that now this one has five

94
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,030
games instead of four the last one being

95
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,330
grievous onslaught it's okay I think

96
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,250
you're going around as Anakin just

97
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,200
slashing droids left and right I assume

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,370
you're here to save Chancellor Palpatine

99
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,320
like in the film it's funny whenever

100
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,820
you're about to save the Chancellor you

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,730
get sucked into the floor okay now on to

102
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,930
the ones with the peripherals

103
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,480
this one's called lightsaber or battle

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,130
game how long do you think it took him

105
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,930
to come up with that the way it works is

106
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,490
this training droid here I guess has

107
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,350
infrared sensors or something in it so

108
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,240
you just haphazardly put it on top of

109
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,710
something and use the saber to play the

110
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,770
game now where is that thing

111
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,650
this thing is so stubby I think it might

112
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,530
have been packaged for the wrong purpose

113
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,070
you know what I mean oh you know what I

114
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,610
mean

115
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,680
x-wing docking right this way mr.

116
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,490
Skywalker sir whoa this is amazing I've

117
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,960
always wanted to input my name with a

118
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,940
lightsaber or wait hold on I think I

119
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,700
actually have done that in the past

120
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,290
you mind now it's over no take-backs

121
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,270
right off the bat once again your

122
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,160
training against obi-wan now listen

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,169
closely the tactic you use here is very

124
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:12,970
advanced what you do is you wait for the

125
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,169
poor man's Parkinson's to

126
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,910
all-encompassing Li overwhelm him at

127
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,290
which point you whack him as hard as you

128
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,790
can multiple times before he comes back

129
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,540
to reality

130
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,820
I tried this tactic on my Grandpop's to

131
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,270
get him to stop drinking and throw

132
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,040
but all it did was you know surprisingly

133
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,520
this is pretty fun although it probably

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,170
feels a lot cooler in my head than how

135
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,000
it actually looks but who cares right

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,620
fun is fun this next one is called Star

137
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,460
Wars Clone Trooper

138
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,140
this one is a rail shooter type game it

139
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,820
comes with this gun all right so you

140
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,440
calibrate your gun let it know if you're

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,200
satisfied and presto begin plan on

142
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,690
picking up the pace get this the first

143
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,040
loading screen when you boot the thing

144
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,890
up takes 50 seconds alone doesn't that

145
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,530
somewhat diminish the plug-and-play

146
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,000
aspect well after all this loading I

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,710
better be blown away with some serious

148
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:12,950
stuff is that it then

149
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,570
what exactly were you loading all that

150
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,220
time this looks like it predates the

151
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,660
transistor radio

152
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,670
it's okay though everyone knows this

153
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,050
game was meant to honor the life of

154
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,210
legendary actor Christopher Lee as seen

155
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,160
here pictured on his cosmic Vespa and

156
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,640
now sir I give you the 21 blaster salute

157
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,890
rest in peace in legend sorry dude I'm

158
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,140
not trying to I'm trying to salute you

159
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,610
my aim is really off I'm sorry this is

160
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,830
that a lovely all right we got one left

161
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,660
I'm not expecting much after all this

162
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,610
the whole thing is just contained in

163
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,590
this cockpit joystick no censor bar or

164
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,180
anything

165
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,550
whoa what it's not terrible

166
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,919
thank cool color me impressed this is

167
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,150
probably the best plugin play game I've

168
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,710
ever played responsive

169
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,629
Luud and the graphics are in full 3d I'm

170
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,430
surprised this little thing is powering

171
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,530
all that I guess the age-old adage is

172
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,270
true after all the greatest surprises

173
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,800
come in the smallest and most unassuming

174
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,199
of packages but hey at least I have a

175
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,479
good personality this reminds me I've

176
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,550
been meaning to a plug and play myself

177
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:27,729
for a while now this one terrible the

178
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,259
first 18 levels are easy and then mom

179
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:44,000
and dad stop caring
