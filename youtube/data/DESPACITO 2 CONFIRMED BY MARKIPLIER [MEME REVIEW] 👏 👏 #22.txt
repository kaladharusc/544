1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,100
Why is millennial humor SO WEIRD?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,980
(quietly)I don't get these memes

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,240
Ha-ha!

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,220
Joke's on you dad

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,980
*disturbing sound*
You don't understand this joke

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,620
Well I understand every single level of meme intricacy of this

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,900
Hah! You think you're so smart, huh?

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,060
*disturbing sound*
Is this loss?

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,200
*disturbing sound*
hahaha

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,960
Oh, you don't understand

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,760
don't you?

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,240
Oh, you can't be part of my little secret joke club now

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,840
Yeah, I watch Marvel

14
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,340
(reading) M A R V E 
*disturbing sound* I hit 3 dogs everyday son

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,160
*disturbing sound*
Why is millennial humor so weird?!

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,960
Just don't get it. What's funny about a cartoon?

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,160
*disturbing sound*
You have been visited by a dog

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,440
So WHAT?

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,460
Where's the punchline?

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,980
*disturbing sound*

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,960
How am I supposed to haa

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,340
if I don't know what the joke is?

23
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,880
Why is millennial humor so weird? What am I even looking at?

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,700
*disturbing sound*
Why does it look so weird?

25
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,400
Why is Markiplier's face photoshopped on top of Wee sport?

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,340
whY*DISTURBING SOUND*

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,420
I don't get it!

28
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,780
*disturbing sound*
Ah... What is this?

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,860
Why is millennial humor so weird?

30
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,820
?*disturbing sound*?

31
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,380
Meme review everybody! Youtube's favorite show where I explain the joke

32
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,940
therefore ruining the joke, therefore killing the meme

33
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,500
I'm your hoes

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,940
You may have seen a Lord Farquaad with Markiplier photoshopped on top of it saying E

35
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,700
Now the joke here, it is so funny! Just wait until I explain it

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,600
But first let's review the meme.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,660
For some reason it's just a meme to photoshop Mark's face

38
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,240
on top of the fa-he-he-ce

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,100
with Lord Farquaad's

40
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,280
...based body. It looks good!

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Like, I'm strangely arou- eh- not arouse... that's a bit far

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Could it be the perfect match of the squared faces that they both have?

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm- I'm not gonna call Mark short, because I'm- people call me short when it's not true.

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,640
You know, there's a discrimination in the short community.

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,440
But here's a little of less than average... height. Let's just say that

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,920
Literally you need to be an intellectual to understand this meme

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,200
Now, of course, the more than indistinguishable this meme is - the better it gets

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Just, wait until you hear the joke, guys. It's gonna be great

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,420
This meme has now become the...

50
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,280
Oh- the joy- the millennial humor is so weird. Before he used to be like hah so straightforward

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,800
Memes then: 
Movie in jamaica. Am I a pirate of the Caribbean?

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,900
Hmmmm ?

53
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,200
Memes now:

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,820
*disturbing sound*
!EEE!

55
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,660
It started from photoshop from Cyndago!

56
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,980
It makes me so uncomfortable just looking at thi-hi-is ?

57
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,600
1950 in the future: I bet literature and culture-

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,240
I can't read. I forgot my contact lenses. Don't make fun of my glasses, guys. Okay? I don't like wearing them

59
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,760
I bet literature and culture will have advanced to be greater than ever before

60
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,220
2018:

61
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,500
*disturbing sound*
!EEEEE!

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,960
I'd be seeing a lot of these popping up and left and right

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,260
Opens a package and sets the box aside
My cat: it's free real estate

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,360
Hahaha. I understand because I know the quote!

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,200
This is another perfect example how memes are just hieroglyphic

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,800
No, one's gonna know what the f this means one day

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,520
Yes that's right. It's not like

68
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,340
communications and the way we store it information in general had improve

69
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,820
Instead beyond writing things on walls

70
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,880
Ha-ha. We're so quirky am I right? I hate this!

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,400
This tumblr-ish type of humor of like: hehe we're so random right now guys

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,780
Ha-ha

73
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,000
You're ruining this meme!

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,100
I'm sorry

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,660
aaAaaAAAAaaAaAAAa

76
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,520
!E!

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,240
Why is it funny? I DON'T KNOW

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,480
*beauliful calm music*

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,240

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,800
*beauliful calm music*

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,440
I get it now

84
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,600
I understand the humor

85
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,840
Before millennial jokes were so weird but I get it now. Eee

86
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,740
EEE, of course!

87
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,660
OF COUR-

88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,320
How can I've been so blind?!

89
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,120
!EEEEEE!

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,660

Let's just cut to the punchline ???

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,720
D for dots

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,280
Duu-tu-tuu

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Duu-tu-tuu

???

102
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,920
To E, or not to E? That is the question!

103
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,340
WALL- EeE!

104
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,000
mc square- of course

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,960
... equals E. That's right.

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,860
Oh, wow! I can barely see this one!

107
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,340
That means it's extra funnyEee

108
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,400
do-do do-do 
to-to-do-to

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,300
EEE

111
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,660
E versus B - the ultimate battle. Which meme will win? Which meme will conquer?

112
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,240
Hmm

113
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
? ?

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,980
This meme gets, of course, an

115
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,100
*disturbing sound*
E - rating

116
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,500
I would rate this an 8. Cuz it's pretty funny. 
It makes me laugh.

117
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,900
But the tumblr-ish group of 'haha we're so perky. Look, no one gets this!'

118
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,540
ruins it. So i'm gonna have to give it a 2

119
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm sorry, Mark

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,960
? ?

121
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,660

My ass / Spicy chicken curry

124
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,620
This doesn't work. You need Coca-Cola light. Everyone is keep posting this meme...

125
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,320
and a- me an intellectual, clearly. It doesn't work. You need to use Coca-Cola light. You can't use regular Coke

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
It might work a little bit, but not as effective

127
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,120
And if you want the meme to work, at least, be factually correct with your meme. Please.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,760
This has been meme correction

129
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,660
? *meme*  ? *correction*

130
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,920
Do it again and do it right

131
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,660
Mom says: Despacito. 
The Despacito meme has been going on for a long time. I know everyone's gonna be like

Everyone that writes mean comments about meme review I- I have your data

134
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,860
I will find you and I will physically harm you

135
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,600
Now I know what you're all thinking

136
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,880
Why has there not been a Despacito 2 yet? Huh?

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Why? What is taking so long? 
Donald Trump tweeted: Despacito 2 coming this fall

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,840
HOORAY!

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,320
Suicide rate drops- to 0

140
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
WOW

141
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,160
Dear liberals,

142
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,300
Despacito Neighborino

143
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
WHY IS MILLENNIAL HUMOR so weird?

144
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I don't get. It's so crazy.

145
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,840
Despacito 3 found on Mars!

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Heck, yes! So, Despacito 3 confirmed as well. But where is Despacito 2?

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,080
Dear liberals,

148
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,140
Despacito

149
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,460
The ultimate argument winner. It's taken over from
 'no you'

150
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,760
Just- just hit him with a despacito. It works every time.

151
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Fortnite collabs with Despacito!

152
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,400
YES, all my favorite things are collaborating!

153
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,860
I love that! Are- there's a lot of positivity in spread across the world

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,500
*sad music*

161
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,740
God i hate-

162
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,820
*sad music*

163
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,060
Despacito 2 will be delayed. DAMMIT

164
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,840
Elom Musk buys and then deletes Despacito

165
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,420
Stalin releases Despacito 17

166
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,040
Despacito 2 confirmed by NASA

167
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,540
Despacito 7 announced at E3

168
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,560
Nolan will direct Despacito 4. That's great.

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
Oh my God, that would be so cool

170
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,720
Like a really knit gritty and dark Despacito. Can you imagine that?

171
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,680
For now I would say this is sort of a

172
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
prequel meme

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,920
It's sort of a

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,820
can we get orange boy into Fortnite type of meme?

175
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,960
But the meme will, I think, when it thrives is- if Despacito 2 actually comes out

176
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,640
It wouldn't surprise me at this point. It's the most viewed song on Youtube of all time.

177
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,280
If they make a Despacito 2, they will make history.

178
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,300
I need a Despacito 2. I don't think I can live any longer

179
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,180
without a Despacito 2.

180
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,280
This meme gets a

181
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,220
?  ?

182
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,680
10 out of 10 because I need Despacito 2 so badly

183
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:50,100
Is there any way I can inject Despacito in my bloodstream, in my veins, in my skeleton, in my DNA?

184
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,660
Let me know. Hook me up in the comments.

185
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,440
I know the power of patriarchy. I know what men can do when they're angry

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,680
!!!WWWHHRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

187
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
And now, this...

188
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
and now

189
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
EEEEEEEEEEEE

190
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,980

*whisper*
bonus meme

193
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,860
Bonus meme this week. Finally. It's been so long

194
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,800
it'sbeensolong

195
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,020
I'm shaking. I'm shaking, guys

196
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,680
Instead of saying no

197
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,420
we can now instead just say 'yesn't'

198
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right if you're an absolute batum a SOY boy that can't face with any type of confrontation

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,260
Instead of saying 'no' you can now just say 'yesn't'!

200
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,520
Yesn't, yesn't I do no- don't you want to do tha- ? ?

201
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,500
Instead of saying 'nope', inspare yourself and saying 'nah',

202
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,440
or 'nahhen', or 'noyep', or 'noppen', or 'anti yes', 'opposite yes'.

203
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Just. Say. YESN'T!

204
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,100
There's of course ways to use this same principle in your everyday life.

205
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
Instead of playing communism, just say foodn't

206
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,520
Nurse: sir, you've been in a coma since 2017

207
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,100
Do people still use this meme format?

208
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,260
Nurse: yesn't

209
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,040
If NO can be yesn't 
and yes can be non't

210
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,540
then yes can be yes'nt'nt 
and no can be no'nt'nt

211
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,940
Men

212
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,240
Men't
???

213
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,480
This is a sexism, okay? Why can't there be' woman' and 'womann't', huh?

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,780
*applause*

215
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,840
Yes

216
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040

217
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,300

Change all stop signs to gon't signs

222
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,900
Come on, guys. If we can get a hundred times this will actually happen

223
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,120
Let's do it together for the epic meme, guys. As a community! Yeah, we're so quirky!

224
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,220
