1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,700
what's up ladies and gentleman for

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,170
YouTube look into ninety-day come out of

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,370
jail Ava's getting through the power of

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,930
the Internet I know we talked recently

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,840
about me taking a break I don't know

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,099
this is the kind of break you guys we're

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,719
talking about but I took this break I

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,450
broke my humerus bone nothing humorous

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,949
about that yes I'm wearing a sling right

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,330
now that's what you kids are wearing

11
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,680
these days right fellow kids it's what

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,869
we look it's what we look for in fashion

13
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,550
high fashion but I'm in good spirits

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,890
though I'm in a lot of pain but I ended

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,779
up breaking my arm here which means I'm

16
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:31,800
gonna take that break that I've been

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,820
needing for a while because this is

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,860
difficult and painful to deal with

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,450
especially at my age of my health so

20
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,890
we're gonna get into all of that with

21
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,320
this video but the most important thing

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,489
I think for you to know here is that

23
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,620
I'll probably be streaming a lot less as

24
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
I deal with this I'll probably be

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,190
posting a lot less videos as I deal with

26
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,719
this they're still gonna be a couple of

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,070
videos that will go live on the channel

28
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,930
I've got a few canned videos ready to go

29
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,420
split personality podcast and unboxing

30
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,489
stuff like that that'll show up maybe

31
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,520
one a week maybe two a week until I have

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,129
this all taken care of how did I break

33
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,769
my bone I know he's supposed to make up

34
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,330
a cool story like I was wrestling a bear

35
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,890
to save a baby because Nazis were

36
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,439
attacking it or whatever no I just was

37
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,210
walking out of the theater after seeing

38
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,659
ant-man

39
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,799
which is a great movie you should watch

40
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,170
it by the way no spoilers really good

41
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,869
movie though um but I was kind of in

42
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,840
shock from that post credit roll and the

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,150
post credits scene and I was looking at

44
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,409
my cell phone and I tripped on the curb

45
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,140
because I'm dumb second time in my life

46
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,689
I've broken a bone did it I know the

47
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,880
well I died I tripped on a curb when I

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,619
was a kid and got stitches I broke my

49
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,570
bone in high school playing football and

50
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,360
now I broke this bone tripping on a curb

51
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,810
I'm accident-prone what can I say um how

52
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,450
did I do that well as I began to fall I

53
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,399
shot my arms forward in front of me like

54
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,409
to defensively catch myself certainly

55
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,600
not the first time I've fallen as an

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,420
morbidly obese person um and actually if

57
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,920
you can see in this hand there's all the

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,180
defensive wounds because I did catch

59
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,799
myself with this hand but as the left

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,530
hand shot out in front of me I felt like

61
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,570
I dislocated that I felt extreme pain in

62
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,640
that upper shoulder and then that hand

63
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,489
fell limp and I instinctually as I felt

64
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,800
tucked it behind me so there's no such

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,629
defensive wounds on this hand the only

66
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,319
wounds you'll find

67
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,329
it's like a bruise on my left thumbnail

68
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:20,959
I was I just broke my bone by just

69
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,359
throwing my arm forward that's how

70
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:25,560
unhealthy I've been by the way which is

71
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,209
again a very good point of this video is

72
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,620
if you were living the lifestyle that

73
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,329
I've lived over the last forty years do

74
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,069
not do it anymore please get your shit

75
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,480
together please get proper nutrition

76
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,909
please stop eating garbage please lose

77
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,650
the weight please get healthier please

78
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,209
do the things that you need to do yes

79
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,590
this is probably complicated due to the

80
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,359
the malabsorption from the gastric

81
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,639
bypass surgery I've talked to folks in

82
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,590
my gastric bypass group broken bones do

83
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,359
happen and in the first couple of years

84
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,980
because you don't get the calcium you

85
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,359
don't get the vitamin D you don't need

86
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,799
to give the vitamin K that you need it

87
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:53,909
because you weren't able to eat enough

88
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:54,719
and you weren't able to eat the right

89
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,129
things and supplies you can't absorb the

90
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,599
supplements but there's nothing

91
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,340
conclusive there this is probably just a

92
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,040
lifetime of neglect really screwing me

93
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,319
over there's some genetic issues too my

94
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,879
mom broke I think every bone in her body

95
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,849
but she broke her femur at one point but

96
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,180
again like I said no excuses this just

97
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,250
do better than me learn from my mistakes

98
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,810
because you don't want to be a 44 year

99
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,120
old man getting surgery on your humerus

100
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,310
bones lose the weight take better care

101
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,139
of yourself health at any sizes of meth

102
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,299
take better care of yourself learn from

103
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,750
my stupid mistakes um that said I went

104
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,400
to the emergency room immediately but I

105
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,180
just thought it was dislocated

106
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,560
southerner there's gonna pop it back at

107
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
a place or something like that no they

108
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,099
did the x-rays they found that it was a

109
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,720
clean break on the humerus just below

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
the shoulder joint and they I asked the

111
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,729
surgery our doctor what do we do

112
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,379
do you splint it do you he's like no no

113
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,549
we're just gonna put in the sling

114
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,409
immobilize it and then you're gonna

115
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,939
follow over to an orthopedic on Monday

116
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,799
and if it's you know they're gonna do

117
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,509
whatever they think is best and I'm like

118
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:52,949
well what are the options because well

119
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,870
surgery are not surgery basically and

120
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,459
he's like I'm like well what do you

121
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,259
thinks gonna happen he goes I would put

122
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,120
money on surgery based on this x-ray I'm

123
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,790
like okay that sucks that's gonna suck

124
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,620
and then I finally got a contact with

125
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,750
orthopedic today and they said they

126
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,699
won't they want me an immediately first

127
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,829
thing in the morning which implies to me

128
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,209
that it's not gonna heal naturally then

129
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,030
they're gonna want to do surgery which

130
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,190
I'm not excited about that but letting a

131
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,479
hill naturally has its pros and cons

132
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,940
surgery has its pros and cons it may not

133
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,590
heal naturally so it's better to just do

134
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,810
the surgery and fortunately thanks to

135
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,030
you guys I'm in a position where

136
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,740
I can do that I have the health

137
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,120
insurance because I'm able to afford

138
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,550
health insurance now um there will be a

139
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,340
copay a very steep copay of 20 30 % I

140
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,470
can definitely afford that thanks to you

141
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,820
guys watching videos putting up with

142
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,230
sponsored videos and doing that kind of

143
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,610
thing there was a period of time where I

144
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,020
was living to paycheck to paycheck and

145
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,639
without health insurance this kind of

146
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,930
thing could have easily ruined me but

147
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,090
fortunately that's not gonna be the case

148
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,070
the insurance company will you know

149
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,480
negotiate the price down and I'll be

150
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,950
able to pay for a good chunk of it and

151
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,360
everything trying to work out great and

152
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,610
thank goodness I no longer have one of

153
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,860
those jobs where it's very physically

154
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,810
demanding you know I'll be able to

155
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,250
delegate a little bit here I can have

156
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,410
somebody upload videos for me even while

157
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,880
I'm in the hospital as long as I've got

158
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
stuff pre-canned and I do have a few

159
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,630
videos I can film something and have it

160
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,490
handed it off to an editor I have lots

161
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,140
of options I'll lose money on twitch

162
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,060
streaming but that's fine because it's

163
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,060
just like kind of bonus anyway so thank

164
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,100
you for putting me in that position

165
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,290
where I can take the time off that I

166
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,240
need that I can focus on the health and

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,350
and get the surgery I could do the

168
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,910
recovery can do the physical therapy and

169
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,350
not really worry about it that much

170
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,930
thank you and and you never have to pull

171
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,700
out a credit card you never have to buy

172
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,780
anything you never have to do anything

173
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,250
like that just by watching this video

174
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,290
you're putting me in that position where

175
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm capable if you decide you really

176
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,669
want to help out um you could just go

177
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,350
watch more videos all you got to do with

178
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,120
adblock on but that block off doesn't

179
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,479
matter

180
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,700
YouTube read youtuber aDNA it doesn't

181
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,620
matter just go entertain yourself with

182
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,270
the videos on this channel you know not

183
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,050
that's okay too

184
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,580
you absolutely feel like you need to

185
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,780
help that's all you have to do there

186
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,669
will be no GoFundMe or anything like

187
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:57,960
that I'm not in a position where I'll

188
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,850
ever need anything like that thank

189
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,350
goodness because I know so many of us

190
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,910
are and I know I have been before and

191
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,530
paycheck to paycheck it's kind of thing

192
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,270
can ruin lives fortunately it's not

193
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,370
gonna ruin mine it is really painful for

194
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,030
a while

195
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,770
it's gonna suck it's you know I'm having

196
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,450
a lot of trouble sleeping I don't really

197
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,370
like to take the opiates they prescribed

198
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,720
because my mom became addicted to those

199
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,160
and I do not want to become addicted I

200
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,860
want to finally try CBD oil i there's

201
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,960
some place that sells it locally here so

202
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm gonna actually pick some up and see

203
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,260
if it helps I'm gonna make sure my

204
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,860
doctor approves before I do it but I'm

205
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,240
hoping that'll help I'm hoping that'll

206
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,520
help with the pain a little bit you guys

207
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,410
seem to be convinced that it will in the

208
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,960
past it has never helped but maybe it'll

209
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,640
help with this I'm willing to do

210
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,910
anything at this point

211
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,180
anything to help so it looks like we'll

212
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,860
go in tomorrow consult the orthopedic

213
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,170
and I'll let you know via Twitter what's

214
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,000
going to happen there I'll probably post

215
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,010
a video update next week letting you

216
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,600
know how everything is going there'll

217
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,250
probably be a couple of videos here and

218
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,200
there I have like a couple of can videos

219
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,610
to split-personality podcast and

220
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,490
unboxing I think me lip-syncing a song

221
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,080
or singing a song I have like those

222
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,330
videos ready to go just in case

223
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,740
something like this ever did happen and

224
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,540
this is one of the scenario so the

225
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,040
channel won't be dead air there will be

226
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,560
stuff for you to watch we might do

227
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,000
reruns on Twitch or something like that

228
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,250
that's also an option too as just to

229
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,470
keep you guys entertained because I

230
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,610
don't I don't I don't want you guys to

231
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,410
miss me I I'm gonna miss you guys enough

232
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,060
I don't want you to have to miss me too

233
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,620
so hopefully there be options for you

234
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,840
and follow me on Twitter if you want to

235
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,390
keep updated on this but I am also using

236
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,980
this as an opportunity to forget about

237
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,800
all the stress and all the social media

238
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,610
and all the backlash and all the BS I'm

239
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,780
using social media for about an hour a

240
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,980
day and then everything else I'm doing

241
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,750
is focusing on my health I'm still

242
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,460
exercising a little bit it's a little

243
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,110
painful to walk on my treadmill but I'm

244
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,920
walking on my treadmill

245
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,240
I've been still been doing my leg

246
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
lifting exercises and stuff like that

247
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,320
and we rollin day two here and soon I'll

248
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,390
start physical therapy for this injury

249
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,090
this injury is difficult to do if this

250
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,680
is not a good injury to get this is

251
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,900
apparently difficult into t heal most

252
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,150
people have full range of motion at the

253
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,730
six-month mark to a one-year mark some

254
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,590
people are out of pain as early as six

255
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,960
months I'm used to pain so the pain is

256
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,360
not a big deal for me and additional

257
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,410
physical therapy is just gonna be

258
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,430
welcome at this point I'm already in

259
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,660
physical therapy anyway some more

260
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,180
physical therapy sounds great to me and

261
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,590
if we do the surgery I think you start

262
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,540
physical therapy like the day after the

263
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,790
surgery so I'm excited for that anyway

264
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,470
long story short my spirits are up I'm

265
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,880
using this as excuse to focus on my

266
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,960
health which is something I've needed to

267
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,820
do for a while I'm using this break as

268
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,880
an excuse to take a break but bear with

269
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,830
me there will still be stuff getting

270
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,030
uploaded that's not gonna be a dead

271
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,919
Channel there might still be reruns on

272
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,150
Twitch it won't be dead there I'll try

273
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,490
to stream occasionally but right now

274
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,440
done with social media for a little wall

275
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,719
I'm done with the negativity we're gonna

276
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,180
focus on healing this thing and I

277
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,470
appreciate you guys for bearing with me

278
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,810
guys as always thanks for watching I

279
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,150
love you very much and I'll speak with

280
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,050
you again

281
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,190
sooo now follow me on Twitter if you

282
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,300
want to hear me complain about this

283
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,310
every day I understand if you don't

284
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,000
that's okay too
