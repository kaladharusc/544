1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:25,980
I actually said light mayo...

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,440
DUDE! OH MY GOD!

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,600
We've been here for like half an hour!

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,740
Excuse me, but I'm a sandwich artiste.

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,580
Now if you've got a problem with it, take yo a** down to McDonald's.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,400
It's right around the corner.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,060
*The Exorcist*

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,580
Every Subway Ever

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,580
Yes. Okay. I'll talk to you later.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,080
Okay,

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,660
So what I'm gonna need are two Parmesan hot bread six-inch subs with extra Italian,

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,040
one rat-sized nibble of cheese baked onto two half palms of lettuce, dashed with sweet pepper spritzed with ham pressed authentic olive oil,

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,100
filled with Swedish roast beef fused with another six inch Sub that some veggie-vegan-veterinarian-styled,

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,240
brought down from the Himalayas by a well mannered Sherpa named Gogu.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,480
Okay, uhh... um...

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,800
You want a six-inch Pakistan...

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,300
What...?

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,920
Every Subway smells the same.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,420
Hi!

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,900
Um, I'd like a salad please.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,760
Okay. What kind of bread?

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,120
Uhh... No. a salad?

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,380
Right. What kind of bread?

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,940
Uhh, none, a salad!

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,660
RIGHT!

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,100
What kind of bread OPTION?

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,600
(PLEASE TAKE HEADPHONES OFF NOW!!!!)

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,240
A SALLAAAAAA---

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,960
Subway is the best cause it's fresh!

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
All right, man, you're all set.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Eat Fresh!

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,920
I'm sorry?

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,900
It's our slogan... Eat fresh?

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,800
I should eat fresh? So you're telling me to not eat this sandwich...

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,100
*Silence*

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,400
Yyyye... Nooo...

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
[dafuq]

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,540
Why does all your bread look sad? Doesn't matter, it's fresh!

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,000
Greetings, sir or madame.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Hey.

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
So, I'm trying to eat healthier now, so that's why I'm here at Subway today.

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,600
Do you have whole wheat bread?

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,500
Of course we do.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,610
Perfect.

45
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:09,500
I'll get two foot-long meatball Subs, with double provolone and an extra row of meatballs and the largest Coke that you have.

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,760
And then instead of chips, can I instead get a three foot long party sub dunked in mayo?

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,100
You look fresh. What's your name, subway?

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,620
I SAID, A SALAAAD!!!

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,700

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,400
NO BREAAAD! JUST VEGETABLES İN A BOOWWL!

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,040
WHA-

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,380
Wait, uhh, Bread Bowl?

53
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,100
NNOOO--

54
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,460
How many types of bread does Subway sell?

55
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,800
Lettuce and tomato?

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,720
Yes, please. And could I also get, uh, spinach,

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,400

60
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,060
Oh...

61
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry, uh, could I get a little more lettuce... please?

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Give me more lettuce.  -_-

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,400
Right, jus-just a little... little more lettuce, please, please.

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,480
Sir, am I gonna have to call your manager?! ヽ(ಠ_ಠ)ノ

65
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,860
I WANT more lettuce. Perfect. Just wrap it on up and I'll be on my very way.

66
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,820
*struggles trying to wrap it up*

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:23,700
*punches the sandwich*

68
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,800
All right... There you go.

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,700
Thank you sir.

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,600
Eat fresh!

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,799
*Sub--splosion!*

72
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,519
Could I actually get my 12-inch cut into six two inches? And then those cut in half into one inch one inches?

73
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,700
Great. Now put all the vegetables into the bowl.

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,239
Wow!

75
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,910
So it's only vegetables. Yes, a salad. It's perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. So would you like this toasted?

76
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,000
No...

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
*gets intense*

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,660
How long would you like this toasted for?

79
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,160
NOO-

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,380
I like subs, I'm not talking about subtraction.

81
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,720
I've got every single one.

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,080
Pokemon, not STDs. Hi, I would love a cup of broccoli cheddar soup. Oh my god!

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,590
She's here! THE CHOSEN ONE! THE DAY FINALLY CAME! NO ONE EVER BUYS OUR SOUP!

84

It would be my honor to serve you soup my dear lady. Yes!!

85
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,240
HOHOHOHOHO!

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,340
Sh**!

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,070
We only have chicken noodle soup today.

88
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,320

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Oh, wait.

93
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,620
Why isn't it burning? I don't know did we forget to plug the soup in? Oh...

94
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,700
We haven't had it plugged in in years. We discontinued it in like 2008. Oh my god. I guess it's just been sitting there.

95
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,920
Weird. Okay, um, in that case, I will just get a salad. For sure. What type of bread?

96
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,860
