1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,280

YouTube's boogie2988 coming at you live

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,240

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,280
Internet and I promised you more

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,230
interviews this is gonna be something

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,550
similar to that though a little bit

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,700
different because this young lady

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,800
sitting next to me she is Kati Morton

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,930
and we can find you on YouTube at Kati

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,250
Morton you're on Twitter as Katie Morris

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,630
was skating more in everywhere

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,680
everywhere and she is a qualified

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,410
licensed there licensed therapist and we

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,579
met at VidCon 2018 for the first time

15
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,130
and I will tell the story much to her

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,440
chagrin she carried me through VidCon

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,690
2018 VidCon 2018 was a really difficult

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,649
time for me it's the first time I

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,719
traveled one of the first times I

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,040
traveled without my ex-wife my first

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,590
VidCon without a constant companion and

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,879
someone to help me through it and help

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,739
me through the exciting stuff she her

24
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,079
husband her her puppy that she was

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,850
training at the time we're all very very

26
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,039
useful in fact the day of my signing

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,370
when I was so anxious to go meet 253

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,780
herd fans and do signings and take

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,520
photos she actually offered to bring the

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,519
therapy dog down to visit me and make

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,960
sure I was doing good that day so I

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
can't thank you enough for that thank

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,299
you yeah and we've been talking off and

34
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,640
on since then and she heavily encouraged

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,619
me over the summer to get back into

36
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,290
therapy to start seeing a therapist to

37
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,990
go spend a week an hour a week with a

38
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,330
therapist and and and maybe getting

39
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,680
medicated we talked about that we talked

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,970
about all kinds of stuff over the summer

41
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,400
and she was very instrumental to pushing

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,880
me into working on getting better which

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,400
is a slow process for me but still I'm

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,630
doing so much better than I was when we

45
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,670
met at VidCon so she was she was in town

46
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,530
anyway and I thought today we would

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,200
create a video for you guys talking a

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,220
little bit about mental health but I

49
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,390
know you guys are tired of hearing my

50
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,220
story so we're not gonna go over any of

51
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,159
my story here well I want to do here is

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,570
for those of you who've heard me talk

53
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,829
about there have you heard me recommend

54
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,170
therapy heard me say that therapy has

55
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,450
been useful for me I know a lot of guys

56
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,130
are broke I know a lot of you guys don't

57
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,450
have money to spend I know a lot of you

58
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,640
don't know what resources are out there

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,890
even if you do have money to spend on it

60
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,140
so I wanted to talk to you about who

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,729
qualifies for therapy who would benefit

62
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,819
from therapy in what ways we can receive

63
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,210
like some help for free

64
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,390
online and then move forward to for

65
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,800
those people who can't afford it or have

66
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
the insurance they'll pay for it

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,670
what who qualifies for like the stuff

68
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,500
that I'm doing right now once again talk

69
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,360
therapy so we were talking beforehand

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,950
you mentioned it's a big difference

71
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,660
between mental health and mental illness

72
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,160
yeah and I think it's a really

73
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,600
interesting point to make so would you

74
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,590
talk to them about that a little bit

75
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,080
yeah of course and I think people don't

76
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,760
understand everybody has a mental health

77
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,990
just like we have a physical health

78
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,240
right and it needs tending to regularly

79
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,070
this doesn't mean just like my regular

80
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,200
health means I have to sleep well and

81
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,150
you drink water I need to eat well all

82
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,200
of those things just to take care of

83
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,460
myself same with your mental health I

84
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,560
need to take breaks in my day I need to

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,570
spend time with people who I care about

86
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,860
a couple hours a Red Dead Redemption

87
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,990
everyday really exact need a pet a dog

88
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,390
things that make me feel good and that's

89
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,270
just basic self-care that tends to our

90
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,520
mental health but mental health becomes

91
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,850
a mental illness when it when your

92
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,220
mental health is bad and it affects your

93
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,680
ability to function right so when we

94
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,240
always talk about in the therapy world

95
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,850
like functionality so at school or work

96
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,000
social life and and how you're doing on

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,290
your own like upkeep hygiene you know

98
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,120
sleeping and food and all the basic ways

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,710
we take care of ourselves if any of that

100
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,680
functionality is impaired then it

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,420
becomes a mental illness and then you

102
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,040
should really seek help although with

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,420
the caveat that I truly believe that

104
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,370
therapy can help anyone and everyone

105
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,380
right so I mean if we're doing basic

106
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,150
maintenance III think back to the pickle

107
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,600
RepA soda of Rick and Morty you know if

108
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,710
everybody's doing basic maintenance

109
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,030
brushing your teeth which is something I

110
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,830
need needed to do a lot more of my 20s

111
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,830
but washing hair or shaving a beard or

112
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,330
doing the basic stuff mental health

113
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,760
taking those breaks in a day to self

114
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,170
indulge the self-care to take care of

115
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,580
yourself I think that's very basic I

116
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,610
think talk therapy can be a part of that

117
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,190
for just about anybody yes 100% I'm even

118
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,600
in therapy like let's not pretend that

119
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,890
as a therapist I have all my

120
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,900
together actually I think I think every

121
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,250
therapist is in therapy because doing

122
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,100
therapy has to make you need therapy

123
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,500
right like it's so exhausting to try to

124
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,640
deal with other people's mental health

125
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,070
and mental illness by trained a little

126
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,390
bit I took a couple site courses because

127
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,640
I wanted to be a therapist like doctor

128
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,300
heal thyself and there's a one little

129
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,320
course that they

130
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,700
one of my teacher said something that

131
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,660
really resonated with me it's like

132
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,240
imagine you have a patient who was

133
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,120
abused growing up or a patient let's say

134
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,370
if a wife who's being abused by her

135
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,380
husband right now she goes home and

136
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,660
she's abused when she leaves your office

137
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,130
and she comes back the next time with a

138
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,810
black eye and that's a patient you're

139
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,000
dealing with and then a few hours later

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,980
in the same day you have to deal with a

141
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,590
another female patient who's happily

142
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,300
married and very very rich but she's

143
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,180
stressed out about firing the gardener

144
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,490
she's difficult she's and how do you

145
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,840
deal with that how do you reconcile that

146
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,700
as a therapist and he said you know you

147
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,120
got to use objectivity in to that extent

148
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,980
that everybody's worst day is their

149
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,630
worst day she's having one of the worst

150
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,340
days that she could imagine you have to

151
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,450
help that person through the worst day

152
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,550
the day that woman leaves her husband

153
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,260
finally is going to be her worst day and

154
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,350
for this privileged woman firing the

155
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,400
gardener's the worst thing that she's

156
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,450
going to go through and you need to be

157
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,620
able to help people with both but I

158
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,420
can't imagine dealing with somebody

159
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,030
who's an abuse survivor and abuse victim

160
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,830
somebody who's experiencing ongoing

161
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,930
abuse it's got to be taxing yeah it is

162
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,190
but you learn about like healthy

163
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,410
boundaries right and I think a lot of

164
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,180
it's just like holding space for them

165
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,010
and I say that because it's like

166
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,840
consider like I'm creating a special

167
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,060
balloon where we exist hmm and that's

168
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,950
all that's important and you feel safe

169
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,660
to talk about things and I'm listening

170
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,550
I'm not judging we're able to have it

171
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,870
you know that conversation and that's

172
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,060
that one bubble or balloon right right

173
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,320
they create a whole other bubble or

174
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,410
balloon for the other person because you

175
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,670
have to meet people where they're at and

176
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,860
it is objective everybody's days it's

177
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,990
all in their own perspective and based

178
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,520
on their own experience and you can't

179
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,650
really compare to it's interesting I saw

180
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,970
I was curious what you think about this

181
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,080
I know we're getting off track but this

182
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,850
is what I do you guys are used to the

183
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,290
rambling I do on my channel but my

184
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,510
therapist mentioned he's I mentioned

185
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,980
that I do YouTube for a living it's like

186
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,690
I've purposely not looked you up on

187
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,190
YouTube and I'm like why he goes well

188
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,020
it's an ethical boundary of ours we

189
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,370
don't want to get to know you through

190
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,660
social media I need to get to know you

191
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,670
through our visits that's way more

192
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,860
important and so he's like you

193
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,330
recommended last week I look up a video

194
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,120
here's and with that I won't I simply

195
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,010
won't because it's the temptation to

196
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,540
look at the rest of the stuff I'd rather

197
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,880
hear it from your perspective here and

198
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,470
I'm like so that's that would be pretty

199
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:35,830
normal

200
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,870
yeah because the thing that's so

201
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,160
powerful about therapy

202
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,110
is that I don't know anything about you

203
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,030
other than what you tell me in session

204
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,120
because we're human too if I'm going to

205
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,620
look at all of your videos I could pass

206
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,120
judgment on certain things because it's

207
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,830
not I'm not in a therapist setting right

208
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,870
right it's not it I don't know it's just

209
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,050
he's 100% right that's interesting you

210
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,640
have to keep it separate and I'd rather

211
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,500
learn from you and your experience what

212
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,880
you want to get out of therapy in

213
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
session rather than trying to run you

214
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
know come to my own conclusions by

215
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,050
watching so when it comes to my audience

216
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,880
obviously there's gonna be plenty of

217
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,500
people who don't even realize they they

218
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,510
probably need therapy to do with people

219
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,410
out there struggling with their weight

220
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,170
issues that's something that I focus on

221
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,000
therapy right now is why I overeat and

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,980
why I choose don't even now post-surgery

223
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,210
why I'm choosing the eat the wrong foods

224
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,240
and things along that line so I know if

225
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,380
you're overweight you're struggling with

226
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,250
it right you're underweight you're

227
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,360
struggling with your weight this could

228
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,130
be a great resource for you somebody

229
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,390
who's dealing with anxiety and

230
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,800
depression I know a lot of my audience

231
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,870
responds to that when I meet you guys at

232
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,580
these big events some of your shaking

233
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,890
head to foot and you say that's pretty

234
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,590
normal during during your average day so

235
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,450
these are all definitely people I think

236
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,290
could qualify for for therapy but yeah

237
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,120
you're saying to some extent just about

238
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,680
anybody could benefit yeah because I

239
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,480
think that going back to like what your

240
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,500
therapist said about not learning about

241
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,690
you outside of the session hmm I think

242
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,800
there's something really powerful to

243
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,060
going in and talking to another person

244
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,640
in person if it's available to you and

245
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,850
not having any judgment or like let's

246
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,200
say I'm let's say I go to therapy and

247
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,790
I'm talking trash on one of my friends

248
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,560
if I'm saying that to another friend of

249
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,760
mine they're like no no but see she's

250
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,050
having a hard time like that's why she

251
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,180
was mean to you like it's invalidating

252
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,270
right and there's a like another view

253
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,070
but if you see a therapist there's no

254
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,540
other view there's no judgement that

255
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,640
someone is gonna take your side and I

256
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,750
mean when it's beneficial I mean

257
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,310
obviously a therapist is not afraid to

258
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,090
be confrontational

259
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,200
know they'll call you out right I've

260
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
been called out before and I'm glad when

261
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,919
they do right like that's still healthy

262
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,419
but someone who's gonna be on your side

263
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,370
yeah when you need somebody on your side

264
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,510
what's right to be honest I'm hearing

265
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,800
things from your perspective which i

266
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,960
think is really powerful one of the most

267
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,219
powerful things my therapist does is

268
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,870
like okay so if I'm hearing you

269
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,540
correctly you're saying and then she'll

270
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,790
repeat it back and I'm like that's

271
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,300
messed up right

272
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,740
there's something really powerful to the

273
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,360
to that kind of dynamic and it's not

274
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,649
about the therapist either it's all

275
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,970
about you so a therapist shouldn't be

276
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,260
sharing a bunch of their personal

277
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,589
stories so let's imagine YouTube shuts

278
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,660
down tomorrow I'm completely out of a

279
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,990
job I go apply for a job in retail or

280
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,730
something and like well you have you

281
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,320
don't have any work history all you've

282
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,790
done is YouTube for the last 14 years so

283
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,350
I don't know what to tell you we can't

284
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,690
hire you I'm broke now okay but I need

285
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,160
therapy I still have access to the

286
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,870
Internet yep where's a good place to

287
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,730
start I think the best place to start

288
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,430
when we have no money is peer support

289
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,890
there's a ton of peer support online so

290
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,930
finding a Facebook group for you it's

291
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,279
really has been helpful for a lot of my

292
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,930
neighbors I would highly recommend read

293
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,149
it on that front the same type of idea

294
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,589
some really great I mean like for those

295
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,269
who are having some levels of crisis

296
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,440
there's like suicide watch that's a

297
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,329
great place to post children of

298
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,490
narcissists was a wonderful subreddit

299
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,790
for me it have been very right for

300
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,160
eating disorders whether depend on what

301
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
eating disorder you struggle with

302
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,070
there's support groups for that so

303
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,620
that's a great resource also 7 cups it

304
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,029
used to be called 7 cups of tea it's

305
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,029
just a online chat forum and you can do

306
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,320
it on your phone and an app or you can

307
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,180
do it on your desktop but it's peer

308
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,920
support it's trained counselors people

309
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,079
who are trained to be able to help you

310
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,940
manage maybe any crisis or difficulty

311
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,980
and all this is entirely free like zero

312
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,890
100 right you know that's wonderful so

313
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,320
how do I want to obviously peer support

314
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,820
and that's peer support 7 cups as well

315
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,020
yeah yeah

316
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,550
so that's a great way to start if you

317
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,870
have no money and you're kind of scared

318
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,610
you don't really know how to reach out

319
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,990
or maybe it's just like in the middle of

320
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,250
a night you have no one to talk to

321
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,380
those are great resources and then from

322
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,750
there to get help by a professional I

323
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,700
mean there's my channel that's can be a

324
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,170
great resource because it's all free and

325
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,810
you get to hopefully understand a little

326
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,120
bit more about your 2.com slash game

327
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,550
Morin right yeah and I've watched a good

328
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,600
number of your videos that's something I

329
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,770
do highly recommend I obviously wouldn't

330
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,149
have her here if I didn't enjoy the

331
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,630
channel I think but and there's plenty

332
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,079
of plenty of professional help people on

333
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,519
YouTube but your problem of the very few

334
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,320
qualified ones yeah there's a lot of

335
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,459
people sharing their own experience

336
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,870
which is really powerful for you of

337
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,120
course um but my channels definitely

338
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
more of the education based around like

339
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,270
how do we diagnose how do we treat what

340
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,230
should you say when you see a

341
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,820
professional right because that can save

342
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,470
you time and money too so if we know

343
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,510
oh maybe you didn't have a word for what

344
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,770
it is but now you realize it's panic

345
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,210
attacks that you're experiencing you

346
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,500
just thought like I'm just short of

347
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,960
breath and I spaced out sometimes if you

348
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,790
have a word that means that then we can

349
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,110
look for a therapist who understands

350
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,450
anxiety right panic disorders and so

351
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,970
hopefully that can shorten you know the

352
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,950
maybe oopsie I saw someone who kid

353
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,560
doesn't treat me so I was thinking when

354
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,910
we're talking online resources that

355
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,230
would be more for people who want to do

356
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,480
the basic maintenance level stuff but it

357
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,070
sounds like I mean there's definitely

358
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,690
resources out there for people who are

359
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,100
wanting to go much much deeper

360
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,360
I would always I think we would always

361
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
ward away from self diagnosis yeah

362
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,620
sometimes you can use these tools to get

363
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,850
a pretty good idea but you don't want a

364
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,320
WebMD yourself because you know

365
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,560
everything turns out to be cancer right

366
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,640
especially somebody who's experiencing

367
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,560
anxiety issues you definitely self

368
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,970
diagnosed in the wrong direction and

369
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,100
make things I got something I always had

370
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,330
to be very careful with and I recommend

371
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,790
that but it does sound like you know

372
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,930
what you're doing with you have a

373
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,030
diagnosis or you're 90% sure there's

374
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,620
resources out there for that as well for

375
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,170
free yeah I have workbooks that are free

376
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,790
on my website or they're like I think a

377
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,830
dollar a dollar ninety-nine on iTunes if

378
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,800
you want it in an iBook format eating

379
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,770
disorders anxiety self-injury and even

380
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,050
have an lgbtq+ workbook so those are all

381
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,240
like with videos and homework and things

382
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,650
you can download right all sorts of

383
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,740
resources and then if we're moving into

384
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,500
direction of more physical realm yeah I

385
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,690
know I will recommend I've used this as

386
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,800
well and if you have anything to say

387
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,780
about others I'd love to hear it but

388
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,280
there are definitely therapy

389
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,570
organizations out there if you're

390
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,100
northwest arkansas for example there is

391
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,780
our guidance which is a company that

392
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,910
will work with you based on your income

393
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,410
level and they don't just look at like

394
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,060
the amount they earning they look at how

395
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,380
much you can afford to spend they'll

396
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,600
actually look at what your maintenance

397
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,770
is for your rent in your house and

398
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,150
everything else and sometimes they give

399
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,950
me as much as ten or fifteen bucks to

400
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,720
just walk in and it's almost just like a

401
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,550
donation more than it is anything and

402
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,570
there's a lot of places like that you

403
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,400
have to ask around so the main thing I

404
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,960
because I worked at a place like it was

405
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,720
art guidance it's in North Hollywood in

406
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,850
LA and essentially people either were

407
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,620
charged nothing I think the most a

408
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,180
person paid to see me was 40 bucks right

409
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,670
and so there's there are those kinds of

410
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,590
resources and just look for clinics in

411
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,500
your area or low cost counseling and put

412
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,840
insert where you live and then also

413
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
something that people don't realize is

414
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,560
when you

415
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,570
see a therapist let's say I charge $100

416
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,120
an hour but you're like I like you I

417
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,650
want to see you but I can't afford that

418
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,540
it's okay to ask a therapist do you work

419
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,730
on a sliding scale that's the term that

420
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,590
you use and you can just ask them and I

421
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,200
mean I've seen patients for as like half

422
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,089
of what I normally charge or less I've

423
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,350
even seen patients for free for a while

424
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,580
while they're transitioning between jobs

425
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,710
let's say you two did shut down and you

426
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,810
were transitioning it would be patient

427
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,000
abandonment technically but I could

428
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
refer you out but I prefer not to I'd

429
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,300
rather see you for free let's say like

430
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,710
three or four months until you get back

431
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,720
on your feet people get into what we do

432
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,630
to help others and hopefully if you've

433
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,430
met a good therapist they're doing just

434
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,930
that and you know they'll work with you

435
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,220
and I think that's really really

436
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,870
important for people who live in a small

437
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,580
town where these types of resources are

438
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,190
very very limited yeah especially in the

439
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,140
impoverished town like I grew up in st.

440
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,300
Paul Virginia which I know is do a lot

441
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,680
better now by the way if you're high for

442
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,790
say Paul you guys did a lot better than

443
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,700
what I was there but that said there was

444
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,520
a handful therapists in the county and

445
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
it was difficult to even just get

446
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,000
yourself located to the same place they

447
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
were it we're driving 20 minutes to see

448
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,940
if there was 30 minutes to an hour

449
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,760
sure and those therapists were very very

450
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,839
quick even though they could be

451
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,820
overworked they were very very quick to

452
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,560
work with somebody who's underprivileged

453
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,730
because they live in the area they know

454
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,080
the area they understand that they're

455
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
underprivileged and so they're gonna

456
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,260
block out as many people as they can

457
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,360
that they can help while still making a

458
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
living you should never be afraid to

459
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,870
call a local therapist if there's only

460
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,610
two or three in your County like it was

461
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,440
for me call that person and say look I'm

462
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,330
this is my situation I need help

463
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,510
do that initial intake um if you could

464
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,550
afford it and and see if they'll even do

465
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,900
this though pro-bono sometimes the

466
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,520
initial intake yeah just as an

467
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,750
opportunity to get to know you to see

468
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,980
what kind of help you need to see if

469
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,089
you're a good fit for that therapist

470
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,440
anyway that's something else I would

471
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,320
like to talk about

472
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,720
so as a normally obese person I learned

473
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,670
very quickly that not every physical

474
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,200
doctor like general practitioner was

475
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,530
going to work for me some were going to

476
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,150
diagnose only the obesity and then in

477
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,560
there some were going to help me with

478
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,050
the symptoms of the obesity and so I

479
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,300
needed a doctor who had helped me with

480
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,980
the symptoms of the obesity I understand

481
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,690
that the obesity was the the root cause

482
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,850
yeah but that's not where I want to stop

483
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,170
I need help with the symptoms I need

484
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,600
someone who's empathetic and sympathetic

485
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,850
and so not every doctor will be a good

486
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,889
and you should always be persistent and

487
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,560
how you get your your physical care I

488
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,970
think when it comes to mental health

489
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,889
care you should be persistent there as

490
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:40,940
well and I think you should look for a

491
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,949
therapist who's a good fit so we talked

492
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,240
a little bit about try and finding a

493
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,259
therapist is a good fit because I was

494
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,060
telling you before my career therapist

495
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,800
is a wonderful fit like on so many

496
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,110
levels so when I'm shopping around for a

497
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,160
therapist what am i what am I looking

498
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,170
for you're looking for and this is gonna

499
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,430
sound weird but you're just looking for

500
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,310
the click which really means that when

501
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,230
you meet them their office feels

502
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,480
comfortable it's awkward at first it's

503
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,130
always awkward at first but overall

504
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,430
you're like it's not bad they seem nice

505
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,920
right they I feel like they hear me I

506
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,740
feel like they're on my team and I feel

507
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,660
like we could work together and I know

508
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,490
that those are like it's hard to even

509
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,190
you're like I want like a ABCD it's not

510
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,269
really like that's like a relationship

511
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,839
so you need to if you get like a feeling

512
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,269
or push off or I don't really I'm not

513
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,199
comfortable

514
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,690
then you shouldn't go back but if you

515
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,819
feel somewhat comfortable as awkward as

516
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,680
it is you kind of like them and make

517
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,120
sure that like there's some things you

518
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,589
should look out for like they should

519
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,269
remember basic things about you you

520
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,470
shouldn't have to keep repeating your

521
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,259
name or the name of your spouse or your

522
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,180
girlfriend or boyfriend or dog they

523
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,550
should remember some basic things um

524
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,189
basic issues you're working on if

525
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,149
they're not remembering if they're

526
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,339
falling asleep anything like that not

527
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,889
good you'd be surprised the Holly wait

528
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,959
falling asleep mm-hmm that's a thing

529
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,370
that can my viewers are over here

530
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,290
they've told me yeah oh my goodness it's

531
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,730
the same so that's just paying attention

532
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,549
being present with you and they

533
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:05,630
shouldn't talk about themselves too much

534
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,240
like I was saying it's your time

535
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,530
therapists may share small stories to

536
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,390
empathize to be like oh yeah like let's

537
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,730
say you lost a loved one they could say

538
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,339
yeah I lost my grandpa two years ago I'm

539
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,199
really sorry I know how hard grief can

540
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,569
be they can share little tidbits to help

541
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,339
empathize but it shouldn't be much it's

542
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,390
actually best if you don't know that

543
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,740
much about your therapist because

544
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,270
otherwise you can start to make

545
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,709
assumptions about them and not want to

546
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,940
share things and it's best if we just

547
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,200
feel like we're all on the same level

548
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,539
right and I think this is something a

549
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:34,039
running to you as well I've run into

550
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,970
therapists who wanted to be my friend

551
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,350
who didn't want to be friendly and

552
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,520
provide a service they wanted to be my

553
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,409
friends not something like and like

554
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:40,820
right like I I'm not here to hear

555
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,500
stories about you my friend no it's your

556
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,110
time right

557
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,730
I'm paying I'm paying full price in my

558
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,510
local place right now so it's 100% you

559
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,970
which is it's which again by the way if

560
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,770
you have some level of insurance I mean

561
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,240
like if you even have like the basic

562
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,090
bronze tier insurance a good number of

563
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,830
insurance companies will help compensate

564
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,480
they will not cover it in its entirety

565
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,760
but they will they'll help compensate

566
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,309
and on some level sometimes it will

567
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,840
require someone network sometimes

568
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,570
require so always make sure and talk

569
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,700
your your health care provider about

570
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,250
whether or not they'll work with your

571
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,200
insurance company yeah and with the

572
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,520
right insurance company I mean nice

573
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,710
people will see you for free totally and

574
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,210
I mean even with my insurance my

575
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,070
therapists think I'd pay $70 as a copay

576
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,470
which is a lot but she would probably

577
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,880
work with me if I couldn't afford that

578
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,500
we could figure out another way but ask

579
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,880
your insurance and know that even if

580
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,840
they give you a limited number of

581
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,660
sessions your therapist can petition for

582
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,669
more right so know that you do have

583
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,040
rights to ask for more right um and

584
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,390
usually they'll call it like a parity

585
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,220
diagnosis which just means like a

586
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,290
instead of having like oh they're just

587
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,970
struggling with some grief issues it

588
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,110
could be like no they have depression

589
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,910
right and that gets you more sessions

590
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,260
right so just know that there are things

591
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,910
we can do to ensure that you get the

592
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,620
care that you need and then I think I

593
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,020
probably the one thing that I will I'm

594
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,480
guilty of and this something I this is

595
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,179
more about me than you but as someone

596
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:02,770
who's thought to himself therapy it's

597
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,690
not gonna help it's not useful it's not

598
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,250
a useful tool I said to myself I'm

599
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,130
smarter than my therapist I know more

600
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,299
than he does I don't want to do any

601
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,309
worksheets I hate worksheet I don't want

602
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,660
I don't want to go in and do work she

603
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,070
said I want to do homework I need talk

604
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,470
therapy need cognitive behavioral I need

605
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,120
somebody to an intervene I need and

606
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,559
those these guys are not gonna do it

607
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
here's the thing shop around till you

608
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,100
find a therapist who will help who is

609
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,780
useful who is in her who will intervene

610
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,429
very first thing I said to this new

611
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:28,660
therapist is I'm like look if we have to

612
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,150
do worksheets I'm going home we're like

613
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,220
we're done right like I I'm not gonna

614
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,840
sit down with a flow chart that shows

615
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,780
how anxious I was in a day versus how

616
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,220
much I ate that day to see if there's a

617
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,600
correlation yeah there's a correlation

618
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,669
buddy I order a pizza I'll tell you when

619
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:44,440
I screw up on Twitter okay we don't need

620
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,540
to do a worksheet for this well let's

621
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,919
your pain level like dairy you're more

622
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,660
anxious on the base you're an extra pain

623
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,419
yeah yeah it's pretty this is pretty you

624
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,090
know so again I would imagine there is

625
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,030
no situation that's so bad

626
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,130
that you can't get therapy and I think

627
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,370
you have to be in a place of mine if

628
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,410
you're not willing to do the work yeah

629
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,730
if you're not willing to let somebody in

630
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,020
if you're not willing to work with

631
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,870
somebody but to say that is to say you

632
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,190
don't want to get better you're not

633
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,990
willing to get better right yeah and

634
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,100
that's the thing is like therapy doesn't

635
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,530
work unless you work it so you have to

636
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,270
want to get better or at least you don't

637
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,860
even have to want to get better you have

638
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,400
to hate how it is yep absolutely people

639
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,750
would be like well I don't want to give

640
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,970
up my eating disorder like that's my

641
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,320
specialties eating disorders and self

642
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,520
injuries people be like I don't want to

643
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,080
give it up I'm like that's okay you

644
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,000
don't have to you just hate it where

645
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,620
you're at and I now know what we're

646
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,990
talking about when we do her video so

647
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,460
that said guys I think I think we I

648
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,020
think we've tapped it I think we're at a

649
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,640
point where I think we've identified
