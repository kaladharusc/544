00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,340

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,579

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,100
these will be all right all right you're not like specific

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,219
it's just like surfing but through the streets of Manhattan yeah how's New York

11
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,210
City been freaking out here but I could live here i could fully live yet

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,119
maybe this is a really bad idea you have to lean into it then you know Dan is

15
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,469
like one person I cannot give a hard time too because i was in South Africa

16
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,100
with him

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,030
this guy's like a champion surfer and he had to put up with me sucking in the

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,079
ocean

19
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:26,079
he was very sweet about it so

20
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
did you want to scream

21
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,480
look at all that green

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,250
all right let's go

23
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,060
that was really impressive down yeah man for someone who doesn't skateboard

24
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,720
this one is yours is the deeper yeah it's pretty strong

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,020
what time is your flight like knowledge but I'll see in Cape Town you please

26
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,650
yeah

27
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,910
is it this time well sir so from the sea not on the street

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:24,020
sweetbreads get the seeds are good to see you he travels a catch isn't by ok

29
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,020
back to today's youtube video

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,950
yeah

31
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,430
there are a lot of reoccurring themes in this blog and lately there have been

32
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,080
there have been two themes and the trouble with those two themes is that

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,819
they're entirely contradictory

34
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,230
they really don't make sense together whatsoever and that's what i wanted to

35
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,220
explain today

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,180
those two contradictory themes are how I absolutely love new york city and all

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,650
that it represents and then how can this and I are always talking about moving in

38
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,060
leaving New York City

39
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,090
then I i did want to preface this whole thing by saying my work my life my

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,239
business which I have no intention of moving

41
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
they're all here in New York City so this conversation that Candice and I are

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,170
always having about moving out of New York City

43
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,819
it's not like tomorrow or this week it's years in the future it's it's

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,740
this this is how I see Life this

45
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,540
well this is a book called no country for old men but a book a book is a

46
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:51,850
perfect metaphor for how I see Life now a book is made up of chapters just like

47
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,510
life

48
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,090
so your life is broken up into these chapters and for me a chapter is like a

49
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,950
segment in life that feels kind of compartmentalize like my childhood my

50
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,100
childhood is a really compartmentalised aspect of my life

51
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,970
chapter one in the book that is my life

52
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,020
this is literally the last time I graduated from any school in my entire

53
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,980
life

54
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,000
I was frustrated for the vast majority of my childhood

55
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,040
that's me crying and that's my dad and me in Central Park

56
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,780
I don't like four years old there check out my hat anyway childhood

57
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,000
chapter one

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,610
now this next chapter which is chapter 2 when i dropped out of high school ran

59
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,930
away from home

60
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,150
had baby Owen was on welfare like living in a trailer park this was a really

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,790
challenging time in my life is also from when i went from being a kid to be an

62
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,780
adult

63
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,870
look that's Owen and that to me is own second birthday so fat I was

64
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,740
look at that fat face i had that's all in

65
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:10,300
that's my mom and that's me with my very first video camera now

66
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:18,190
chapter three chapter 3 started when I moved to New York see it was me leaving

67
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,350
behind like a life and be pursuing a life of the unknown like me chasing a

68
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,250
dream

69
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:31,330
this is my very first press book that says nice that press october two

70
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,729
thousand two

71
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:37,740
until august two thousand for these were the very first time that anything I ever

72
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,809
did get any recognition

73
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:44,430
this is the first time i ever saw my name in print a film that my brother and

74
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,439
I made got runner-up in some film festival and look it says my name right

75
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,249
there in this part this segment chapter 3

76
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,009
if i had to put one title on this part of my life I would definitely call it

77
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,589
New York City this hugely transformative phase in my life took place that happen

78
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,729
because it

79
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:12,389
it is completely married to this great city all the sudden I'm like married and

80
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,649
I have a one-year-old baby and kid it's about to go to college and I have a

81
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,719
business and I have all of these have all this established stuff and if there

82
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:24,809
was something that was missing from all of chapter three is any sort of

83
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,319
establishment that entire phase of my life was about recklessness and

84
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,279
spontaneity

85
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,719
so I think that right now I'm entering into a new chapter

86
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,860
I never ever saw myself living in any one place for the whole of my life and

87
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,330
I've been in New York now for 15 years and when I think about the future

88
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,659
I think like an environmental change is something that's really interesting to

89
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:56,699
me and I don't believe that liking something so much should preclude you

90
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,560
from trying something new

91
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,349
what that literally means is even though i absolutely love this city

92
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,399
that is not a good enough reason for me to not try something else

93
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,620
so yes my affinity for an obsession around this city

94
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,979
absolutely contradicts my curiosity about leaving the city but I've also

95
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,920
always said New York City is only for the young and broke and the rich and all

96
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,730
and I'm entering into a phase of my life around neither of those two

97
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,140
I hope that was helpful also for whatever it's worth

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,200
we're not going anywhere for years like who knows where i'll be in a couple

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:50,480
years for context i will be walking for like eight months just a special end of

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,430
the vlog announcement

101
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,960
i'll be posting a second video today this afternoon at three pm

102
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,890

103
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,450
