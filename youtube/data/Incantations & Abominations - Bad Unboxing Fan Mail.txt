fluids that the LifeStraw be good as new

73
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,820
alright I think the only way that we're

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,650
gonna do this is by actually creating a

75
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,320
little nice fluffy tinder pile we don't

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,820
need to use the whole thing don't want

77
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,500

better Nutt care going on it doesn't

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,580
doesn't stand on its own so you need to

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,710
apply a little bit of Barbasol to it I

110
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,330
should be able to shade that pretty

111
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,330
nicely now it is thick and creamy

112
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,470
they're not lying

113
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,780
in fact it's so thick and creamy that it

114
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,580
could probably double in some sort of

168
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,600
of sorcery at our disposal here for

169
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,220

170
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,440
