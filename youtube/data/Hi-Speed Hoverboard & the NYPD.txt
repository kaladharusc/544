such a good song alright real talk if

29
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,030
you're not new to this vlog you know in

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,460
season one even season two hours super

31
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,350
consistent and uploading every single

32
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,810
day almost always at the same time and

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,850
since I started season 3 I've been

34
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,399
nothing but sporadic when I upload and I

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,319
wanted to take a second to explain let

36
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:35,349
me animate this see in vlogs season 1

37
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,520
and 2 the vlog really dictated a lot of

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,590
my life maintaining the interestingness

39
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,989
of the vlog the actual act of creating

40
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,319
and then just the sheer amount of hours

41
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,780
dictated my life

42
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,410
for season three I'm making sure my life

43
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,450
dictates the law focusing on family is

44
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,860
more important than focusing on making

45
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,990
the episodes interesting my job is more

46
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,550
important and spending time focusing on

47
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,520
health goes above spending time editing

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,970
the vlog now now the only way to do that

49
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,620
and make sure the vlog doesn't suck is

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,390
by being selective when I do it you know

51
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,100
like we were with family in Texas the

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,450
last couple of days it was all about

53
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,069
family the baby was their own was there

54
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,200
at Candace's parents were there that had

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,510
to take precedent over the stress of

56
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,820
creating a daily show somebody sent me

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,550
this I don't I don't know what this is

58
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,050
you know down at beam we're working all

59
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,459
kinds of things so we're gonna start

60
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,489
making shows and and movies and all

61
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,230
kinds of stuff down there that means

62
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,489
they're gonna be more days and I don't

63
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,280
make the vlog what matters is that these

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,290
episodes are good and I'd rather make

65
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,910
them you know four or five times a week

66
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,709
and have them be really good then make

67
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:48,850
them seven days that we can have them

68
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,470
suck and then the other thing it's

69
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,160
important is is sustainability it's when

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,900
I think back to why I stopped blogging

71
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,780
the previous two seasons like I started

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,269
to hate it and I think it was just the

73
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,680
roulette like the fact that I'd never

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,360
had time to think it was just go go go

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,260
go go which has its virtues but also

76
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,310
after a year and a half it was just it

77
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,239
was unsustainable

78
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,209
so I'm hoping this new sort of thesis

79
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,669
this this this new approach to vlogging

80
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:20,290
it's something that's more sustainable I

81
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,840
can tell you this much I love doing it

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,970
again like the process now is so much

83
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,340
more I know it's more relaxing it's more

84
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,260
exciting it's like yesterday on the

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,970
plane when the baby was freaking out and

86
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,440
Candice was freaking out and I was

87
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,750
freaking out instead of also trying to

88
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,400
make a video at during that stressful

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,620
time instead I was like exciting about

90
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,419
getting back to it today you know I

91
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,789
looked at a lot of my youtube friends

92
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,240
when they stop vlogging like Gina and

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,700
Jessi BF versus gf those are my favorite

94
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,020
YouTube channels some of my favorite

95
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,210
vloggers you know they talked about the

96
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,039
stress that it had on their personal

97
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,050
life and other aspects of their life I'm

98
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,669
just trying to be responsible and trying

99
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,979
to navigate that so I'll still see you

100
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,569
almost every day I'll try to

101
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,309
click upload amis every day but I hope

102
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:07,869
this makes sense and I'm gonna make

103
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:10,389
exist the largest sometimes here at beam

104

New York City that have these street

180
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,319
teams often they give away free stuff

181
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,269
that I guess they just assume people are

182
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,399
gonna want these guys here they give

183
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,160
really free chocolate milk just one of

184
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:53,290
the great perks of living here I'm on

185
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,829
the one wheel dramatic difference from

186
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,629
the from the previous generation one

187
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:07,180
wheel it's is pretty incredible

[Music]

189
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,450
okay so there's definitely a learning

190
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:35,850
curve here I'm getting there

[Music]

192
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,870
not a lot of opportunities to test the

193
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,370
off-road capabilities of the wooden

194
00:10:46,370 --> 00:11:01,400
wheel here in New York City

195
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,220
I really feel like they took care of all

196
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,290
the shortcomings all the beefs that I

197
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,839
had with the original version now this

198
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,680
thing's like I mean it's smooth is

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,470
butter it's crazier responsive it's a

200
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,080
lot faster I feel much more in control I

201
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,250
don't know that I'd become bull riding

202
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,810
this in New York City traffic but I said

203
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,760
the same thing about the booster I had

204
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,400
my helmet I left my helmet blue test in

205
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:40,850
traffic

says the man not rich rich what are you

208
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,000
thinking in one wheel it's nice right

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,430
it's one day man

211
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,110
I gotta say this thing's pretty pretty

212
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,540
impressive one wheel you know I would

213
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,450
say the question I get asked the most is

214
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,800
should I get a one wheel or should I get

215
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,370
a boosted board if I had an answer for

216
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,240
it if you live in a city like I do

217
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,470
boosted boards grace it's wonderful on

218
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,970
the road if you live in a place where

219
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,820
there's any off-road or trails or water

220
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,470
or sand or dirt the one wheels fantastic

221
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,600
for that so I could never ever say that

222
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,690
one is better than the other but this

223
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,649
one wheel is wildly impressed okay

224
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,120
alright just give me go ahead and in the

225
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,980
broad right there

226
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:18,000
