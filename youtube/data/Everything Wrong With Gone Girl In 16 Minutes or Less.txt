2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,710
when I think of my wife it seems like

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,179
movies don't get made these days unless

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,769
they start with narration movie thinks

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,330
it can sneak a Tyler Perry credit by me

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,830
hoping I won't notice and wrongfully

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,300
hoping I forgiven him for why did I get

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,070
married to the morning of what the

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,630
morning of what yeah yeah we know it

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,590
means this is the morning of her

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,150
disappearance but will her disappearance

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,130

15
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,480
will be gone girl I mean I won't be

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,009

17
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,829
present Oh Master Mind was clue too

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,149
subtle for this movie about mysteries

19
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,860
and psychological warfare that's it

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,540
isn't clue missing from this stack of

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,010
games oh wait I forgot

22
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,510
Nick's character is totally clueless in

23
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,770
his movie that crazy brilliant ass

24
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,030
Fincher made me think my way out of a

25
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,270
sin father sitting regardless I I have I

26
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,480
came fast and furious please don't name

27
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,829
the franchise that shall not be named

28
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,520
I'm so crazy stupid happy diary reading

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,440
I am narration they already relieved me

30
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,590
of my artisanal meat platter finally

31
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,489
someone tells me how to pronounce that

32
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,920
word me cutesy 1930s quick talking

33
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,390
patter in lieu of speaking like normal

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,310
modern humans cliche tone it down Nick

35
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,619
and Nora I rock hipster so self-aware it

36
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,909
makes everything a joke Nick really

37
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,049
knows the way to a woman's heart

38
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,509
stereotyping tuxedo guy was allowed into

39
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,950
what seems to be a relatively classy

40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,420
party since he's become an amusing part

41
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,740
of Nick and Amy's conversation I can

42
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,909
only assume he was invited by the

43
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,310
screenwriter knock hipster so sophomore

44
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,930
I'm executing a joke the only way this

45
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,700
scene is even remotely believable is if

46
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,439
we find out this is actually some 500

47
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,820
days of summer fantasy sequence that

48
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,840
he's playing in his head to psych

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
himself up to go talk to this girl he

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,070
gets your chin villainous maybe that's

51
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,390
why Batman seemed like the bad guy

52
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,340
during that bold movie I watched that

53
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,590
one time you have to see this apparently

54
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,270
Nick knows New York so well he knows an

55
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,920
alley where a bakery creates a virtual

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,869
sugar storm and 11 excuse to kiss this

57
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,030
woman he just met also Amy follows a man

58
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,740
she just met down an alley without any

59
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,180
question after he says you have to see

60
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,570
this

61
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,860
it's amazing everyone is so surprised

62
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,290
when she goes missing she kissing missed

63
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,180
opportunity for a sugar pun but Who am I

64
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,500
kidding I would have send them for that

65
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,570
too dad is she asking him this like a

66
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,049
caveman

67
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,869
oh wait mcdonnen is his name got it even

68
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,219
though Nick lands on the get married

69
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,020
block he lets Margot spin and doesn't

70
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,369
take the honeymoon spin the rules

71
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:08,789
dictate

72
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,080
because he doesn't know how to play the

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,640
game of life wait maybe that's an

74
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
extremely subtle metaphor god damn it -

75
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,040
once

76
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,379
there's no good gift for what I know go

77
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,269
home her brains out slap with your penis

78
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,760
there's some wood for you bitch Margot

79
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,200
says almost exactly what I am thinking

80
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,409
which is definitely a sin neighbor wall

81
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,299
called NIC at the bar to tell him that

82
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,890
his cat escaped but didn't go get the

83
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,940
cat to keep it safe

84
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,379
also the cat stayed in the front yard

85
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,700
from the time of the phone call until

86
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,819
nick arrived home suggest bedroom their

87
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,260
cat's room on the end just a minute ago

88
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,940
we saw that Nick decided to put the cat

89
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,560
his bedroom so if the cat has its own

90
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,810
room why not their detective has some

91
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,519
sort of endearing way of marking crucial

92
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,870
areas of a house with little sticky

93
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,640
notes instead of I don't know taking

94
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,709
pictures detective boney only marks the

95
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,299
blood spatter over the stove even though

96
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,769
there's clearly visible blood spatter on

97
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,510
the bottom cabinets too unless Amy

98
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,620
attended the lesser-known

99
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,629
rattle feed college at Harvard they

100
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,190
definitely spelled Ratcliffe wrong on

101
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,780
her diploma also I'm pretty sure the

102
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,250
person who signed as the president of

103
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,989
Harvard is named something McKee and not

104
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,819
Neal are rotten Stein it was actually

105
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,069
the president of Harvard in 1992 overall

106
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,569
I'm seriously doubting the legitimacy of

107
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,430
Amy's Harvard diploma curious whether

108
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,629
it's difficult for you to see amazing

109
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,730
Amy heading down the aisle and this big

110
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,739
party celebrating this fictional wedding

111
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,359
because it's my understanding you are

112
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,889
not married these journalists and

113
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,630
bloggers decide to take turns asking a

114
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,950
section of the same question like

115
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,569
they're playing an improv game also

116
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,660
botnik his very first pair says Nick an

117
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,790
adult man didn't own scissors until at

118
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,829
most two years ago I don't care how much

119
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,450
of a slob you are everyone needs to cut

120
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,480
with scissors challenge me she surprised

121
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
me and have a world-class vagina who

122
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,340
says this to a woman he loves in front

123
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,810
of a whole bunch of reporters except me

124
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,280
to Serena Williams just before a whole

125
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,599
bunch of French police come out to

126
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,370
tackle me Oh son I got a law-and-order

127
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,019
up so that by the way if you don't know

128
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,519
Nick is painfully unaware of his own

129
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,139
actions during this investigation this

130
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,579
movie will make you painfully aware of

131
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,889
his unawareness dad Nick's dad just

132
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,239
happens to be here at the police station

133
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,650
right now which is convenient for the

134
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,150
plot since it makes him remember to go

135
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,379
to his dad's house for the next clue

136
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,329
you're Nick Dunne we've been trying to

137
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,829
get ahold of you all afternoon

138
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,799
so could you not call his sister I don't

139
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,389
understand did they find a secret room

140
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,359
in this bookstore for Amy timpz

141
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,639
coincidentally for Amy tips is the name

142
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,410
of a DVD I own that my wife doesn't know

143
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,019
about also isn't the for superfluous Amy

144
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,330
tips or two six nine eight four seven

145
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,130
seven is enough numbers he attempted

146
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,130
suicide after

147
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,900
broke up with him sophomore year and

148
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,490
thus begins the Miss casting of Neil

149
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,690
Patrick Harris who was way too

150
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,220
well-known for How I Met Your Mother and

151
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,690
just in general being Neil Patrick

152
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,430
Harris when this movie came out sorry

153
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,960
it's just the way it is you know for a

154
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,190
fact someone's going to arrange the

155
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,510
letters on this thing to say help find

156
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,120
Amy's one day so this is pointless to be

157
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,670
trained and paraded husbands who treat

158
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,380
their lives like the Highway Patrol

159
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,820
I feel entitled to a scene from Nick and

160
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,230
Amy's newlywed years where they are

161
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,460
discussing how they are so much better

162
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,440
than normal married couples I think I'm

163
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,740
gonna be laid off or in a recession if

164
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,600
it happens we'll deal with it I'll

165
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
probably be next

166
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,180
even though Nick and Amy are both highly

167
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,860
educated and Amy comes from a pretty

168
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,630
influential family they both get laid

169
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,250
off somehow Nick thinks he can just park

170
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,170
that Volvo anywhere you see that guy

171
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,760
like vas is beautiful I tend to get a

172
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,160
lot of Dewar's Frank's so we're just

173
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,930
gonna brush past desi Collings the guy

174
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,490
who amy's parents claimed tried to kill

175
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,780
himself after Amy broke up with him

176
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,310
there's no reason to question him right

177
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,050
apparently Mario records baseball games

178
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,910
on her DVR man still hasn't watched the

179
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,680
game from June 30th which is a week old

180
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,510
at this point also she records the local

181
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,280
news even before Amy's disappearance and

182
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,660
has a couple of them recorded on July

183
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,850
2nd and July 4 this is some DVR nonsense

184
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,080
no one should put up with but I know

185
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,220
Nick is an idiot did you leave the pair

186
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,160
of red pains in my office maybe isn't

187
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,750
putting pennies in someone's office the

188
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,130
type of thing you definitely remember

189
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,780
like are you putting pennies in so many

190
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,010
places that you forgot about the time

191
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,630
you left a parent in office and isn't

192
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,550
that expensive to check my red panty in

193
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,560
the statement sounds like sarcasm but

194
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,180
I'd be more surprised if she didn't have

195
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,550
a red panty inventory Sean on a gun felt

196
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,820
bad though she seemed really desperate

197
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,050
said it needed to be small so she could

198
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,030
keep it close Amy is either extremely

199
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,290
lucky that this guy would say something

200
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,310
that would fit her narrative so

201
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,690
perfectly or she paid him to say this

202
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,970
also Amy's in Missouri might not buy a

203
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,320
gun legally pretending to be a

204
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,730
responsible citizen makes for a much

205
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,140
neater paper trail know that I'm

206
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,790
ultimately confused giving this scene is

207
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,470
sin but it appears the only reason Andy

208
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,850
was somehow allowed to sleep over at

209
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,380
Nick's sister's house is so we could see

210
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,760
her naked again and because he's the

211
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,500
biggest idiot who ever idiot a during

212
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,180
investigation like this I thought

213
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,260
writers hated clichés

214
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,030
where'd you get that idea have you seen

215
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,320
in the movies they're making these days

216
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,110
cable news is all over your shit Margo

217
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,330
has the fastest DVR on the planet I'm

218
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,220
going so easy on James forgot he's a

219
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,600
police officer who needs hard evidence

220
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,460
to arrest someone and not 30 minutes of

221
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,270
watching HLN

222
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,100
100

223
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,660
$17,000 in credit card for Amy's plan to

224
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,550
work nick has to absolutely never look

225
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,110
at credit card statements and never get

226
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,790
a call about extravagant charges even

227
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,380
though he and Amy were nearly flat broke

228
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,910
the statement tells us these charges are

229
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,070
60 days past due it's unreal he didn't

230
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,360
get a call about it even to discuss

231
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,250
possible for all she's pregnant did they

232
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,990
use the urine sample that Amy fished out

233
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,520
of the toilet that came from the woman

234
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,050
who was much further along than six

235
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,820
weeks which would show up in the test

236
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,259
results or the blood sample they

237
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,550
obtained from the crime scene that would

238
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,320
prove she actually isn't pregnant movie

239
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,759
expects me to believe Amy was able to

240
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,960
get all this stuff into her

241
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,580
sister-in-law's woodshed without anyone

242
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,139
noticing or getting it delivered to her

243
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,820
house without anyone noticing also if

244
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,080
someone delivered all this stuff there

245
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,250
would be a record of which carrier

246
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,870
delivered it and the cops would find and

247
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,210
question him or her also somehow Margot

248
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,470
shed was never searched during the

249
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,180
investigation or eaten walked into by

250
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,400
Margot herself also it's crazy the

251
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,110
timing of all this for whatever reason

252
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,970
Nick decided not to allow the detectives

253
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,650
to follow these anniversary clues which

254
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,880
would have led them to the shed of all

255
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
the stuff she bought to incriminate him

256
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,789
stuff he only found out about when the

257
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,169
detectives brought up the money troubles

258
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,210
and the credit card purchases to fake a

259
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,979
convincing murder you have to have

260
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,780
discipline in any crime documentary I've

261
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,310
ever seen the investigators seem to have

262
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,780
a habit of meticulously tracking the

263
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,220
victims moves and whereabouts leading up

264
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,150
to the time they go missing which

265
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,560
sometimes includes what they purchase

266
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,000
and what they want that being said no

267
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,530
one noticed the fact that Amy had been

268
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,940
buying murder related books and watching

269
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,979
murder documentaries on TV you need to

270
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:59,229
bleed a lot a lot a lot so much blood

271
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,940
that you would probably pass out and be

272
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,470
unable to stop the bleeding but let's

273
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,909
just say you succeed in losing that much

274
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,320
blood without killing yourself you will

275
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,820
definitely be too weak to finish staging

276
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,349
your crime scene burn it just the right

277
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,599
amount what is the right amount you

278
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,830
don't think anyone will wonder why the

279
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,360
incriminating diary isn't completely

280
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,220
burned you could have left this anywhere

281
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,479
in the house where Nick wouldn't find it

282
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,889
and accomplish the same thing instead

283
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,630
you raise more questions and went to the

284
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,919
beach I thought about our marriage I

285
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,510
came back and decided I wanted a divorce

286
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,430
by the time you got home she was gone

287
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,630
Nick leaves out the part when he goes to

288
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,610
the bar depending on how long he was at

289
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,050
the bar this could be a key part of his

290
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,729
alibi this trip to the bar might make

291
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,200
his timeline too short for him to have

292
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,729
enough time to murder Amy store her body

293
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,110
at a place that can't be found clean up

294
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,580
the mess and go to the bar all before

295
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,959
going back home calling the police

296
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,640
but I know she's not in makeup or

297
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,900
anything but if her face is plastered

298
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,250
all over the news there'd be at least

299
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,930
one asshole who would call and say they

300
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,160
think they saw her she's not in any

301
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,779
discernible disguise not wearing a wig

302
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,610
and still looks like Rosamund Pike for

303
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,200
whatever reason we needed to see Amy

304
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,230
scratching her leg

305
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,700
during a midday googling it stinks that

306
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,530
the find amazing Amy website has the

307
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,910
wrong hotline number on it from what I

308
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,710
can recall the number is actually 855

309
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,580
for Amy tips and before he kissed me he

310
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,940
leaned in and did Tess okay so this

311
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,070
maybe is a fake story that Amy decides

312
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,570
to tell the neighbor but the way it's

313
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,070
presented feels like the absolute truth

314
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,420
this is her actually learning about

315
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,340
Nick's mistress but why would Nick rub

316
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,960
her lips the same way when there's no

317
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,420
sugar to wipe off terrible what you mean

318
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,800
he didn't call first before he came out

319
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,220
here no no she is telling the perfect

320
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,020
story Tyler Perry's swooping in and

321
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,250
saying what I've been sending this whole

322
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,840
time is not what I need right now this

323
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,250
is the prequel to Batman V Superman

324
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,290
Batman V Wallace Keith's be sure to buy

325
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,760
Batman V Wallace Keef the penultimate

326
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,190
edition in stores soon I mean Amy at

327
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,960
this party guy carries around a picture

328
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,310
of the woman who ruined his life in his

329
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,810
wallet because he's a glutton for

330
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,490
punishment I see amy has finally decided

331
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,080
to cover up her appearance slightly but

332
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,850
come on by now she's been seen by so

333
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,680
many people right she just now started

334
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,180
doing this even though Greta has been

335
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,440
following the Amy story it doesn't

336
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,060
strike her that Nancy looks shockingly

337
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,160
similar to Amy it is absolutely insane

338
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,900
that Nick is left alone in this airport

339
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,000
with every TV playing Amy coverage kind

340
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,860
of weird TV show is this that ends at

341
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,270
8:50 Central Time

342
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,040
I'd like to report some strange activity

343
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,050
as soon as a call is placed police can

344
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,580
track where it originated so the fact

345
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,870
that no one thought to investigate the

346
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,430
origins of this call continues to prove

347
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,930
that Amy is the luckiest person ever

348
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,670
staged murder the treasure hunt is

349
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,740
critical she's taking us on a tour of my

350
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,570
infidelities Amy put clues in all the

351
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,400
places where he banged Andi but somehow

352
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,170
this dumb ass realized that's exactly

353
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,460
what the point was even though they're

354
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,170
all common places this also led him to

355
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,550
believe he shouldn't share these clues

356
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,260
with the detectives and it's what also

357
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,850
led to all this suddenly incriminating

358
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,410
evidence being left behind in all three

359
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,970
places stuff that would implicate a me

360
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,710
more than Nick in real investigation

361
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,540
this plan leads way too many things up

362
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,890
in the air to chance and even though I

363
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,480
believe Amy knows Nick enough to play

364
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,860
him like a fiddle I can't believe she

365
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,660
knows every last detail of how he'd act

366
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,250
during a missing wife investigation we

367
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,680
find a I've got to X Secret Service guys

368
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,120
that are really good I'll put them on it

369
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,710
well they aren't that good because they

370
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,850
don't find her nor are they able to

371
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,320
retrace her steps proving she staged

372
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,970
this whole thing Amy who meticulously

373
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,680
planned how to incriminate her husband

374
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,450
for murder carries around large wallets

375
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,920
of cash that easily fall out of her

376
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,020
jacket when she gets too excited oh you

377
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,880
said you were broke how did you know

378
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,440
that was money this shot here just shows

379
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,180
a bag with no money coming out of it and

380
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,350
it certainly doesn't look like the bag

381
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,790
is filled with money in any way

382
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,660
but it's apparently enough visual

383
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,280
evidence to get these thieves interested

384
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,240
in robbing her later why would you do

385
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,540
this huh

386
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,800
even though amy is suspicious and

387
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,210
anxious right now she still opens the

388
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,860
door for the drug addict girl from next

389
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,990
door say her name's Nancy you don't even

390
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,120
answer to it at the time you're hiding I

391
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,290
don't know why and I don't really care

392
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,060
can you not see who she looks like I

393
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,950
know you don't this is the number one

394
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,300
reason why Amy should never be able to

395
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,500
go out in public even without makeup

396
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,420
also why did she call this meeting with

397
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,400
desi at a freaking casino the news is on

398
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,590
and is audible in this casino sis Nancy

399
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,510
Grace surrogate lady always on TV or she

400
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,100
just conveniently on TV whenever any of

401
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,120
the characters in this film turn one off

402
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,110
even though there are security cameras

403
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,730
everywhere amy was unable to see that

404
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,990
desi was about to walk into the house

405
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,460
Nick's taking the back way to his

406
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,780
sister's house which reminds me

407
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,280
didn't Amy call about the woodshed like

408
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,690
a couple days ago well peek into that I

409
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,940
wonder Margo done this is a search

410
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,980
warrant for your property I usually more

411
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,080
tip line calls but a neighbor was

412
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,210
concerned about a strange man around

413
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,220
your woodshed and I continued ignoring

414
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,750
that gone for a couple of days until it

415
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,980
would be convenient for the story to

416
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,780
check into it now this was put here by

417
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,430
me which would be easy to prove if they

418
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,900
did any actual police work surrounding

419
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,370
that stuff instead of just assuming he

420
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,840
put it there and arresting it in her own

421
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,540
words this man may kill me that's kind

422
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,830
of convenient dammit he beat me to it

423
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,050
makes it two by four right big as a club

424
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,510
we found this day one the fireplace in

425
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,490
your home office just tested it fire

426
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,160
doesn't erase blood Nick oh come on you

427
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,660
found this day one and you didn't bother

428
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,820
to check in until just now you did she

429
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,290
cut her own hair like that I don't take

430
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,000
desi for her hairstylist so that only

431
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,590
leaves one option but based on the way

432
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,940
she cut her own hair the first time that

433
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,440
one option doesn't seem to be believable

434
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,720
either Amy stages a post rape scene for

435
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,950
the security cameras knowing the

436
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,450
authorities will view them after desi is

437
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,010
killed yet doesn't worry about the

438
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,780
footage those same cameras captured of

439
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,220
her willingly entering the house weeks

440
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,900
before Annie likes her face with her

441
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,340
bloodied hand and her face remains clean

442
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,170
the wounds are consistent with right the

443
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,090
doc doesn't continue and say also there

444
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,200
is no sign that she was pregnant and

445
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,640
miscarried because US doctors are able

446
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,920
to detect these things can't blame

447
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,750
yourself are all of the federal agents

448
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,490
cops and doctors in this room complete

449
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,800
morons she meticulously her words

450
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
staged the crime scene to look like

451
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,710
someone sloppily set up a murder scene

452
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,510
to look like a kidnapping and up until

453
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,160
now all these guys thought Nick killed

454
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,110
her with blunt force trauma because the

455
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,560
amount of blood and the murder

456
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,090
and they found yet no one is wondering

457
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,290
why she doesn't have any wounds that

458
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,640
even remotely come close to something

459
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,779
that would produce the amount of blood

460
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,900
Amy we found her diary it contains many

461
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,970
concerning allegations of mental and

462
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,880
physical abuse Wow now Amy is actively

463
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,020
avoiding parts of the narrative she

464
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,730
orchestrated that give NIC clear motives

465
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,260
to murder her and all these professional

466
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,150
investigators are still buying it and I

467
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,440
think like detective boney is being

468
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,420
ridiculous no more cameras everywhere

469
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,060
please find this the statement could be

470
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,560
potentially incriminating if any of

471
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,880
these federal agents knew how to do

472
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,680
their jobs I shouldn't ask you a whole

473
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,779
of the box cutter the other tide of all

474
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,730
time okay just be happy your wife is

475
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,589
home and safe I know James is an awful

476
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:54,330
detective but his superior boney is not

477
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,040
and this movie is going to gloss over

478
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,110
all the bull to allow me to be free I'm

479
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,600
sorry I feel myself fading well if she's

480
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,070
fading let's wheel her out of this room

481
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,660
and never be questioned to get that task

482
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,610
for Oh Ben Affleck really like showing

483
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,230
that ass doesn't he wait a minute

484
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,730
did they not wash off all this blood at

485
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,410
the hospital don't they do their tests

486
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,240
and then you know clean somebody up and

487
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,950
let them rest in what's more this blood

488
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,720
comes off like it's still wet apparently

489
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,130
Doogie Howser's blood is resistant to

490
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,720
the environment as simply looking for a

491
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,250
new host when it comes out of his body

492
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,260
sweetie did they both take a three-hour

493
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,570
long shower because it was midday when

494
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,560
they got in the shower and now it looks

495
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,630
like dusk In Touch magazine definitely

496
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,190
covers Nick and Amy Dunn's marriage but

497
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,839
is completely devoid of whatever gossip

498
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,010
there is about Ben Affleck and Jennifer

499
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,490
Garner

500
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,740
are you two animals about people I've

501
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,240
ever known since the guy who created

502
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,960
Madea she can't do anything we had a

503
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,820
national spotlight on us we stained the

504
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,560
rug conveniently this becomes a federal

505
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,060
case just because Bonnie made the wrong

506
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,589
arrest even though everyone in the world

507
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,089
thought Nick killed his wife but even

508
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,170
more conveniently even though does he

509
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,550
was mentioned during the investigation

510
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,900
nobody bothered to check his house or

511
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,490
the lake house during the entire scour

512
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,690
the countryside search which would

513
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,220
approved Amy's story total Bush had

514
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,580
noticed a disposal I have that you threw

515
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,860
it out the notice yes okay this is just

516
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,600
too much deviousness to think about so

517
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,459
many steps ahead Amy apparently threw

518
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,959
out the notice so that Nick would think

519
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,820
his sperm sample was disposed of but at

520
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,380
the time she was not thinking about her

521
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,150
pretend murder yet so what was the point

522
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,560
of making him believe the sample was

523
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,970
destroyed unless she somehow knew her

524
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,800
plan wasn't going to work and she'd need

525
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,029
it to keep the marriage going afterwards

526
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,279
you want to stay with her I guess if he

527
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,810
pulled a million dudes and confronted

528
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,160
them with a situation that Amy put her

529
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,390
husband through you've got at least one

530
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,400
guy probably more who'd stay in the sham

531
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,750
marriage just because there was a kid

532
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,310
involved but god damn it I'm not one of

533
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,300
those dudes there's no

534
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,410
way you could stay with a person like

535
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,770
this what I thought we were in the trust

536
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,250
tree within the nest are we not

537
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,470
you're daring me to be someone I don't

538
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,660
want to be so not like a regular mom I'm

539
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,900
a cool mom

540
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,399

I didn't kill my wife I don't care if

542
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,339
you want to see me again come down and

543
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,089
visit me in Florida I always believed it

544
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,120
was the things you don't choose that

545
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,060
makes you who you are you City your

550
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:28,110

551
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,600
advance last was this done routinely you

552
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,939

554

555
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
like six gummi bears and some scotch
