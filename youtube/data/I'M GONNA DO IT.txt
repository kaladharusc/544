13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,190

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:21,380
nice to meet you my name is John this is a great day and a good try to avoid

15
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,730
negativity on this blog but I hate hand station

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,870
it's the very worst that new york city has to offer I'd like to apologize to

17
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,540
out-of-towners about to experience this is just embarrassing disgusting

18
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,990
disgusting place that is penn station

19
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,910
here's how you cheat waiting in line for an Amtrak train look on the partners

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,050
there's my train no track listed you go down to arrivals

21
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,350
there's the same train track 12 then you go down this secret dirty staircase here

22
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,810
hey dude then you proceed down this tunnel that I cannot believe they let

23
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,450
regular people walk down

24
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,260
locate crack 12 you proceed down the upstairs and then you're the first one

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,260
on the train then you get a good seat

26
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:32,030
do is offer for a while this train ride about two and a half hours

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,460
things to take care of incredible

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,210
get the house ready for the storm turn around come straight back to New York

29
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,210

31
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,830
all right now I'm in New London just see my dad gave me a ride to my house

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,230
I don't think I've been in this thing that you haven't driven this car

33
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:26,430
I like with the basement flood know you just got to make sure there's water in a

34
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,269
furnace

35
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,450
oh no do anything to take just drink coffee

36
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,620

37
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,250

38
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:46,349
I well house is all buttoned up there is a storm something bad happens now

39
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,840
prepared taking the truck back the city case like you know things get here with

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
the snowstorm

41
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
it's good to have the jeep around thinking handle anything

42
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,239
anything will change on this portal back in the freeway

43
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:08,080
I don't know when the last time I did that was the guy doing the change places

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,410
like I haven't seen you in years since that time you crash your keeping the

45
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,849
lake

46
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,500
it's the city now I feel responsible feeling good

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,590
trucks running smoothly I've got changed in the back

48
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm prepared for just about any eventualities with this storm tomorrow

49
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,940
the verdict is still out as to how much go or if we're going to get snow or

50
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,900
what's going to happen

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,320
I'm feeling bullish though I would love nothing more than like two and a half

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,320
feet in the entire city of New York to be shut down

53
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,060
it feels like snow there's no snow yet but it feels like snow

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,720
i am back in the city in preparation for the snow tomorrow there are a couple of

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,400
things and pick up from the sporting goods store just to be a hundred and ten

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
percent prepared

57
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,080
I got knee pads i got gloves i can get everything I was missing

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,729
maybe

59
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:05,050
time for you to go to bed time for bed

60
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,749
time for bed all right what am I doing here so late at night

61
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,309
I they're forecasting like one of the worst storms ever to hit New York City

62
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:19,930
should that happen I want to be positioned to make like an amazing New

63
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,029
York City lizard movie if there's enough snow to make the movie

64
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,740
there's too much snow to do any prep so I'm preemptively organizing all of those

65
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,270
logistics now

66
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,569
so if i wake up and there's like 10 inches of snow ready to go

67
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:50,140
so far i have the 3-axis gimbal ready to go

68
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,360
I have one two three drones ready to go

69
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,980
they're predicting like 50 mile an hour winds so we probably won't be able to

70
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,470
fly the drone but I want to be ready just in case

71
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,510
got the fluid head tripod right here for nice like movement

72
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,240
I want to put chains on my truck so it's just ready and then I'm waiting for my

73
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,870
p.i.c so we can do some brainstorming that is p

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,440
I see but you knew that right

75
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,110
these are the change when you got 33 inch all terrain tires are lifted jeep

76
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,080
you don't really need things but if you're gonna do it you might as well

77
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,670
just go all the way

78
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,340
snowplow siding

79
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,340
the salt butter yeah

80
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,569
the salt spreaders

81
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,550
just spray salt everywhere when it hits the ankles it's so much pain

82
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,610
all right two important things to share number one it's snowing

83
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,849
number two I got the first of four tire chains on the truck check it out

84
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:10,439
yeah look at that with a chain or is it snap it about really skis how dope our

85
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,189
toes

86
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,849
you think doesn't work I they better be good

87
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:20,909
all right i got all four tires yes he has been helping by giving the deeper

88
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:21,659
face

89
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:26,729
it's very cute better get ready a little personality

90
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,050
we're leaving now I think this is like a wildly productive night we got a lot

91
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,530
done

92
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,420
yeah tomorrow is happening and that it passes what is too

93
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,380
come on why

94
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,260
why is Cinnabon always closed

95
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,250
always close
