WoahWicky of course, had the perfect response to this, in the most mature,

66
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:37,840
well-mannered way possible, which is what I expect from, such a high class character like WoahWicky. Let's watch!

Brilliant stuff, really good technique there.

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,300

Yes,

125
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,270

What I always wonder is... how do they monetize it? You know they're always flexing money,

127
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,820
Instagram doesn't really get you that money unless you do some sponsor deal,

128
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,980
It's not like you have ads on your photos,

Or, it doesn't matter if your video gets a lot of views.
