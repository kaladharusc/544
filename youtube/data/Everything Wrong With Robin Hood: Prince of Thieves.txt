2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,900
almost two full minutes of opening

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,790
credits set over a visual aid that would

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,110
make the original Beauty and the Beast

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,670
blush and this even came out the same

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,490
year poor Kevin Reynolds even this

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,529
bastard tombstone will read was finished

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,789
by Kevin Costner reading just like Errol

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:24,960
Flynn's version of this tale of

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,519
merriment and romance we begin of course

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,410
with a brutal scene of torture this is

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,380
English courage accent because that

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,300
stuff's apparently for suckers seriously

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,980
no one's pulled their hand back from the

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,670
chopping block

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,590
even bro flexibly daddy deliv got us

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,460
kill to eat otherwise we'd get along no

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,260
man deserves to die in there except for

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,219
all those other guys robbed and

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,230
immediately gave up on liberating but he

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,280
could have gotten the keys to the

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,870
shackles from the dead guards right and

23
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,800
even if he didn't have time to

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,539
personally unlock them he could have

25
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,489
tossed them to the prisoners right right

26
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,480
what if I say no

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,520
Robin has one yellow fruit in his left

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,050
hand here and two green ones in his

29
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,789
right but the next captures two yellow

30
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,949
fruits in his left arm oh also a movie I

31
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,899
probably wouldn't even notice or care if

32
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,159
you hadn't gone so far out of your way

33
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,960
to show them voraciously eating one of

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,130
these fruits a moment ago definitely

35
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,689
good we'll overcome

36
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,850
trust in that discount Orson Welles

37
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,890
seems awfully sure but also this is a

38
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,930
movie so yes I'm choosing to believe

39
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,090
that good will overcome Wow Robin's dad

40
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,799
just happens to be killed on the exact

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,360
same night he escaped prison after five

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,590
years what are the odds

43
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,450
nonsense everyone knows Snape wasn't

44
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,990
actually a Death Eater premature

45
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,119
celebration I cannot to dishonor them I

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,320
thought you'd say that

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,790
who the hell are these assholes that

48
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,259
agreed to this plan it's not like Robin

49
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,729
had any money to give them for capturing

50
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,409
Azim and even if he promised them some

51
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,790
were they gonna follow him all the way

52
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,740
to his estate also why does Robin have

53
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,180
such a boner for getting rid of Azim

54
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,470
anyway and why do it now

55
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,270
after you've come all the way to jolly

56
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,920
old England was a zine necessary to

57
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
navigate this journey by nightfall we

58
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,430
will celebrate with my father

60
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,040
many imagi resolved to me thanks to this

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,600
little plant don't make a Bill Cosby

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,189
joke don't make a bill cosby joke don't

63
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,630
make up dudes back in England for all of

64
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,040
50 seconds and he's already come across

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,659
the convenient England has got an evil

66
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,069
chase we're a bunch of knights tried to

67
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,489
kill a child wait that's your best plan

68
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,200
there are like six grown men here at

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,370
least one of whom has to be able to

70
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,140
climb a tree that a kid just scaled how

71
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,370
long would it take to cut this thick ass

72
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
tree down with a battle ax if you'd be

73
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,989
so kind as to give me your name before I

74
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,760
run yes sir he's Kevin Costner really

75
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,709
trying the British accent now it's like

76
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,780
20 minutes into the movie dude you don't

77
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,310
sound like you're from London you

78
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,170
traveled 10,000 miles to save my life

79
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,670
and leave me to be butchered even if

80
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,500
Robins being hyperbolic here that's way

81
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,220
the hell off

82
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,170
Jerusalem is barely 3,000 miles from the

83
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,400
middle of England and Robin was just

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
bragging about his geographical prowess

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,430
a couple minutes ago you whine like a

86
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,290
mule wow this is far ahead of Morgan

87
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,450
Freeman's ascension to godlike status he

88
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,980
is still better than this and I have to

89
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,330
sit in the movie for it and then it

90
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,250
wouldn't matter no point during that

91
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,720
encounter did Robin have a hood on it

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,519
looks like there may be a hood on his

93
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,050
cloak but you could just as easily have

94
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,700
called him a cloaked man all right guy

95
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,129
with a English accent whatever you were

96
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,569
just pissed that your cousin interrupted

97
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,010
your sexing this lady but the college

98
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,659
hunks hauling junk don't get any higher

99
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,980
for waltzing in here with a fucking

100
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,680
statue during boner time Yahtzee

101
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,599
question are the stray pieces of

102
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,370
eggshell part of the mystic recipe or

103
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,930
does the spell just not get ruined if

104
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,519
egg shells end up in the mix asking for

105
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,620
a friend also seriously what's the deal

106
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,030
with this movie what's the central idea

107
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,349
to take the Robin Hood mythology and

108
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,150
make it as grisly and gross as possible

109
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,650
even the Russell Crowe version wasn't

110
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,569
this gross and that was grimy so grimy

111
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,770
it even had Scott rhymes

112
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,550
man he haunts my dreams that's racist

113
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,270
no Skeletor also Costner enjoyed the put

114
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,710
the prisoner in a hanging metal cage and

115
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,390
leave them to die thing here so much he

116
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,160
reused it in Waterworld this is as good

117
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,050
of a spot as any to ask can we talk

118
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,310
about Kevin Costner's mullet in this

119
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,080
movie I know this was made in the 90s

120
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,910
when Billy Ray Cyrus walked the earth as

121
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,920
a star but who decided the mullet was

122
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,600
the de facto haircut for the hero of a

123
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,790
medieval epic did you believe in charges

124
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,030
even when they took my eyes so Duncan's

125
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,740
been living at the burndown castle since

126
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,990
las Lee died but how it's been around

127
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,760
for months since the sheriff attacked so

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,260
what has he been eating it's not like he

129
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,310
could even forage for food

130
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,740
my mother is blowing hospitality in this

131
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,270
country is as warm as the weather

132
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,160
and yet you're the best dressed for cold

133
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,660
weather of all three dudes in your birdy

134
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,040
almost like 40 percent of your lines

135
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,840
were lifted from a party jokes about the

136
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,280
British coffee table book next you'll be

137
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,390
ribbing Robin about calling his

138
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,670
apartment a flat or enjoying tea oh yeah

139
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,040
I am the maid Marion well then show

140
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,480
yourself child for we knew each other

141
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,240
well man what is up with his ruse Robin

142
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,620
said it's only been six years since he

143
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,210
and Peter left for the Crusades Mary

144
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,830
Elizabeth mastrantonio was in her early

145
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,840
30s when she played Marion sub Shana

146
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,280
spring chicken and wouldn't have been a

147
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,540
young child when Robin left and

148
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,130
apparently he was over here all the time

149
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,180
so it's not like she would have

150
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,190
forgotten his ass Marion like all maids

151
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,470
and 1168 I presume there's a combat

152
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,480
badass but Marion was just trying to

153
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,950
straight-up kill Robin just a second ago

154
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,630
now that she's got him incapacitated

155
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,460
she's just gonna stand there also I

156
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,870
probably should have just said Marion

157
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,700
his addictive Robin's balls you and my

158
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,050
brother are off playing boy heroes

159
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,970
Nottingham has plundered the show you

160
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,280
killed the hobbits running away while

161
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,750
struggling to act like you mean it has

162
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:12,400
found its poster child record scratch

163
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,770
hold the fuck up he burned her hair as a

164
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,260
kid man Robin of Loxley he's a

165
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,419
psychopath he's Tyrians bug smashing

166
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,670
cousin

167
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,860
in the 12th century it was common to

168
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,810
stack piles of hay everywhere because

169
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,310
you honestly never knew which wall you

170
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,750
were going to need to jump from suddenly

171
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,900
[Music]

172
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,710
they're already here

173
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,360
so is this supposed to make Guy of

174
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,490
Gisbourne want to kill them harder in

175
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,470
one move robbing is addictive horses and

176
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,420
stone walls

177
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,150
goddamn I love the score so much Michael

178
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,800
Kaman was the best and I'm gonna take

179
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,840
off a possum of synonyms honor shall

180
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,420
advise to taunt it master either we take

181
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,710
our chances with the ghost who become

182
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,130
ghosts ourselves Oh Kevin I think we've

183
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,720
established very early on the only

184
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,980
person in this movie who can beat this

185
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:03,140
overdramatic is Alan Rickman wait what

186
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,700
this is how Robin gets his Hood name

187
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,390
just from some guy screaming at him like

188
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,350
a weird man after Untouchables that's

189
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,450
two movies within four years were a bad

190
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,190
guys right-hand man taunt Kevin

191
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,480
Costner's character by telling him

192
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,950
someone he loved died squealing like a

193
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,460
stuck pig

194
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,720
this is like that thing about spider-man

195
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,940
movies mentioning branzino cannot be a

196
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,450
coincidence right will is definitely

197
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,860
singing the melody of pop goes the

198
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,570
weasel which wasn't written until the

199
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,480
mid 1850s so maybe more anachronistic

200
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,920
than Jesus on a cross reading a blog

201
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,370
article about black holes on an iPad

202
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,120
cross these are outlaws and refugees

203
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
from the evil reign of Nottingham in a

204
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,690
haunted forest most men don't enter and

205
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,940
they spend their days hiding along this

206
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,770
river at this very spot just in case

207
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,390
some asshole comes walking through here

208
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,310
who might have money they can demand as

209
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,690
a toll get the fuck out of here with

210
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,220
this shit just say you wanted a River

211
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,990
fight and be done with it it's gonna

212
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,780
cost you that gold medallion that is not

213
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,280
a gold medallion there is very little

214
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,170
gold colored metal on this thing no one

215
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,190
would look at this and call it a gold

216
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,340
medallion

217
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,900
if you English ever need a reason why we

218
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,550
think you talk weird just look to this

219
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,610
line alone for your answer

220
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,500
ya know rappin got lit up rolled off the

221
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,660
waterfall and downstream long before

222
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,160
Little John could even get out to this

223
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,140
rock no anyway he swam against a strong

224
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,760
current completely underwater and popped

225
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,380
out at the exact location to take John

226
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,060
out also for those of you scoring at

227
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,160
home and you know we are that's two nut

228
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,750
shots in the last 12 minutes Robin Hood

229
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,280
has roughly the same joke frequency as

230
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,860
an illumination movie at while hero

231
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,360
being offended a tiny bounty on her head

232
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,960
cliche I see the boy I knew

233
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
in the men before me okay let's talk

234
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,650
about the eight thing again kevin

235
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,270
costner was also no spring chicken at

236
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,100
this point in his mid to late 30s and

237
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,169
again it's only been six years since he

238
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,720
left so he should be easily identifiable

239
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,480
as an adult okay

240
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,270
[Music]

241
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,009
this is a great line so great that it

242
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,660
distracts the archers that are right

243
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,280
there from actually shooting that Robin

244
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,319
until he can respond then it begins I

245
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,000
can't wait until he foils the sheriff

246
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,620
and the climax of the movie and says he

247
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,330
rented the lesson calling back to this

248
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,620
fart where he pointed out the lessons

249
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,300
beginning movie totally yadda yadda is

250
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,770
how Robin got down from the roof of that

251
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,810
bill oh wait there's probably a big pile

252
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,639
of hay on the ground never mind I love

253
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,080
how Robin gets beyond the gate on a

254
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,639
horse and the chase is just over

255
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,680
where's boys it's not like we have any

256
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,300
horses that could write we do have

257
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,789
horses it's too late now discussion

258
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:28,720
about whether or not we had horses

259
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160
allowed him five more seconds of late

260
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,810
time making it useless to give chase

261
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,330
curses thankfully that's sack he grabbed

262
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,190
back in town to smack the gate guard and

263
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,990
the feast with had food in it he could

264
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,399
share with the Lost Boys of the hood

265
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,279
here instead of trash or dung or a bunch

266
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,140
of wadded up unused other burlap sacks

267
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,220
Tonka

268
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,260
breath here non this hilariously large

269
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,640
loaf of bread that could easily feed

270
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,440
several people in our community forget

271
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,029
yourself Ozzie my do not ask for your

272
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,279
company or council man well these do

273
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,779
just fuckin get it over with

274
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,520
well perhaps we could create a name for

275
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,890
him man look I love Michael Wincott and

276
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,630
he's awesome in this movie but the way

277
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,190
that he's shot is so disruptive Lee

278
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,630
close up that I'm about to vomit every

279
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,390
time he comes on screen now so keep the

280
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,029
stitches small but definitely don't wipe

281
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,500
off the blood or clean the area of the

282
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,750
wound first just stitch away as is you

283
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,370
twit the director said let's have your

284
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,899
character eat an apple not because we

285
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,190
need him to look like more of an asshole

286
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,480
he's doing fine at that

287
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,950
but because craft services bunch of

288
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,930
nitwits ordered a thousand apples

289
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,310
delivered to the set because they

290
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,329
thought we were filming that big horse

291
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,709
scene today but we're not so we're

292
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,000
trying to find creative ways to use the

293
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,709
apples before they go bad since we paid

294
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,329
for them up front there's your mate a

295
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,930
man they call little he died last winter

296
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,120
burn it down Wow Robin Hood Prince of

297
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,709
Thieves is basically Untouchables meets

298
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,300
the patriot and it's blowing my mind I

299
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,560
guess as long as they don't later pour

300
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,270
molten metal into revenge molds for

301
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,950
weaponization wait they do that to

302
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,860
village recently burned Wow just come to

303
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,270
the secret hideout in the haunted woods

304
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,860
that apparently everyone knows the way

305
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,390
to and no one is fooled by the haunted

306
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,540
stare a beacon here broadcasting on a

307
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,830
frequency everyone but Nottingham's

308
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,510
people can hear it's literally the most

309
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,610
commonly found unfindable place in all

310
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,140
of film history this is like half the

311
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,520
Gotham press walking into the Batcave

312
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
yelling Bruce Bruce question you brought

313
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,960
this misery on us Locksley it's nothing

314
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,790
I'm trying to divide us why not both

315
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,040
Wow would you look at that Robins a

316
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,630
crack shot with a bow and arrow it's not

317
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,920
weird at all that they waited over a

318
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,660
hour into the movie to show us that he

319
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,340
could do that how does his Eames curved

320
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,830
sword sheath work the swords skinnier at

321
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,150
the hilt than at the tip yet somehow

322
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,620
slides through this sheath that is also

323
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,750
skinnier at the hill legit exactly how

324
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,100
long this training session lasts the

325
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,330
movie doesn't say for good reason

326
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,710
because they train these clueless

327
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,150
farmers up to Kingsguard level in a

328
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,980
matter of hours instead of the years it

329
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,690
would really take even if I accept your

330
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,280
hyper speed blacksmithing which I do not

331
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,600
where did you assholes get all the route

332
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,070
metal to meltdown for these swords in

333
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,690
the first place cool shot and all but

334
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,370
we've seen what pains these villagers

335
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,410
take to make every single arrow so

336
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,090
Robins clearly being a dick here just to

337
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,050
show how accurate he is he's an outlaw

338
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,220
horse he rides

339
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:02,190
Robins wanted we reckon is me three to

340
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,670
four million in the last five I take

341
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,110
issue with the numbers here first of all

342
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,940
all five months even being generous

343
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,710
there's no way train that ambush army in

344
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,050
five months second three to four million

345
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,720
what pounds did the pound exist in 1168

346
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,600
three or four million in gold coins no

347
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,170
more merciful beheadings and call off

348
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,180
Christmas look I could do this in a

349
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,680
million places in this movie but if I

350
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,090
don't go ahead and take off a sin for

351
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,680
Alan Rickman's ridiculously good

352
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,090
performance I'm not gonna respect myself

353
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,670
in the morning do my room 10:30 tonight

354
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,660
you 10:45 bring a friend I guess the

355
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,400
joke is that nodding ham is overly horny

356
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,290
or that he has no stamina or that he

357
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,460
schedules meetings for his dick like a

358
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,750
secretary filling the day for her boss

359
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,250
if the movie would pick one lane for

360
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,630
this character I could maybe keep up

361
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,130
what's the purpose of this procession

362
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,540
I thought all of gisbourne's men were

363
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,340
scared of the forest and if they're on a

364
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,960
search for Robin why are they bringing

365
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,790
this massive amount of beer this works

366
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,040
and he's also not trampled to death on

367
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,699
accident

368
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,769
the hell is this crap l-'azim doesn't

369
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,209
even know who he killed in the carriage

370
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,889
and he could easily have killed Robin

371
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,089
there's a reason this scene wasn't in

372
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,829
the theatrical cut of the movie but why

373
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,720
was it shot at all for this well at

374
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,209
least I didn't use a spoon god damn this

375
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,949
is some cold ass to say to your cousin

376
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,869
before he dies like we know Nottingham's

377
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,639
a dick but this is some Jules Winnfield

378
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,949
double trash talk and for a forest where

379
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,439
no one went before Robin got here super

380
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,999
populated with tourists the hell is

381
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,109
Marian out here at all

382
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:27,759
Marian accidentally seeing naked Robin

383
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,799
swimming is not necessary she already

384
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,059
likes him and wants to help and this

385
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,139
nudity is long distance

386
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,639
who gets horny from nudity this far away

387
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,999
except for God yep you definitely could

388
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,290
have said you also could have taken them

389
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,579
to the main village and had them wait

390
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,959
we're really anywhere else in the forest

391
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,429
and they wouldn't have known what you

392
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,749
were doing but apparently there was such

393
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:45,579
a demand for hot Costner ass that we

394
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,129
needed to bring the women here

395
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,839
yeah wolf missed the target but he hit

396
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,549
this asshole in the neck if anything

397
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:53,339
that will kill him faster right

398
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,299
contribution to your cause dagger

399
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,889
shadowing how would Robin have gotten

400
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,389
down if Marian were here they're going

401
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,040
slowly enough that it's clearly balanced

402
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,899
just enough for the two of them so he

403
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:02,769
would have been hanging up there in

404
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,899
midair all I know is that our last words

405
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,359
in this world are spoken in anger now a

406
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,679
movie is cribbing from Field of Dreams

407
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,239
as well I'm legit starting to wonder if

408
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,619
Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is actually

409
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:13,029
not a movie but instead some sort of

410
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,589
super long term experiment on human

411
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:15,999
perception to discern when movies are

412
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,919
similar the same or just looking

413
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,410
identical men speak conveniently of love

414
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,879
I know right it's almost like there's no

415
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,980
love like your Allah and no other could

416
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:32,859
give more love no Prince of Thieves roll

417
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,869
of the credits your baby has not turned

418
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:37,089
Bonnie guard nag mother wisecracker and

419
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,429
Midwife Azim is literally the most

420
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:40,959
consistently surprising character in the

421
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,249
history of film no one will be seated

422
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:44,109
during the unnecessary and overly long

423
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:45,850
primitive c-section portion of the movie

424
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,079
I have this dance

425
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,149
Alice will Ben this whole time we've

426
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:50,889
seen every other villager in the montage

427
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,509
is in the group shots but he's just now

428
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,709
showing up to Mack on Robins lady yep

429
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:57,970
what we were definitely missing from the

430
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,679
theatrical version was the fleshing out

431
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,660
of the hiring the Celts to help out with

432
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,169
the Robin problem plotline of the movie

433
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,879
cat jump-scares are similarly in horror

434
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,589
movies and Kevin Costner movies they're

435
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,030
doubly sinful

436
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,520
I need you revised old Frank Christ even

437
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,900
the fucking horse knows how to get to

438
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,160
the secret camp in the Haunted Woods

439
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,650
this battle is literally 50% Braveheart

440
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,810
and 50% the Battle of Endor man if

441
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,920
someone could explain where these

442
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
characters are and how they teleport

443
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,100
from land to trees in the space of the

444
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,350
scene they deserve an honorary PhD my

445
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,960
god say hey why did not nm lead with the

446
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,030
fire attack it seems super useful the

447
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,230
main problem with the scene is that

448
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,970
they're in a goddamn forest and yet the

449
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,530
flaming arrows fly on target with no

450
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,300
impediment as to the wholly impractical

451
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,920
projectile shot from the catapults

452
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,600
despite you know being in the goddamn

453
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,350
forest fanny not only is this the most

454
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,760
convenient rope in the history of ropes

455
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,530
it also must be on a zipline or

456
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,820
something for Robin to get all the way

457
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,170
from where he was - right here

458
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,990
search your heart my child and while

459
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,980
you're there you might as well search

460
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:01,060
your soul and when you find me no more

461
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,250
this is a fine way to trick Marian into

462
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,810
thinking Robin is dead but how long did

463
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,980
you have to wait for the fires to burn

464
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,150
out before going back into the

465
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,530
battlefield and how long after that did

466
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,970
it take his ass to find this very

467
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,680
specific needle in a burned leaf

468
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,300
haystack God the idea that someone

469
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,340
lingered found that and knew it was

470
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,430
Robin's it's just infuriating among

471
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,060
these children to grow up as my allies

472
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,630
allows them to no choice

473
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,860
look God bent over the sheriff's

474
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,870
strategy a few times and I even started

475
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,190
doing oh let's talk about Nottingham's

476
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,750
plan sin but just about everything that

477
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,880
happens is logical and he does execute a

478
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,080
great plan with ruthless efficiency

479
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,210
which was all brought about by Robin's

480
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,980
request for Marian to write to Richard

481
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,720
so why do we have to include the double

482
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,940
worshipping and the ping witch and on my

483
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,570
screen movie ah just like Errol Flynn's

484
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,980
version of this tale of merriment and

485
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,930
romance we begin the final act of course

486
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,370
with a brutal scene of torture what I

487
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,810
want to know is you gonna finish what

488
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,940
you've started King will man isn't he a

489
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,440
little too old for this teen angst I

490
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,030
mean who even has that haircut in

491
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,920
medieval England our Father loves you

492
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,470
more than me makes everything more the

493
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,140
same what a stupid twist I have more

494
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,810
reason to hate you than anyone if you

495
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,360
say so like literally you are simply

496
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,430
saying so I guess I believe you I think

497
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,720
Duncan had it rougher than you the last

498
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,160
six months but what do I know we

499
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,450
finished this so let me get this

500
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:19,840
straight

501
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,700
Nottingham believe will when he said he

502
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,170
could get close to Robin lashed him if

503
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,379
you

504
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,479
then let him go without anyone following

505
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,009
him this is a dude who executed this

506
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,049
last plan flawlessly and this is a much

507
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,989
easier mission

508
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,399
we've only seen the principal since the

509
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,599
attack and we're definitely led to

510
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,589
believe that they were the only

511
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,660
survivors d'movie seriously just invent

512
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,459
a fanny granny to yada-yada the infant

513
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,899
being safe it's actually pretty clever

514
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,309
how they infiltrate the castle and

515
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:43,839
distribute the weapons and you can tell

516
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,429
this with wall plant but it also depends

517
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,720
on none of the town's folk to say

518
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,699
anything about the unusual like swords

519
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,499
dropping right out of the sky this movie

520
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,119
is big on moments and short on logic

521
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,769
that guy's going to either live to tell

522
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:54,879
about the outlaw who threw him off the

523
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,679
wall or he's dead and probably someone

524
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,179
saw him draw fur we'll discover his dead

525
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,769
body soon you're supposed to be sneaking

526
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,120
in here but oh well bring them out now a

527
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,889
last-minute execution rescue like

528
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,240
Pirates of the Caribbean man I've been

529
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,470
dogging this movie for how many other

530
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,850
movies it feels like but maybe this

531
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,990
movie just deserves some credit for

532
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,459
doing a bunch of cool that other movies

533
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,980
have been trying to copy for decades man

534
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,199
everyone was cross surfing in the 90s um

535
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,299
where's will and the last shot we see

536
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,679
that he's tied to the powder keg on the

537
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,149
left of the gallows but here he's

538
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:25,860
apparently either a free man or a ghost

539
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,299
what the castles under attack the

540
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,009
prisoners aren't going anywhere so maybe

541
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,570
have the executioner try and take out

542
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,399
some of the actual threat hey it's the

543
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,200
iconic shop from the movie poster but

544
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
this background fire was way smaller

545
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,720
just a second ago movie suddenly and

546
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,309
preposterous Lee becomes a lethal weapon

547
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,159
film King hey of course there was hey

548
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,409
there it's a everywhere in this universe

549
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,309
hey man pre-teen me love the inclusion

550
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,750
of a subtle f-bomb in a movie I could

551
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,759
watch but this sets the precedent for a

552
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,679
million pg-13 movies from Mission

553
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,419
Impossible fallout 2 ocean's 8 to

554
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:00,279
shoehorn in one of these just because

555
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,740
they can do you madyun of the house of

556
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,809
Dubois take this man to be your lawfully

557
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,389
wedded husband yes of course she does if

558
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:08,649
they're gonna play fast and loose with

559
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:10,120
the rules here when I go through this

560
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,559
exercise at all not like the bishop

561
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,379
hasn't lied before on the sheriff's back

562
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:16,600
it belonged to your father using the

563
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,980
same sword to kill the father and son

564
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,600
and or using dead father's sword to kill

565
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,940
son cliche man for a swordsman Robin

566
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,020

567
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,380
[Music]

568
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,700
Alan Rickman's the best but this debt

569
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,050
scene is straight out of a parody of

570
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,060
over dramatic death scene I would die

571
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,130
for you I mean she knows it's true

572
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:41,300

Scottish is Bryan Adams

576
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,480
because it's dull you twit

577
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,690
and crawl to freedom through 500 yards

578
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:07,810
of smelling foul as I can't even imagine

579
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,930
dagger I see before me nobody makes me

580
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,470
bleed my own blood deeper and deeper

581
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,800
into a state of complete relaxation

582
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,950
[Music]

583
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,860

585
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,660
