1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,420
My fellow bros,

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,240
my fellow brethren,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,060
my fellow comrades,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,400
the time has come for us to fight back.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,420
No more will we become

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,420
oppressed

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,460
by mainstream media.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,360
*slice*

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,720
No more will I take this online abuse

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,740
*slice slice ding*

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,680
and hatred.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,760
No more will I say &quot;I'm sorry. I messed up, okay?&quot;.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,840
ERGH *slice*

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,200
And you know why? 'Cause we're FAILING.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,080
Another Youtube channel is taking over—

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,200
*sees God's disappointment*

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,260
—is taking over.

18
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,200
That's right,

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,400
in no less than in November this year,

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,800
PewDiePie will not be the biggest channel on Youtube!

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,260
that'd be pretty nice actually—

22
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,160
NO.

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
We must fight BACK.

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,320
Who is this &quot;T-Series&quot; channel?

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,760
&quot;Oh, this channel will pass PewDiePie&quot;

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,240
&quot;pewdiepewdiepewdie—&quot;

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,040
SHHHTFFFFF

28
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,600
I'M NUMBER ONE! I'M NUMBER ONE.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,780
No more lame boxing matches,

30
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,240
I challenge T-Series to a saber fight,

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,740
like real men.

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm throwing my glove at you, T-Series.

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,600
Fight me, IRL, to the death.

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
No boxing glove and helmets;

35
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm talking about to the death here.

36
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,500
Wait they have 46 billion views?

37
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,880
It's an Indian channel?

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,880
IT'S AN INDIAN CHANNEL?

39
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,640
IT'S AN INDIAN CHANNEL?!

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
IT'S AN NRAHHHH!!

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,260
India, I will fight you ALL!

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,480
If you're an Indian watching this channel, you're welcome.

43
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,560
How many people live in India? How is this even possible?

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
Too many.

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,600
The only way I can stay relevant is to get the Indians subscribing to me.

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,760
If they won't accept my sword challenge, then the only thing we can do is fight fire with fire.

It's so good-

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,620
It took me a second the first time I saw it

64
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,900
and I'm like, &quot;wut do u mean?&quot;

65
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,800
&quot;I didn't see this video&quot;

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,500
like &quot;What's the context here?&quot;

67

I'm glad that their editing skills has improved.

72
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
Excuse me

73
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,960
Excuse

74
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
I had the same thing

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,380
I had 2 thumbnails prepared

76
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,680
and it was really annoying

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,280
I had to make one at last minute

78
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,300
What the heck guys?

79
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,700
Couldn't you have picked a winner?

80
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
You will gonna have a rematch anyway

81
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,980
Why make it a draw?

82
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,980
You clearly already planned for it

83
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,680
It would been more exciting

84
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,180
for someone to win to then get the title back

85
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,180
instead of a draw, no one cares

86
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,680

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,180

88
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,680
Fortnite did it

89
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,820
That's right everybody

90
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,540
I love how Epic Games did it

91
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Like genuinely its a great meme

92
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,140
Well done (Pewds proud like a parent to a kid)

93
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,640
I don't know why i'm like holding the standard that i hate Fortnite for some reason

94
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,480
When its clearly the (sarcastic) greatest game of all time at this point

95
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,840
Meme review is not Lwiay

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,660
Meme Review is not YLYL

97
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,660
All right this is all (not) correct

98
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,720
YLYL is not LWIAY

99
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,440
I mean its all memes (comes to realization)

100

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,780
Who goes through the comments [literally me] who's like~

164
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Pewds imitate board guy: This is pretty boring i guess i'll scroll down and see what's happening~ (Proceeds to laugh)

165
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,440
I guess I'll check out the comments

166
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,400
maybe I can engage in some discussion over here. (Pewds breaks character) What is wrong with you

167
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:55,220
&quot;I want Felix to explain why Brad sometimes flips the video and i also want to know which version is the real one and the mirrored one.&quot;

168
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
In today's SOCIETY!

169
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,480
Doesn't really matter what isn't real and what is it

170
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,140
What even matters anymore in general [Vbucks]

171
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,420
*Weird accent* Who am i?!

172
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
*inhales* OH MY GAH!!!

173
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right epic troll gotcha guys

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,460
*Weird celebratory dance*
Pewds: Yeah

178
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,940
(laughs) Goddamnit
Illusion: 100

179
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,080
Seems in today's society doesn't really matter what a replica is~

180
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,220
&quot;POINT PROVEN!!!*

181
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,380
*CLAPPING INTENSIFIES* (again)

182
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,320
&quot;I don't rate things that's not what i do&quot;

183
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,980
EXCUSE ME

184
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,300
EXCUSSEEEE!!!!

185
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,120
I like how Marzia made a face

186
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,940
*lil laf*

187
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,320
Is that Alan Waker wearingmyCykaBlyat (yes)

188
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,380

189
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,420
Legend. Absolute Madlad.
*claps 2x*

190
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,240
(calculating) Now if Alan Waker can give all his audience and subscribers to me

191
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,360
We can beat T-Series

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,100
That's right we gotta merge

193
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,460
The great war has started which side of history will you be on (The Legion)

194
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,720
Can Pews (really)

195
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,600
Good job (Disappointed like a parent to their kid) that's how you know your audience are bunch of 9 year old.

196
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,000
finallyry(?) review Fortnite as a meme, so it'll die off?

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,240
*claps 2x*

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,120
I've already done okay it can't be done all right.

199
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,700
Fortnite is indestructible theirs no point

200
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,200
[aw]

201
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,720
This is so sweet, Alexa don't play ANYthing cause even if I play a second of music they will COPYSTRIKE this video.

202
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,300
*silence*

203
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
That's what i thought you bihh

204
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,900
Speaking of which thank you so much Sony for the COPYSTRIKE

205
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,160
Really really appreciate it (dead inside)

206
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,300
It means nothing to me okay don't care whatsoever

207
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Go ahead

208
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Pewds impersonating Sony: You made a cover of Despacito we must shut this down now. (Idk who that is) is not making enough money we need to take the revenue from Poodiepah

209
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,060
I like that the Detroit: Become Human out of all games beacame the meme

210
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,720
There's always some game that's way too popular for its own good that always has some meme going on.

211
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
*Wait 4x*

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:09:27,140
*Hej Monika hell*
(While Pewds is talking in the background)

213
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,460
Pewds in distress: God, I'm physically disturbed
(That was actually an easy captioning thx for the person who uploaded this)

214
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,260
And aroused(?) at the same time

215
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,800
*claps* this is the power of the 9 year old army right here

216
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
This is library

217
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,820
So this is made by Ahti Vasser a fellow 9 year old (dosen't look like one tho)

218
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,180
Absolute Madlad

219
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,880
This is made in Febuary and i didn't see it

220
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,300
See this is why i love the Reddit you guy's bring attention to this cool stuff

221
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,340
All this epic things i can finally watch it you know.

222
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,780
&quot;WHEN YOU REALIZED THAT NEXT YEAR, PEWDIEPIE'S CHANNEL ITSELF WILL BE NINE YEAR OLD&quot;

223
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,260
OH MY GAH!!!

224
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,480
That's true and i wonder what's gonna happen when it turns 10
(10 MINUTE MARK I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE)

225
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
*smiles*

226
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,160
*laughs at the funny meme*

227
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,840
*And disappointed to self-reputation*

228
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,940
This is so true x2 Alexa~

229
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,500

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,180
*reads another meme*

232
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,760
What are you implying that just because leaching off memes and other people's content.

233
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,120
*Sad music plays*
As a desperate way to stay relavnet

234
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm somehow a reptile. That's weak
*drinks water like Mark Zuccerberg*

235
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,720
Would a reptile smile with such a human loving smile

236
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
