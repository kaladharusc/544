swimming pools here and I mean it's fine

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,780
I'm going back to Santa Monica but I

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,449

27

now 7-eleven apple fritters they're not

28
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,130
on my diet quite frankly they shouldn't

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,950
be on anyone's diet but I think this is

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,320
the most delicious food ever made is so

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,810
good

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:12,510

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,849
one and it was really good

38
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,200
well how old were you the first time you

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,330
flown a helicopter I was 23 years old

40
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,700
and when was that 16 hours ago the first

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,410
time I flew on a helicopter I was I

42
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,049
think like maybe thirty thirty and it

43
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,400
was with my kid I'm like it was like a

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,870
tourist thing weird to do a good tour

45
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,730
yeah but I've been obsessed with

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,319
helicopters since I was a little kid

47
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,150
it's one of my like it was one of my

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,829
bucket list dreams is to fly in

49
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,599
helicopters as often as possible

50
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,459
yeah and now you do it and I just want

51
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,640
them to know that it is still an

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,430
extraordinary experience for me every

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,200
time every time yeah I can't wait for my

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
number two experience it's a it's the

55
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,730
most amazing thing but it is get some of

that youngin it is one of the most

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,690
amazing experiences and it's something

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,420
that I appreciate wildly every time I

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,739
have the opportunity to do it and you

60
