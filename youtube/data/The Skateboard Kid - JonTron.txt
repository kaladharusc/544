1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:36,519
jontron

2
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,800
humanity's to longest-lasting

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,790
staples the child our legacy as a people

4
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,489
and the skateboard I think it was made

5
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,620
around the 80s and 90s it's been around

6
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,379
since then so it's time we finally bring

7
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,180
these two worlds together that's right

8
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,980
today we're watching the skateboard kid

9
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,260
the film with the famous tag line why

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,559
take the road when you can fly this film

11
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:05,899
was made in 1993 and features the voice

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,030
of the late Dom DeLuise it was the voice

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,250
of such characters as Jeremy from secret

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,679
of NIMH and Pizza the Hutt from

15
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,360
Spaceballs in this flick he voices a

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,520
character named rip so I said we're just

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,110
trying to drive the point home

18
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,640
all right let's quit wasting time and

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:29,020
watch this baby I caught that for real

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,030
Wow that's one flashy intro I can't wait

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,989
for what's to follow the skateboard kid

22
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:39,770
here we go featuring songs by the trash

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,539
kittens what is that like a kitten you

24
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:44,000
found in the trash either way great band

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,349
name guys hmm is that so yes it does

26
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,119
appear the back of that skateboard says

27
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:52,550
power why though why is this the first

28
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,360
shot of the movie

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,750
oh that's what I'm talking about right

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,370
there I remember when I rented out my

31
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,840
local laser tag for the night on my

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,550
birthday

33
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,210
let's rip I'm a pretty cool dude and

34
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,700
that's just a fact so what did they have

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,860
some sort of coordinated plan here

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,590
besides just skateboarding around you

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,730
look like he had something really

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,370
serious plans also skateboarding inside

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,840
all slowly like that is just

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,430
well it's impractical at best and it

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,400
just makes you look silly go and get

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,930
your wigs don't forget they skated away

43
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,790
okay so their master plan was just I

44
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,260
guess to mess with this guy who

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,790
literally just stands there and says the

46
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,130
words chicken wings over and over I mean

47
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,180
they must have planned it in advance

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,160
because this kid hooks up the police car

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,450
like he knows the police is gonna chase

50
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,709
them why don't they just pick another

51
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,250
target

52
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,480
you know like out of the cops

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,240
line-of-sight hey hey little chicken boy

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,310
first of all that insult could use some

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,560
work second of all the pain and

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,709
humiliation I feel daily are immense for

57
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,320
someone like you to cut someone like me

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,540
deeper well you must have problems

59
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,400
yourself buddy so I feel bad for you and

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,230
how fucking dare you say that to me I'm

61
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,850
gonna make you regret those goddamn

62
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,370
words so interspersed throughout the

63
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,050
movie are these strange shots of

64
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,150
skateboard tricks like all these shots

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,920
they coordinated with the airplanes I'm

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,959
assuming they just rolled up to LAX and

67
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,790
did this before the security showed up I

68
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,350
mean after tricks they do aren't even

69
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,730
that impressive they're just jumping

70
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,180
around like idiots

71
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,269
what's this song trying to say

72
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,560
skateboarder or perhaps this is a

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,269
tribute song for the life and times of a

74
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,610
man named Scott border

75
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,409
mr. borders gonna really appreciate this

76
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,920
I just feel it it's gonna be great

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,650
no creek you like clean air some

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,720
small-town values almost hitting a young

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
boy nonchalantly and pretending it

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,689
didn't happen I feel like in the real

81
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,549
shot that was just as dangerous as it

82
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,629
look how do you say dad yeah whatever

83
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,060

roll up to your car window dad oh my god

88
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,600

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,650
wearing that chicken mask while

90
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,430

104
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,919
something tells me they don't know too

105
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,470
much about Mill Creek there is a Mill

106
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,039
Creek

107
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,520
you know it's back that way really 40

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,169
miles down that way then you make her

109
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,090
right so was that a sarcastic answer I'm

110
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,729

111
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,060
oh no there it is it really is back that

112

way

113
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,789
so why was his answer so weird and then

114
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,380

115
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,260

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,810
looking for is staring you right in the

122
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,570
face well mom sure used to say a lot of

123
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,889
things that hold very little relevance

124
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,830
to most situations telling you I got a

125
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,110
good feeling about this place you'll see

126
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,800

127
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,210
oh yeah oh you think felt yeah whatever

128
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,430
you won't be needing that anyway you

129
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,870
just start her up

130
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,659
whoa a buddy listen grandma don't need

131
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,250
no help she's about to get out there

132
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,050
start tearing up some asphalt just clear

133
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,639
the way bye-bye

134
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,919
so now we meet this character Dan the

135
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,889
usual sleazy car salesman type

136
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,990
seriously he's not even doing it that

137
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,969
well this is like what I do at home when

138
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,199
I think no one's watching and I'm

139
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:42,419
pretending to be cool

140
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,000
91 degrees here at the end Mill Creek

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Wow

142
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,180
well you're just a real waste of fucking

143
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,870
human life aren't you so next we cut to

144
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,070
the kids from earlier messing with a

145
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:06,430
neighborhood girl a heart attacks

146
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,199
shut up ugly back pop snake Oh snake did

147
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,870
not expect that you startled him he's

148
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,020
like oh my god I'm sorry oh Christ

149
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,430
so I guess the implication is that the

150
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,440
father is doing poorly at his new job so

151
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,630
he was sent to direct a commercial but

152
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,849
isn't that like an upgrade I don't know

153
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,120

156
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,349

oh I'm serious did you break something

185
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,210

186
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,420
who are you it's not even obvious to the

187
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,800
audience what's going on here

188
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,930
how exactly has this kid Zack figured

189
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,850
out how to fix her anomalous electricity

190
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,310
situation the moment he met her oh my

191
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,440
god lady he's drinking your fish oh

192
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,300
you're just fine with him drinking your

193
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,520
pet fish oh that's funny to you that's a

194
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,180
joke

195
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,120
no reaction also this was what part of

196
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,790
the plan you did that first you went in

197
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,740
first thing you put her pet fish in the

198
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,120
drink first of all assuming that she

199
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,890
would be okay with the pet fish dying

200
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,780
and that he would drink this at all and

201
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,030
not see the fish and also when you broke

202
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,590
the glass with the rock how did you

203
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,330
replace the glass were you carrying an

204
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,720
extra glass with you to put on there

205
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,190
sometimes the thing you're looking for

206
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,290
is staring you right in the face

207
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,960
oh my god are you my ghost mom now what

208
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,750
can I do for you huh excuse me what did

209
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,760
you just say well I'm not gonna let my

210
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,410
hero get out of a place like this

211
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,510
without a reward cut it cut a quick cut

212
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,100
to film this is getting too weird wild

213
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,320
also two extra strange because she just

214
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,670
said thing his mom said

215
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,590
so since Zacks skateboard has been

216
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,330
broken by way of being delicately

217
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,700
punched in actual half she decides to

218
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,380
give him another one she has just lying

219
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:24,850
around watch attempts of decency boil

220
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,840
the other way maybe the hell what's that

221
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,980
supposed to be excuse me oh oh sorry

222
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,580
about that what's that supposed to be

223
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,790
this is crack once blocked the amazing

224
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,320
for Reedy yeah so then like immediately

225
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,850
after this scene there's a montage of

226
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,410
him cutting up a bunch of shit and

227
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,780
putting it on the skateboard why what

228
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,670
prompted this I mean shouldn't there be

229
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,350
a few scenes where the kids make fun of

230
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,700
it first or something to give him a

231
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,320
reason to work on it like I don't know

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,210
if one of them said wow that skateboard

233
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,280
looks pretty stupid objectively it looks

234
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,930
like some sort of clown board and then

235
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,790
Zack was like I'll show you I'll make

236
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,620
the best skateboard of all time and then

237
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll kill all of you and hide the bodies

238
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,860
I mean wait not that last part like he

239
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,540
literally even just goes and slaps a

240
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,310
motor to this thing out of nowhere for

241
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,960
no reason and it's not like it was

242
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,640
established that Zack was some sort of

243
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,200
whiz kid or anything like that he's just

244
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,850
a normal kid I mean we're talking about

245
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,070
the guy who has a hat that says Wow on

246
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:31,020
it okay you know what I don't need to

247
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,120
know about rummage time so Zack takes

248
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,740
his new skateboard out for a test run

249
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,850
when he runs into trouble with the

250
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:43,850
neighborhood gang then all of a sudden

251
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,630
Zach movin it's your turn to attack

252
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,690
what does a man do when halfway through

253
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,550
a movie a skateboard begins to speak

254
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,850
what does a man do then don't sweat it

255
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,820
these guys are Barney's so finally now

256
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,710
we know what Dom DeLuise had to do with

257
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,510
this monstrosity you didn't have to do

258
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,550
it done but forced you did you need a

259
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,750
paycheck don't get me started

260
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,260
Tyler oh yeah this is gonna be good

261
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,420
so now as if the movie wasn't confusing

262
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,250
enough before we got a wisecracking

263
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,080
skateboard from Brooklyn babbling

264
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,460
half-assedly like he took too many

265
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,820
percocet this morning it doesn't even

266
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,760
make any sense at least snakes got the

267
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,410
right idea though sit back eat a taco

268

269
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,490

270
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,620

271
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,820

uses to move stuff around did they just

289
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,680
use whatever they had in the garage when

290
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,750
they were designing this

291
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,630
grateful Wow this magical skateboard is

292
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,420
mildly impressive so as expected the

293
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,100
skateboard and the boy become friends in

294
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,290
a story as classic as The Jungle Book

295
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,420
and also as expected the dad is now a

296
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,520
clown major rock evader

297
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,730

308
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,730
God movies always do this if the

309
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,660
screenwriter doesn't know how to

310
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,730
manufacture meaningful drama it always

311
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,340

313
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,870
just a quick sum up the used car

314
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,820
salesman has a lot of money and tries to

315
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,470
woo the mother of this girl into

316
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,600
marrying him because if she does all her

317
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,010
mortgage and medical bills will be

318
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,020
magically taken care of she resists of

319
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,360
course because he's this guy got Frankie

320
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,710

321
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,750
even made his target with that throw is

322
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,000
it just mandatory to do things in a way

323
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,710
evolution did not account for to be a

324
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,230
cool skateboarder from the 90s yeah

325

metal in this see what happens so I'll

327
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,940

with the lady hiding over here in the

357
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,710
corner like some sort of abused

358
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,080
housewife and now the rivalry between

359
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,960
them is real okay though what can I do

360
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,180
for you it's about your mortgage radical

361
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,950
co-sign that damn loan so Dan the cowboy

362
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,990
finally convinces Maggie to marry him in

363
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,370
order for her to pay off her mortgage

364
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,140
and save her daughter Jenny is

365
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,970
reasonably upset at hearing this news so

366
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,470
the skateboard tells her jokes to make

367
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,070
her happy

368
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,350
flattery will get you everywhere I

369
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,250
couldn't agree more

370
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,770
it was like it was like closing the

371
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,240
greatest day with my life

372
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,300

373
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,820
that you're holding her mortgaging I

374
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,490

376

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,730

staring him right in the face the whole

421
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:16,879
time or at least it was staring other

422
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,619
people in the face but mainly if they

423
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:19,970
were looking at it upside down in a

424
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:26,360
mirror you really are my hero

425
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:35,559
