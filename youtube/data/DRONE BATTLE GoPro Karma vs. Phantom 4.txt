don't remember what kind of car it is

15
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,770

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,320
about my sister she's the nicest human

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
being on planet Earth but she gets super

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,080
super upset if you make her wait which

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,210
is totally fair you should never make

23
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,560
someone wait but on 6 minutes late

work I have a shoot later today but it's

42
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,330
a shoot where I'm like an actor I'm like

43
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,550
a character I'm like in it I'm not

44
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,930
shooting and I'm not directing it I'm

45
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,240
just in it and I can't talk about what

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,770
it is but it's something fun and awesome

47
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,540
and cool that you'll see soon enough but

48
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,890
I've got a little bit of time to kill

49
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,480
and I thought this would be a good time

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,600
to finally test out the GoPro karma

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,350
drone

52
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,880
I didn't bring my mavet because I drop

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,709
it in the river but I have my phantom 4

54
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,590
so I'm gonna test them head-to-head all

55
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,310
right here we go ahh surprised to see

56
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,690
you here what are you doing in Venice

57
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,150
man I was just something told me to be

58
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,049
here today I got the Phantom 4 and I got

59
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:22,860
the Karma

60
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,290
Karma's a virgin it's never been flown

61
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,900
before I want to do the same exact shot

62
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,700
with the Phantom 4 and then the same

63
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,830
exact shot with the Karma are we gonna

64
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,400
race by the way the drone Ferg's you've

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
seen already in today's vlog was on the

66
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,810
DJI not on the Karma

and completely fluent with it the GoPro

70
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,690
I've only flown once and it was under

71
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,020
the supervision of GoPro first time I'm

72
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,060
ever putting a first time I'm ever

73
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,270
putting drone blades on the Karma so it

74
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,190
has a black part on the top and a silver

75
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,500
part guys karma is the same process as

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,130
on the DJI so far I'm gonna fly the DJI

77
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,050
first because I just know how to do it

78
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,370
and there's less question marks

79
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,139
we've never flown a DJI before the

80
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,000
controller is pretty good it works

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,949
really well do you know what like the

82
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,539
rules are we allowed to fly drones down

83
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:23,120
here I've no idea probably nothing

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,200
okay so here you be cameraman man

the beach over the rocks over the

88
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,260
surfers and back landing the phantom

89
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,360
took some practice I'm very very good at

90
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,690
it

91
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,660
like a box without having really flown

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,970
it this controller is incredible look at

93
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,860
that no phone your nothing big fat

94
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,930
screen but if it doesn't work as well it

95
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,820
doesn't matter but it is nice feel that

96
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,640
pretty slow to boot up shoot cuz I

97
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,570

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
not using an automatic land feature that

115
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
was just me crash landing up enough oh

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,510
wait look we're missing a blade that's

117
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:15,470
enough good how did this get over here

it's hard this is not a conclusive

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,680

124
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,729
purely from an image quality perspective

125
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,129
I do think that GoPro is a better

126
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,250
picture than the Phantom for the DJI

127
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,289
flies better it's easier to control the

128
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,690
software is better but but in the

129
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,490
head-to-head just on image quality I

130
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,099
give it to go pro all around though I do

131
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,289
think that the Phantom 4 is too superior

132
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,709
for so I haven't seen Jerome here in a

133
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,050
long time and I convinced him to come

134
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,940
with me but we had the complete opposite

135
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,529
direction of his house and now I have to

136
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,200
drop him off somewhere so you can get an

137
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,510
uber I could thug you don't help any

138
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,640
more on this side I can't drive home

139
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,130

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:30,180
get kidnapped by Jerome

149
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,100
okay look at this place it looks like

150
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,860
I'm in the city right this is not a city

this is a god this is a Hollywood

152
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,580
backlot none of these buildings are real

153
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,780
like looking this looks like like that

154
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,820
no what would you call this this is like

155
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,760
the school right right here not a school

156
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,670
there's nothing in here at all

157
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,510
lost my skateboard this isn't a bank

158
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,480
right here and that's not a country

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
store back there and that's not a liquor

160
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,550
store and that's not a restaurant so

161
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,620
this do you hear that my camera focus is

162
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,780
off this is the back lot where the shoot

163
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,670
that I'm here for was shot

164
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,650
very cool production though I've never

165
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,450
had such free reign of a backlog I

166
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,340
