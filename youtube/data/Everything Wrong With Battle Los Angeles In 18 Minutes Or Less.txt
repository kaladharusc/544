1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,330
I'm getting your shower falling on it's

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,559
not an alien invasion movie without

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,089
hearing a cacophony of reporters at the

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,860
beginning of it I have one frame is

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,250
clear the world war oh good then we can

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,930
dust off our grainy battle stock footage

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,870
all breaches while long - coastline the

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,280
worst part about this alien attack is

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,570
all those Nebraskans sitting there

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,400
looking all smug this is the first of

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,110
many shots of military personnel who

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,370
have access to classified information

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,050
watching the news to see what's

14
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,800
happening massive casualties in New York

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,720
offensive lines are being set up in

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,940
Boston so are there no massive

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,710
casualties in Boston then it's a coastal

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,510
city - if they're already that's good at

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,980
repelling the alien threat I'd rather be

20
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,540
watching a movie called battle Boston

21
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,040
although I'm sure they find some way to

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,170
set the finale in Fenway is the title of

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,730
this movie battle Los Angeles with a

24
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,560
colon or the way it's shown here which

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,090
makes me think the movie is asking me to

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,500
battle Los Angeles leading the use of

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,090
California love and the action movie

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,530
would cause Tupac to roll over in his

29
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,449
grave if he were actually dead I would

30
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,600
say only as old as it feels outside so

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm worried about I can't feel a damn

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,829
thing because that mean this isn't an

33
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:14,420
idiom or a joke or turn a phrase

34
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,100
it's Nantz revealing an AJAX lie

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,600
community of pain what happened that

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,609
picture of us in Iraq with that camels I

37
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:20,569
mean your girlfriend

38
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:23,450
haha we are bonding you and I we make

39
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,340
insult of each other yes also that's

40
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,159
pretty racist I did my 20 I know when to

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,439
get out me another story about an almost

42
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,939
retired vet that's pulled into action on

43
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,380
his last days of work this movie should

44
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,939
just be called no Sin City for falling

45
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,979
down into hell or high water also seven

46
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,170
had to make some tough calls a mind

47
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,600
especially that last one we all wish

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,490
your men made it home there was a

49
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,020
scenario by which we didn't wish your

50
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,490
men made it home but that's a way

51
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,749
different movie with darker more

52
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,219
interesting exposition they got the rest

53
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,359
of them in a package deal but the

54
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,679
producers really only hired Aaron

55
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,329
Eckhart's chin but his movie Andy what

56
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,639
are you done in your balls tomorrow we

57
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,439
shop for cakes I don't care how close

58
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,270
these two dudes are what a Stavrou doing

59
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,649
shopping with Harris and his fiancee

60
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,179
this isn't like tagging along on a trip

61
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:03,529
to target they're shopping for wedding

62
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:05,749
flowers man this shot is so Peterburg I

63
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:06,889
thought for sure Peter Berg did this

64
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,049
movie but he didn't so why not choice of

65
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:10,489
director to emulate I've always wanted

66
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,290
to make movies like Peter Berg

67
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,180
yes girl is making a dude organizers

68
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,890
entire wedding two weeks before we

69
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,480
deploy movie thinks that if it gives

70
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,010
these short character introductions that

71
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,420
we're going to give to it's about them

72
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,680
once the battle los angeles starts

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,700
happening I'm sure this is a touching

74
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,170
moment but I'm too distracted by the way

75
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,159
they're shooting this like it's a voyeur

76
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,049
video to really care and now this guy

77
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:30,950
over here mr. LAN hey his mom's on so he

78
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,540
could join up to 17 thankfully

79
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,159
lance-corporal exposition is at this

80
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,450
party the guy just threw the rest of the

81
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,069
squadron hey did you like Independence

82
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,299
Day but wanted less interesting

83
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,769
characters in a super generic alien

84
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,420
Brett then if I got that movie for you

85
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,599
bringing it back to the company Mike I

86
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,190
need you they need one guy who just

87
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,940
basically retired

88
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,470
I know it's patriotic I think one man

89
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,090
can turn the tide in a war like this but

90
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,620
come on of course we know he's going to

91
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,609
make a difference because he's Aaron

92
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:53,030
Eckhart

93
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,349
but characters in this movie don't know

94
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,150
that sergeant Beck is being replaced by

95
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,370
Staff Sergeant Nantz later we find out

96
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,049
that Beck is on leave so I guess they

97
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,280
didn't need Beck on this mission even

98
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,810
though it's all hands on deck he's a

99
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,730
goddamn no-good gasps that's my grandpa

100
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,200
used to say pulling you up to squad

101
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,579
leader seriously I didn't get a bit

102
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,019
about these guys before but movie wants

103
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:09,920
me to keep up with these characters

104
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,500
promotions now we're being called in up

105
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,920
one evacuation center these meteors

106
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,419
assume so I realize that not every

107
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,799
officer is briefed on the details of the

108
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,299
mission shouldn't Martinez have some

109
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,099
idea about why he was called in the

110
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,810
central object are all the same

111
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,329
geometric state we appear mechanical in

112
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,160
nature they're almost like I don't know

113
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,379
battleships of some sort directed a year

114
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,810
later by holy Peter Burke how that

115
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,060
situation what I've been training for I

116
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,620
certainly hope so if they made you

117
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,970
lieutenant I hope it's not because

118
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,319
you've been training for fry cook at

119
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,940
McDonald's there are people in reporters

120
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,379
hanging out on a beach where a meteor is

121
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:43,250
about to hit the ocean

122
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,169
look I know people are stupid but this

123
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,609
malfunctioning camera is able to self

124
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,079
edit and get extreme close-ups of the

125
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,519
victims in this attack I know it's good

126
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,230
television but these are fucking Marines

127
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,519
you'd think they'd be standing there

128
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:53,629
with their dicks in their hands watching

129
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,310
TV they were just told to move out even

130
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,629
though all these soldiers are getting to

131
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,980
see an unfiltered look at the invasion

132
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,599
the movie decides to go with this wildly

133
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,129
cut found footage route cutting in

134
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,750
soldiers reactions and really when it

135
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,190
comes down to it making the movie a mess

136
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,940
and pissing me off

137
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,370
yaaaas PFC lenin was our second best

138
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,260
marksman just behind Lance Corporal

139
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,150
Guerrero um this information is

140
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,560
virtually worthless is there a scenario

141
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,060
by which you wouldn't have your first

142
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,500
and second best marksman on this mission

143
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,849
and if they weren't coming doesn't

144
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:17,930
somebody else become the first and

145
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,310
second best marksman in their place and

146
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,599
why would you lead your discussion with

147
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,469
the best marksman

148
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,669
I feel like this was just a worthless

149
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,020
way of saying we've got some guys or

150
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,530
greated shooting on this team

151
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,690
right already now Sergeant Nantz will be

152
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,370
taking over the staff side effects

153
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,260
because Staff Sergeant Beck is a piece

154
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,730
of dickless whore bitch is my kid

155
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,990
brother used to say in kindergarten you

156
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,520
got a Silver Star my brother came home

157
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,200
in a box feel like this is a very good

158
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,490
reason why Aaron Eckhart shouldn't be on

159
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,160
this particular team and Roll Creek

160
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,410
sorry it's been a long week I can

161
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,850
understand why a marine would be reading

162
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,230
the Bible before going into battle but

163
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,760
this Bible is hilariously over

164
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,350
diagrammed he has the word for in

165
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,760
parentheses has marked out most of the

166
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
pronouns for some reason and is

167
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280

176
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,100
camerawork was a little too steady most

177
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,510
the Santa Monica has been clear to

178
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,669

180
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,640
including tourists and people who wanted

181
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,690
to look at the meteor shower they

182
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,729

fighters to Saving Private Ryan through

189
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,310

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,660
quick air support it must be a

191
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,190
metaphorical bomb drop for it to be in

192
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,110
quotes like this like really it's an

193

insult comic coming to the scene to spit

194

racial slurs at the aliens affiliate

quarter-mile away but just got real

205
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,370
quiet because we need some manufacturer

206

207
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,669
the world is at war the radio is still

208

215
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,289
time-sensitive mission to learn this

216
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,180
dog's name I'm sure it's a good dog but

217
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,650
if I were in this group that dog can go

218
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,100
to hell

219
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,330
you want calm man this movie's got a

220
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,070
long time without a jump scare cliche so

221
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,030
maybe I should take officer motherfucker

222
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,020
[Music]

223
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,130
everything these shots and this editing

224
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,750
represents these aliens were trained at

225
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,310
the finest stormtrooper school of aiming

226
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:36,910
guns

227
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,130
yelling aliens excitement and it's a

228
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,750
great thing that every interior room in

229
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,520
this movie has an expositional TV that's

230
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,930
not only working but has an excellent

231
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,400
cable connection hello how every single

232
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,169
shot of news in this movie also has to

233
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,639
show you how badly the Dow Jones is

234
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,810
doing during the middle of this alien

235
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,259
invasion

236
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,050
what night anybody got eyes on earth oh

237
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,610
no one of the thirty guys from the

238
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,900
squadron that we were introduced to a

239
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,560
few minutes ago not him washing machine

240
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,910
buzzes for no goddamn reason

241
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,320
well them to be a jump-scare unless

242
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,460
someone decided they needed to put a

243
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,710
wash in during the alien invasion look I

244
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,180
understand Lenihan is freaked out in the

245
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,039
wood but this is a trained soldier that

246
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
should never leave cover for a wide-open

247
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,310
space like this I guess the movie was

248
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,990
finally ready to show something aliens a

249
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,030
little alien is alone does that mean

250
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,090
that he's an alien or alone Ian help me

251
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,000
out here guys

252
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,220
scaring ball also say Leon had the

253
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,870
element of surprise at point-blank range

254
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,370
this point I wonder if the aliens are

255
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,070
actively trying to miss streets clear so

256
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,930
everyone's generally okay that they

257
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,400
survived a precision attack that

258
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,720
included an ambush from high ground

259
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,159
we're all back together with an UP

260
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,389
health and ammo to continue the mission

261
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,909
I mean simply but it's also kind of

262
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,210
Awesome you that's a us a tech sergeant

263
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,310
uh Lana Santos air force after Linda

264
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,080
Hamilton has her 50s all badass female

265
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,520
roles in Hollywood were automatically

266
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,190
assigned to Michelle Rodriguez okay vote

267
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,620
about 25 minutes first off can you be a

268
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,940
little more specific wouldn't want to

269
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,590
know the exact time left before the

270
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,300
rescue helicopter arrives also ten

271
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,490
minutes ago random arena before Yelp so

272
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,930
I'd synchronize those swatches if I were

273
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,690
you my spot whoa wait the optimal

274
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,220
signaling of the choppers to throw more

275
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,229
smoke out there what about like a flare

276
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,210
or something yeah the smokes blue but

277
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,630
it's already smokey around here right

278
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,800
the Marines consider the most

279
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,419
comfortable introduction to civilian is

280
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,740
to scream loudly while pointing a rifle

281
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,370
at them

282
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,960
it's an Emmanuel and everything will be

283
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,610
introduces Michelle Rodriguez Michael

284
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,110
Pena and Bridget Moynahan at the

285
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,430
40-minute mark these secondary

286
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,900
characters are played by actors so

287
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,490
famous there's a really good chance that

288
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,870
Tom Brady one of these people in his

289
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,240
lifetime officials are now saying any

290
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,969
civilian within 10 miles of the coast to

291
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,650
try to make their way to fulfill its

292
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,020
very Forward Operating Base book heirs

293
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,909
but Dow Jones is under five Alvin now

294
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,950
we're doomed that one our promise

295
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,079
legally so now they got leadership yep

296
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:48,700
we can definitely assume a clear chain

297
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,290
of alien command by the location of this

298
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,180
one alien butthole when you invade a

299
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,180
place for its resources you wipe out the

300
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,800
indigenous population those are the

301
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,360
rules of any colonization

302
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,040
luckily CNN was able to get doctormick

303
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,870
alien colonization on air in perfect

304
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,760
time for some global exposition we have

305
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,740
a situation

306
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,150
y'all need to follow me is there ever a

307
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,589
time when this type of dialogue is more

308
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,150
useful than just telling people what was

309
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,959
going on damn it

310
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,430
this movie had consensual promise but

311
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,079
now it's just burning out cliche after

312
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,850
cliche we need to know exactly where to

313
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,730
hit this thing maybe I can help I'm a

314
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,430
veterinarian

315
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,140
there's no frontal lobe no temporal lobe

316
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,579
no parietal lobe you can already tell

317
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,440
the alien doesn't have those things just

318
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,829
open this up five seconds ago right this

319
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:31,630
is our last shot hopefully all the

320
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,949
aliens you encounter will be half dead

321
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,390
and you can tear them open at will to

322
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,970
get to their hearts it's nice and I know

323
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,260
this because it's not making that Star

324
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,730
Wars podracer sound effect anymore

325
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,560
that's how we chill just to the right

326
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,120
where the heart would be Jesus how did

327
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,620
you figure that out so quickly how are

328
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,910
you supposed to aim right of the heart

329
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,529
when they all have that protection that

330
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,089
one dude shot the alien by the pool over

331
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,650
a hundred times and he apparently missed

332
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,270
that spot because they came back out of

333
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,740
the water like Jason the first Friday

334
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,990
the 13th movie I got three more you can

335
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,699
also explode the aliens to death so no

336
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,209
need to worry about their weak spot I

337
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,380
don't know how this bus is supposed to

338
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,000
drive through roads and avoid aliens

339
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,380
when we've seen all the roads are like

340
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,000
parking lots at this point ha

341
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,350
turn off that radio to tracking our

342
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,690
tables turn up okay fine the aliens are

343
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,100
tracking their signals but why haven't

344
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,810
they destroyed satellites carrying CNN

345
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,760
and of course HBO wouldn't this invasion

346
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,140
go down better without an informed

347
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,510
public or do the aliens think CNN is

348
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,250
fake news alien ship decides not to

349
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,140
destroy this bus because hey they might

350
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,700
need that later for parties

351
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,830
look it's ridiculously made that perfect

352
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,390
of a grenade throw but I'm really more

353
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,040
annoyed by how close these ships already

354
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
get to the gas pump with open flames on

355
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,550
their thrusters but they don't at night

356
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,530
man survives us only choice take the

357
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,630
freeway and be sure to keep it about 50

358
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,180
miles an hour for God's sake check off

359
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,040
in case you didn't know from the 17

360
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,630
other instances in this movie lieutenant

361
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,980
Martinez is the one in charge

362
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,750
despite Staff Sergeant Nantz having more

363
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,670
experience it's never been one conflict

364
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,990
surrounding this other than the brief

365
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,640
exchange at the beginning also why would

366
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,380
the freeway not also be completely

367
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,240
blocked this is mother Los Angeles

368
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,620
freeways packed at 3:00 a.m. on a

369
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,300
Tuesday but open during an alien

370
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,370
invasion well ain't this squadron a

371
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,110
temporal oddity 25 minutes away from

372
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,740
everything

373
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,300
lundi saves money by telling the

374
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,740
assistant director to go to any la

375
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,090
freeway you can think of right now to

376
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,070
get footage of burning cars it was kind

377
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,750
of the doomed la drivers to form a

378
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,280
decent path for this boss before they

379
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,260
died hang on I have a headed west

380
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,880
they were just in Santa Monica on 10th

381
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,320
Street so either they're headed straight

382
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,850
into the ocean which is the exact

383
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,440
opposite of safety or they're going to

384
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
the Santa Monica Airport which is only

385
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,980
west in opposite world hell are you

386
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,110
doing you guys need another gun way to

387
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,760
go Michelle Rodriguez I mean why would

388
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,350
there ever be a reason for somebody not

389
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,640
to be helping right now unless you're

390
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,020
that guy from hacksaw Richard are you

391
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,550
seeing bullets hitting the right side of

392
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,720
where the heart should be because I

393
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,140
don't

394
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,180
yeah we're winning no doubt that this is

395
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,920
some powerful weapon here but it looks

396
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,630
cumbersome you have to push this thing

397
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,280
down the street why isn't this a vehicle

398
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,630
this thing is more awkward than the

399
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,220
walkers and Empire Strikes Back how many

400
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,610
go

401
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,040
toad outside wonder girl honestly this

402
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,330
action scene has been cut to death so

403
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,800
much he could have said any number and

404
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,120
I'd have no choice but believe him

405
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
with all this going on I am reminded

406
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,670
that they needed to get out of the area

407
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,100
in 25 minutes and while only 6 minutes

408
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,870
have passed since then this battle has

409
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,520
really gone on for way longer and the

410
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,200
bomb should already be dropping unless

411
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,430
you're saying what we're watching is

412
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,110
real time which means you turn the tide

413
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,820
against an alien force in 6 minutes and

414
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,540
that simple seriously how is this any

415
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,950
different from shooting the alien by the

416
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,180
pool earlier you're telling me this guy

417
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,279
I missed but John cube civilian was able

418
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,180
to knock one out with a couple of

419
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,350
bullets and I know they know where to

420
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,790
shoot now it's basically no different

421
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,110
from what happened to the pool alien

422
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,650
that kept surviving all the bullets Oh

423
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,240
daddy is trying hard to make me care

424
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,650
about Nancy's backstory instead of

425
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,630
focusing on aliens blowing stuff this is

426
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,790
instead of water martini echo company

427
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,540
second Battalion fifth Marines ooh-rah

428
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,040
ok this movie doesn't look like a

429
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,140
typical alien invasion or war movie so I

430
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,700
had higher hopes than seeing a bland

431
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,010
generic cliche fest but it's totally

432
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,300
generic right down to the officer

433
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,800
sacrifices himself to kill the baddies

434
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,660
and save the unit cliche and since it

435
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,010
fooled my ass into thinking it might be

436
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,390
different I'm going to add 10 more sins

437
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,040
for the subterfuge the fact that Bridget

438
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,570
Moynahan character's name Michelle and

439
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,100
the idea that michelle monaghan could

440
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,180
have taken her place halfway through the

441
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,800
movie without me noticing is much more

442
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,030
entertaining than watching this movie

443
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,920
still half a click inside the bombing

444
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,450
zone can you believe that only took 10

445
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,760
minutes felt like more did it raw

446
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
did you just lead to lieutenant back

447
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,060
here to die you look that way even

448
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,470
though everyone's going to die and oh

449
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,630
probably 25 minutes or so Marines again

450
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,130
waste time speculating on Nancy's

451
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,830
backstory looting we're estimating with

452
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,770
26 17 countries are now in full attack

453
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,510
but our cable operations in these cities

454
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,700
remain remarkably intact I know we can't

455
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,210
believe it either

456
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,910
yeah we wipe it up we take out their

457
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,830
haiyan's have one main ship that

458
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,660
controls everything cliche aliens run

459
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,490
the same playbook as vampires kill the

460
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,110
head vampire they all died nobody in

461
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,730
this advanced alien race ever heard of

462
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,080
not putting your larvae all in one

463
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,959
basket hey that's your to drop yeah if

464
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,520
the bombs didn't drop at the immediate

465
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,050
moment to which you had your watch's

466
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,279
time then they aren't going to drop the

467
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,990
bombs I understand the military at least

468
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,880
tries to be precise but come on it could

469
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,110
be a minute or two late right

470
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,480
right one alternate extraction site is

471
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,160
still operational according to this map

472
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,780
that may not be accurate anymore due to

473
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,940
the passage of time mr. Rincon is dead

474
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,610
oh no it's sad that guy was so Michael

475
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,400
Pena

476
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,839
so much to see people who exhibit the

477
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,150
properties of Michel Pina die I got any

478
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,520
brain for the others because we range

479
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,470
don't luckily for the morale of the

480
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,970
squadron this emotional Michael Bay

481
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,500
asked mine along takes place at a time

482
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,480
when no Marines or otherwise marina you

483
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,010
getting us out to staff Sarge

484
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,380
or are we expended we interrupt this

485
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,180
alien invasion military movie to bring

486
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,010
you a very special episode of mash that

487
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,950
dead I'm here like a punchline some bad

488
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,200
joke is that the punchline to any joke

489
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,380
you have eleven passengers requesting

490
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,760
evacuation at alternate extraction point

491
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,680
Charlie the aliens were monitoring the

492
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,300
radio signals early in the movie but I

493
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,650
guess they got bored and stop listening

494
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,790
to these fools discuss the alternative

495
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,950
extraction point over the open airwaves

496
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,600
unless you ever see what I push back and

497
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,820
saying God you do huh yes that such a

498
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,860
fully loaded weaponized vehicle was left

499
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,870
behind on this SOB alien raid even

500
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,339
though they killed every motherfucker on

501
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:57,990
the base even aliens haven't evolved

502
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,980
enough to realize that they need to

503
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,960
shoot the goddamn tire strange but none

504
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,550
of the aliens have one of those Imperial

505
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,750
Walker things they have back at the

506
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,250
bridge seem to be fairly useful

507
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,690
technology that they forgot when they

508
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,790
set up the space got that nasty stuff

509
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,850
all over my mouth man buddy if you know

510
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm doing any fire today Michael Vania

511
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,410
is dead let's get home and buy home I

512
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,940
mean some military base where we'll stay

513
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,560
temporarily until the aliens decide to

514
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,290
attack inlet

515
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,270
the taxes are just talking I and the

516
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,370
traffic is a nightmare the latter for

517
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,830
Martinez is why will you get it sooner I

518
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,450
thought after Martinez died I might have

519
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,770
a chance with her now I just want her to

520
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,240
know how I feel oh wait that's

521
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,210
Martinez's letter isn't it

522
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,070
there wasn't one bit of suspense to this

523
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,660
scene now the actions going into

524
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,400
hyperdrive and it's dark the editor has

525
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,960
film cuts all over his hands from all

526
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,310
the cutting is doing even though the

527
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,900
footage is probably digital the camera

528
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,250
operator drank 10 shots of Red Bull

529
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,020
cappuccino latte and the director stayed

530
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,340
home with an illness during the shooting

531
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,140
this scene also still isn't really part

532
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,850
of these alien quads game they've just

533
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,200
been blasting fools left and right but

534
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,910
here they're able to sneak up right on a

535
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,840
gang of highly trained military

536
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,730
personnel without a PA lien command

537
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,840
center conveniently pokes its head

538
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,580
outside over the street so the good guys

539
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,050
will be able to kill it easier I mean

540
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,310
seriously they went to the trouble of

541
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,660
putting this thing underground but left

542
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,280
a wide-open hole and couldn't even fit

543
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,020
the entire thing down there right over

544
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,240
this command asset which is completely

545
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,370
unguarded above ground also I really

546
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,570
don't know if they were in the sewers

547
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,520
long enough for night to become day you

548
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,780
don't know either and I bet you ten

549
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,370
dollars movie doesn't know right at

550
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,590
heart right right of the aw I'm pretty

551
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,060
sure you already knew that considering

552
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,620
you were there when Nan's made that

553
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,240
discovery I feel like this is a reminder

554
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,010
to the audience or it might have been a

555
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,390
note left in the margins by the

556
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,770
screenwriter to remind the director

557
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,480
about some day totally been glossing

558
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,220
over until now also this how to kill an

559
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,020
alien detail but seem super important of

560
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,430
the plot earlier hasn't been used once

561
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,260
until this moment all the aliens fire

562
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,940
their usual guns when we've seen them

563
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,200
use much better tech throughout the

564
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,790
movie they probably know it's the end so

565
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,170
they gave up on doing anything smarter

566
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,880
skillful you know what all the action in

567
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,020
this movie is the fitting of the

568
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,520
director who gave us the Texas Chainsaw

569
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,170
Massacre the beginning wrath of the

570
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,700
Titans and Earth's remake of Teenage

571
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,360
Mutant Ninja Turtles that's how these

572
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,070
assholes prematurely celebrate so much

573
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,020
they should work for NASA advanced alien

574
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,460
weapons somehow keep missing the easy

575
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,260
target with a pinga laser coming out of

576
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,460
it even though the missile was in the

577
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,510
area and the soldiers on the ground

578
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,190
notice it coming in and it took forever

579
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,720
to get that laser pointed at the alien

580
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,350
ship this missile still gets its target

581
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,700
killed my brother I mean now if you

582
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,860
sharlinda jaws anymore yeah but there

583
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,390
was a ton of those big soldiers on the

584
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,680
ground and I did plenty of them are

585
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,600
still around this area alone also they

586
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,950
only took out the one command center in

587
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,630
Los Angeles so I assume they'll have two

588
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,340
independent say the method of victory to

589
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,200
the other countries via Morse code me

590
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,970
dance is already using his pistol here

591
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,770
which should be hilariously incompetent

592
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,600
in this fight by the way but is shown

593
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,980
abandoning his rifle in the next shot

594
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,230
then going to the pistol realizing aaron

595
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,520
eckhart didn't look badly enough in the

596
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,110
last close up the makeup department went

597
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,520
with the dirt and blood bukkake look for

598
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,020
the flight back to base why now you

599
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,690
brought their shift

600
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,940
it's gone out to every army in every

601
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,100
city so they do will have to find the

602
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,870
command center and hope that a big piece

603
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,100
of it is hanging out in broad daylight

604
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,570
and that bombing it will cause the

605
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,770
command center to start flying out in

606
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,910
the open and then the soldiers in the

607
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,170
ground will also have to get very lucky

608
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,360
to point a laser just so I mean it's a

609
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:16,200
piece of cake really

610
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,269
[Music]

611
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,700
it was bad start

612
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,840
promise me you won't let me be taken

613
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,429
alive by some gossip reading from

614
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,710
another world bad but no promises in

615
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,499
combat you either die a hero or you live

616
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,879
long enough to see yourself become the

617
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:39,059
villain had to make some tough calls mi

618
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,230
do mainly you will have to be not

619

I saw this in a movie about a but that

622
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,480
had to speed around the city keeping its

623
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,660
speed over 50 I think it was called the

624
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:08,090
bus that couldn't slow down captain my

625

don't get no benefit we've been coming

629
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,520
to the same party for 12 years now and

630
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,730
in no way is that depressing

631
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,770
okay I was at a wine tasting with my

632

635
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,380
