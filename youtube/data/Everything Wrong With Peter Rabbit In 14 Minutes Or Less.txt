1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,450
as if the 40 seconds of logos wasn't

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,830
enough all three of them are different

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,139
Sony logos we get it just bring on the

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,790
unnecessary mining of our rabbit based

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:24,939
childhood nostalgia already if there's

6
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,109
one thing I really want from a movie

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,609
it's to kick off with birds singing

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,320
clichÃ© phrases from motivational posters

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,789
yeah sorry about that

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,770
that's not the story where it's having

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,660
hair Asian movie title is somehow a part

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,809
of the physical world of the movie are

13
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:42,760
they the same size is what be consistent

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,469
with this it's their air you don't know

15
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:47,320
any cuts gross angry everyone cuts grass

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,420
angry I intently watch all my neighbors

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,590
do their yard work and none of them

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,239
looks happy when they see me staring at

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,579
them from behind the curtains really

20
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,140
does that all works my life will be

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,850
pleased to hear this I don't know why

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,870
I'm salad it's the dressing get it on

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,430
the side so begins a terribly

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,200
frustrating theme in this movie what the

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,520
animals do and don't know about real

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,910
life chubby bunny would be excellent at

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,510
cinemasins

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,460
Cottontail has great aim and a hell of

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,750
an iron one would almost have to be a

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,190
Jedi with the force and unimpressive

31
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,770
parents to be able to make that shot if

32
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,360
I sigh at the same time as rolling my

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,780
eyes can I call it a sigh roll yes or no

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,410
I can't see through the gate no no no no

35
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,240
I think you said yes Peter apparently

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,560
went to the Brett Ratner school of

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,620
hearing things I'm gonna put you in a

38
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,710
pie like I get your dodge how exactly

39
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,270
does Alan grant McGregor know that he

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,380
killed this random rabbits father

41
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,330
watercolors position animation within

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,730
animation that's like 16 narrations Wow

43
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,440
McGregor just slammed that pole in there

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,030
without even digging the hole first dude

45
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,010
must be jack or small or whatever the

46
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,420
hell kids are saying these days sorry

47
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,890
kids unless one of your parents kicks it

48
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,300
your story will never be good enough to

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,160
chill in an animated film he was hoping

50
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,140
also not to say that old man McGregor is

51
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,300
not a right old tosser but it is his

52
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,130
garden and his vegetables that he bought

53
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,570
with his money at this point I'm not

54
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,890
sure why we aren't team McGregor here

55
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,780
whoa Peter Rabbit just went dark young

56
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,520
Peter not only sees his dad get reek

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,320
slammed he has to watch him be served up

58
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,980
in a pie

59
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,360
Beatrix Potter was like the Lars von

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,870
Trier of

61
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,849
children's authors I promise I'll always

62
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,810
be here for you and she has ever since

63
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,640
their mother died but her death wasn't

64
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,140
as tragic so no need to go into that

65
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,390
story

66
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,129
knew he is God because even though I

67
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,510
can't communicate with you and somehow

68
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,040
knew that the jacket was very important

69
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,090
to you when you would come back to get

70
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,690
it Ruby says few to anyone fortunate

71
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,890
enough to have never heard steal my

72
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,450
sunshine countlessly on the radio in

73
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,340
1999 oh I thought they were never gonna

74
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,750
have to hear it again also these rabbits

75
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,980
realize there's not an unlimited supply

76
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,900
of food right McGregor is not there to

77
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,040
plant the vegetables then they won't

78
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,209
grow any more they understand the

79
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,769
concepts of what subterfuge and salad

80
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,060
dressing is so why the crap don't they

81
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,590
understand gardening thank you for the

82
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,430
party was pickling eating celery it's a

83
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,290
shame when you don't know who you are

84
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,780
but big wing is a pig and so therefore

85
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,340
he's an omnivore which means he will eat

86
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,790
anything

87
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,500
and celery would definitely fall into

88
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,209
this category of anything bad Tommy

89
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,650
you're one of the good ones that's

90
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,599
racist look can't be more inclined to

91
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,250
believe in walking talking rabbits than

92
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,569
I would that you could possibly open a

93
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,640
door this way also for a slob that is so

94
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,290
self negligent that he's headed for an

95
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,430
early death McGregor's house is

96
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,560
amazingly clean so in the time it takes

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,030
them to track down Thomas no one

98
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,530
involved with the estate holdings came

99
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,329
by to check on the house maybe lock the

100
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,099
door and or kick all the animals that

101
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,989
had taken up residence out and while B

102
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,190
seems more than okay with a rabbit

103
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,109
stealing from McGregor's garden I'm not

104
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:33,519
so sure he would just let them destroy

105
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,250
the house also Animal House mr. McGregor

106
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,400
will torment us no Jesus movie we get it

107
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,750
this premature celebration is so

108
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,129
premature that these rabbits should be

109
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,829
NASA employees you're seeing him at his

110
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,199
happiest I think you mean hook seus I

111
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,449
have some bad news Thomas your

112
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,549
great-uncle passed away they contacted

113
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:52,810
his place of work and made his employer

114
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,099
tell him this why wouldn't they just

115
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,750
give him a call or send them a letter or

116
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,400
do anything but this

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,500
manaman congratulations

118
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,879
no one starts a conversation like this

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,260
unless they're reading from a script for

120
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,819
children's film where every little last

121
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,409
detail has to be explained now it's a

122
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:13,310
party

123
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,930
well no one's wearing pants this entire

124
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,760
movie so I guess it's been a party for a

125
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,180
while

126
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,010
Harold and Kumar would be proud also I

127
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,959
get that they're raging and but why are

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,130
they spending so much time in the house

129
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,960
don't wild animals like to be on time

130
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,340
are they abandoning their natural

131
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,630
habitat just so they can throw each

132
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,880
other at a wall I don't know anyone from

133
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,740
Wyndemere it's been unclaimed property

134
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,300
huge remains you've inherited something

135
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,070
if whomever sent this information knows

136
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,570
where Thomas lives why didn't they use

137
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,010
that address to let him know about the

138
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,930
death that's all well maybe Thomas can't

139
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,520
actually hear the goose speaking he'd

140
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,780
definitely be able to hear whatever the

141
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,039
hell noise it's making not to mention

142
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,210
all the animals running around and

143
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,400
making noise you know like we're all

144
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,340
connected but with what rope plays Peter

145
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,199
acting hi our carrots like the marijuana

146
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,639
of the animal kingdom or is he just

147
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,410
hoping to score some Cottontail even

148
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,789
though humans can't understand when the

149
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,110
animals talk all the different species

150
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,699
of animals can easily communicate with

151
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,150
each other

152
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,370
geez movie secret life of pets much just

153
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,440
because you can't see him doesn't mean

154
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,080
he can't see you understand sure makes

155
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,820
sense to me but what doesn't make sense

156
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,979
is how you knew it was a him that was

157
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,270
approaching and the deductive reasoning

158
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,250
of these animals is astounding not only

159
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,199
do they know what a pinky is they

160
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,580
immediately assume that this dude is a

161
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,530
descendant and not like a caretaker or a

162
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,260
real estate agent it wasn't a knight as

163
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,330
OCD as the movie has made Thomas the

164
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,160
wing congenita be he still was somehow

165
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,750
able to sleep in a room as disgusting as

166
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,340
this at least someone's still using a

167
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,199
blackberry also these rabbits have wet

168
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,520
wipes hidden somewhere weird and all

169
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,870
that fruit whose go thank you

170
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,240
those look like expensive ass binoculars

171
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,190
B just met this mother Karen handed over

172
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,010
a pair of $200 Orion's I don't care I'm

173
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,960
going in - Peter have such a boner for

174
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,400
this house anyway I know his father was

175
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,050
killed and all but he got vengeance on

176
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,669
the old man and the vegetable garden

177
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,050
should be already decimated at this

178
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,849
point I realize we are playing fast and

179
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,470
loose with reality here but how did he

180
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,150
teleport there so quickly is his actual

181
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,889
name Nightcrawler MacGregor dr.

182
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,330
Manhattan MacGregor this rabbit shell

183
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,310
game is clever funny and full of the wit

184
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,139
seen throughout the film I mean it ain't

185
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:12,529
patent

186
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:13,849
or anything but it's still worth us in

187
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:20,929
awe for so many smiles yeah I totally

188
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:21,979
can't hear a single word of this

189
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,269
detailed joke conversation we're having

190
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,329
why am I talking to wildlife make up

191
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:27,859
your mind movie are you gonna be a

192
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,239
self-aware a satirical take on a

193
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,559
children's classic or are you going to

194
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,659
intentionally be stupid fine the animals

195
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,579
can talk and do humanistic things but if

196
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,779
they've never left the garden area how

197
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,919
the hell would Peter know enough about

198
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,169
this car to do this so Peter is able to

199
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,939
get the hood back open to free his ear

200
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,769
but somehow the hood is back down in the

201
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,779
very next scene and Peter is acting as

202
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,039
if this is right after his ear was

203
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,449
caught where did he hide when Thomas

204
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,039
closed the hood the second time and or

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,479
how did the hood cause all by itself

206
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,549
yeah we don't inherit the earth we

207
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:55,759
borrow it I read that on a plastic cup

208
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,109
not only does Peter know what a plastic

209
00:06:57,109 --> 00:07:00,709
cup is he can read we emit smoky which

210
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:01,879
is why I think she's just got a thing

211
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,979
for those rabbits which is why I think

212
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,419
she's just got the thing for most man

213
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,549
but no lip reader would mistake rabbits

214
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,499
for man buts it's almost as if the movie

215
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:10,729
wanted to say butts and get a cheap

216
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:19,219
laugh but never of what movie turns

217
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,899
real-world physics on and off depending

218
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,759
on if it suits the joke these hitch

219
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,409
hopping rabbits will spend the next 20

220
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,849
seconds hanging out of this window and

221
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,049
will never be seen despite being

222
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,399
completely invisible in the rear view

223
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,589
mirror I'm allergic to blackberries very

224
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,119
shadowy some people do have legitimate

225
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,889
medical conditions of course of course

226
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,360
it's a real struggle my heart goes out

227
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,799
some it's very tough very sad I'd only

228
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,449
get any letters now we've got a fourth

229
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,949
wall break that references the impending

230
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,869
controversy about food allergies Jesus

231
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:44,449
Christ movie pick a lane Berman what

232
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,249
does Fuhrman mean like a rodent Peter

233
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:50,689
knows what allergies are along with

234
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:51,979
everything else he's talked about in

235
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,379
this film but not vermin or rodents he

236
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,849
sure did get pretty lucky to peel the

237
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,829
exact tiles to create the most on the

238
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,329
nose words pointing to their own

239
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,249
character traits huh peel heel

240
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,169
you can't call peel when you still have

241
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,969
tiles unused what kind of anarchist

242
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,679
loosey-goosey gamma Bananagrams is this

243
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:10,249
rotten banana I say like people who

244
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,079
aren't who they say they are the hotels

245
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,789
boys she doesn't like the one thing he

246
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,259
is and will eventually figure this out

247
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,879
but then it will all come down to a

248
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,319
misunderstanding and there will be a big

249
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,639
change in character and they will fall

250
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,689
in love and live happily ever after

251
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,070
cliche

252
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,590
with Tara did listen to worse actually

253
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,090
it is which the movie will explain

254
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,920
though it's often spelled with two R's

255
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,690
however I'm sitting this because there's

256
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,340
no way these two appealed enough tiles

257
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,870
for either one of them to call bananas

258
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,490
you're supposed to keep peeling until

259
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,750
there aren't enough tiles for everyone

260
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,490
to peel again and only then can someone

261
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,780
call bananas and since they've only

262
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,370
filled four tiles since we saw this many

263
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,870
left in the bag I call banana ground

264
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,850
Finnegan's banana goons shenana grams

265
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,540
Herbal Essence Inge sorry to interrupt

266
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,250
this interspecies WrestleMania with some

267
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,810
facts but if that rabbit took a full

268
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,160
domhnall gleeson it would cease to exist

269
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,410
it would be no more that is an ex rabbit

270
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,400
rabbit Bunch

271
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,710
wait is this from the paintings POV if

272
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,330
not why is the blue paint hovering in

273
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,250
the air and if it is wouldn't all the

274
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,630
other paint be on there too where is

275
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,430
camera it's ruined

276
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,560
you know how unconsolable wildlife can

277
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,570
be she's seriously blaming a rabbit for

278
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,830
this while it's clear that B would be

279
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,390
annoying she has to realize that Thomas

280
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,650
either had something to do with it or

281
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,580
did nothing to stop it

282
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,740
also Thomas's reaction here would imply

283
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,480
that he is literally setting a rabbit up

284
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,830
and assumes that the rabbit also

285
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:26,930
understands that he's being set up

286
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,000
I guess he wishes someone cock-blocked

287
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
him sorry I had to also haven't seen

288
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,810
this many rooster jokes in a movie since

289
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,220
that 15th anniversary sing-along

290
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,840
screening of raqqa doodle antonin last

291
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,230
year

292
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,510
I mean went to in costume I mean why you

293
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,100
kids walking so slow and that is how you

294
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,650
sneak up on someone actually it's not if

295
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,240
you were walking in slow motion there is

296
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,800
a much greater chance that they'll see

297
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,140
you sneaking up on them the rabbits

298
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,820
managed to home alone Thomas but even

299
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,930
Harry and Mara would be able to

300
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,730
anticipate these Purana traps that'll do

301
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,410
two hedgehogs not shoot their quills on

302
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,060
like a porcupine the quills don't even

303
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,800
detach from their body very easily also

304
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,120
mrs. tiggy-winkle survives this

305
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,740
seriously what's the fucking point of

306
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,210
the electric fence if it can't take out

307
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,840
one faceless Hedgehog

308
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,630
this works receding hairline

309
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,620
[Music]

310
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,230
oh sure these bunny geniuses know how to

311
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,030
rewire electricity when they need to but

312
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,350
don't try to run out of this hole as

313
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,880
soon as explosives are dropped in pick

314
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
an animal like you movie I think I've

315
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,230
got some kind of ulterior motive because

316
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,150
of losing my own mother and father and I

317
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,980
think if she goes what have I got this

318
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,690
movie doesn't go for B movie on us and

319
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,130
end with these two on their bunny moon

320
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,870
together but here's a sin anyway for the

321
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,400
sting of dangling us so close to that

322
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,200
one B you can see he's getting pelted in

323
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,580
the nuts with vegetables right we have

324
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,440
the same view she does okay so Peters

325
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,670
clearly been killed based on the

326
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,170
sequence of events not how I would have

327
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,520
been to the kids movie but at least it's

328
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,590
over damn it these people have used

329
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,360
explosives before to keep the rabbits

330
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,630
out explosives how exactly does Thomas

331
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,220
think all of this will work out if he

332
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,930
wants to bang B he probably needs to let

333
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,190
the rabbit thing go how was he going to

334
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,330
explain it if he blew up the tree the

335
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,770
previous night where did these bright

336
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,660
green stains come from when the last of

337
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,830
the berries had been flung they were

338
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,480
nowhere to be seen and what fruit

339
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,040
vegetable would even make such a stain

340
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,900
let's get away from this evil man

341
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,800
since when does this rabbit have a

342
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,430
conscience

343
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,720
he literally thought he murdered this

344
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,610
man twice and has hopped along his merry

345
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,260
way but a little breakup brings along

346
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,390
the rabbit tears this wasn't part of the

347
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,060
plan huh this is was it always has been

348
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,890
exactly the plan how is the garden this

349
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,750
meticulously maintained especially after

350
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:43,560
all the explosions thing I just happened

351
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,790
to be walking by my former place of

352
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,710
employment and home to horrible memories

353
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,570
for no apparent reason that I'm scared

354
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,420
Peeta don't be I'm gonna fix this why

355
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,160
are they so scared in fact the MacGregor

356
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,180
house is back open

357
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,590
why aren't they infiltrating that again

358
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,420
and if not them the rest of the wildlife

359
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,400
that was there last time oh sorry sorry

360
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,290
for these six hundred tenth time in this

361
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,030
movie I've yelled how does nobody see

362
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,240
this obvious rabbit at my screen do such

363
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,580
a thing I have many enemies well there's

364
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,020
no one else out here except these two in

365
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,880
rabbits so was this that heart of a

366
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,320
deduction started I think this entire

367
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,940
movie is from the perspective of a

368
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,360
delusional beat hey rabbit even though

369
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,920
benjamin has never been to the city and

370
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,480
has been shown to be about as smart as a

371
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,130
bag of carrots he knows immediately to

372
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,329
go in robot rabbit

373
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,799
Oh cold wait so now Thomas can hear

374
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,079
Peter talking or is this his heart as

375
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,220
Peter says later they've been talking

376
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,959
around him and B this entire fucking

377
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
movie but only now he can hear him god I

378
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,829
swear this movie is making it up as it

379
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,660
goes along it was dangerous

380
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,389
gutsy convoluted and in a story like

381
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,059
this pretty much a journey guaranteed to

382
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,829
succeed self excusing me rest position

383
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:55,949
what is this a Deadpool movie world

384
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,420
where animals can talk and scheme why

385
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,470
didn't they just tell him what the plan

386
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,850
was instead of slapping his dear rear

387
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,989
he's had this in his jacket the whole

388
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,939
time he ran and jumped on and rode a

389
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,619
train was chased all over the toy store

390
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,119
and had to get back to Wyndemere

391
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,009
but somehow never dropped the one thing

392
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,579
that would keep B from leaving good

393
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,899
thing they still had all this set up and

394
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,519
ready to go and time to shock the new

395
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,259
homeowners how did they organize this

396
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,160
party so quickly

397
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,839
is there a bat signal Peter can throw up

398
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,009
that indicates some crazy shenanigans

399
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,689
are in order nothing says the right

400
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:26,009
director for a kid's film like a

401
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,600
filmography of sexual coming-of-age

402
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,399
films like fired up eza and

403
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,199
friends-with-benefits oh good the movie

404
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,939
is still going apparently the role of

405
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,439
Peter was played by the Energizer Bunny

406
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,959
since it just keeps going and going and

407
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,820
going

408
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,690
a b-rabbit bitch sting like a bee

409
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,800
look at him pure evil like the fruits of

410
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:58,760
the devil the thing is this is their

411
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,650
gift okay they're built to be thrown

412
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,240
like a lawn dart they're top-heavy like

413
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
a lawn dart to their bill for accuracy

414
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,290
my opinion it's just the most beautiful

415
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,870
place on earth did you design Ava's face

416
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,540
based on my pornography profile young

417
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,660
rabbit in a blue coat pan no hands

418
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,180
sometimes your pants will come off but I

419
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,560
was not fortunate enough to see the

420
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,950
pants portion on this strike why are you

421
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,510

422
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:29,210
trap and I'll have to annoy daughter

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,090

425
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,490
unqualified half-wit

426
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,870

427
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,700
