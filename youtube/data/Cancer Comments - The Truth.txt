93
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,850
however I would trade away my moral

94
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,560
beliefs that all races and religions are

95
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,540
equal just to not have cancer

96
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,610

101
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,310
cancer but because of my lung cancer

102
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,440
just in case I do have cancer or karma

103

is a little bit controversial but I

138
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,330
don't mind because it's one of my

139
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,920
favorite looks it's one of the looks

140
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,350
that inspire me to become a rapper I'd

141
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,170
like to call this the BBC this next look

142
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,870
is called the 99 percenters because it's

143
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,880
supposed to represent all the greed of

144
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,550
Wall Street because you cover up 99

145
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,670
percent of your face in black makeup oh

146
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,090
wait - black face I wasn't able to wash

147
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,250
off all the black face so now it kind of

148
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,050
looks like I just came out of a coal

149
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,720
mine thankfully I still got this misaki

150

153
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,840

155
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,500
