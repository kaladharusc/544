1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,330
I know 30 seconds of logos isn't

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,769
terribly long but there are so many of

3
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:13,330
these crisps packed in that I can't help

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,770
it's in it I'm not sure what looks more

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,230
fake the Oasis or this over CGI'd Shack

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,730
stack ma'am I haven't seen product

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,170
placement this obvious in a movie since

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,610
some asshole heavily featured Reese's

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,200
Pieces in some movie I can't remember I

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,520
don't doubt that the Oasis gives you a

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,900
chance to be a pole dancer if you like

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,060
or whatever this is I just doubt many

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,590
people engaging in this activity would

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,390
leave their curtains open I was born in

15
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,489
2027 after giving us a pretty fun

16
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,469
unbroken shot movie serves up a heaping

17
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,180
helping of narration can climb Mount

18
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,390
Everest with Batman yeah but I would

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,220
want to climb Mount Everest as Batman it

20
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,989
wants to climb a mountain with Batman

21
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,399
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

22
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,660
also them I guess for the other choices

23
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,309
of climbing partner are Bugs Bunny Harry

24
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,710
Potter neo Godzilla Richard Kimble in

25
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,600
addition to other WB stars check out

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,090
this place it's a casino the size of a

27
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,590
planet and if there's a section of the

28
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,180
movie set there that involves a brief

29
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,920
incarceration a random meeting with a

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,750
morally ambiguous code breaker and an

31
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,280
animal escape you can expect a fan

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,379
revolt okay so here's a line to go

33
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,759
through some portal but they're in a

34
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,409
virtual world so why is there a line at

35
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,490
all I can see that there are multiple

36
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,900
portals but why aren't there more

37
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,790
stacked and an so that lions are no

38
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,960
longer I think I know this is a

39
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,880
simulation oh but what the but Freddy

40
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,140
Krueger be doing on a planet full of

41
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,850
people blasting giant scorpions and

42
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,530
Freddy's out of his depth on this planet

43
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,240
and he's not even in a dream but Yuri is

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,040
one if Wade is reading the description

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,390
of the artifact why didn't he read it

46
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,619
like it's actually written he really

47
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:31,150
needed to convert the time units for the

48
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,290
sake of exposition all your money um how

49
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,790
is this guy playing the game sitting at

50
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,409
a restaurant everyone we've seen so far

51
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,150
has been standing up running and jumping

52
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,890
around their real space but this dude

53
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,100
can just sit when he plays this would be

54
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,270
an orgy of evidence that this is a

55
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,680
little girl's room except for the fact

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
that I don't think it's an orgy of

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,170
evidence that it's this little girl's

58
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:50,380
room

59
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,700
she putting on a front for her parents

60
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,070
yeah like Donkey Kong jr. plush toys and

61
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,689
a plethora girly but what I really like

62
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,700
to do is pull noobs on Planet doom the

63
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,200
most dangerous place in the Oasis and

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,060
okay look there's Jason another guy who

65
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,290
shouldn't be too tough to kill on this

66
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,369
planet they should have called planet

67
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:04,659
doom Warner Brothers Park

68
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,890
apparently this company allows their

69
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,450
employees to go to the Oasis while on

70
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,829
the clock don't ask me how this dude was

71
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,239
playing at his desk and not causing a

72
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
scene before he died and that's what he

73
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,450
gets for playing as Jason Voorhees if

74
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,489
you want to reach under your seats

75
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,260
you'll find that there's nothing there

76
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,230
dick if you're watching this I'm dead if

77
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,639
you're watching this I'm dead cliche I

78
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,609
create into three hidden keys to three

79
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:27,340
magic games damn holidays character when

80
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,840
from Garth Algar to Geoffrey Rush in

81
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,819
seconds flat no one has even gotten one

82
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,799
key some long-forgotten Gunther cracked

83
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,120
the first clue and found the first

84
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,829
challenge well I spent time telling you

85
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,989
how that guy act the first clue when we

86
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,010
can take you straight to the first

87
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,999
challenge filled with even more

88
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,040
pop-culture references I mean what fun

89
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,209
is it to use your brain to solve puzzles

90
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,650
and be an active participant when

91
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,299
watching a movie zero thought I said

92
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,829
also the first guy I didn't get any

93
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,510
points for finding the first portal well

94
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,459
toughing gaining the only ones still

95
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,290
trying are the Gunter's as in egg

96
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,989
hunters oh and of course the Sixers

97
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,400
that's because you gotta trust the

98
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,439
process and just following the orders at

99
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,959
the head of I oh I this dickweed

100
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,760
named Nolan Sorento this is where the

101
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,439
story has an immediate flaw in my eyes

102
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,120
while I truly believe evil corporations

103
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,349
would be doing something like this the

104
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,909
real antagonist should be the scavenger

105
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,650
hunt itself Wayde versus everybody else

106
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,999
adding an evil villain into this mix

107
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,529
takes away from the funk also at this

108
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,849
point I think Ben Mendelsohn's played a

109
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,529
bad guy in a big-budget movie as many

110
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,790
times as Bruce Greenwoods been the

111
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,260
president I've got a question about this

112
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,999
DeLorean aside from the obvious look at

113
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,620
that it's the DeLorean way it makes an

114
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,209
appearance when you're in the Oasis does

115
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:26,589
every car have the same speed

116
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,239
capabilities are they confined to the

117
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,189
vehicles real-world capabilities if so a

118
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,079
DeLorean can only go from 0 to 60 in

119
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,459
roughly eight seconds and at a top speed

120
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,319
of 110 miles an hour which I imagine

121
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,900
sucks in a race like this the last time

122
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,279
we saw these assholes a few seconds ago

123
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,900
Artemis was way the hell ahead of wait

124
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,089
but now they're neck-and-neck girl I

125
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,409
think it's Artemis so during this

126
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,359
crazy-ass race with killer obstacles I

127
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,799
figured I'd give you more exposition

128
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,150
about her rather than waiting until it's

129
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,889
over watching this race I guess thank

130
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,540
God that nobody other than a select

131
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,069
group of believers still try to do this

132
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,389
can you imagine sticking another

133
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,069
thousand or so people in this thing also

134
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,629
this whole race seems to be against the

135
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,279
spirit of what holiday represents why

136
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,689
would you need to enter this race at

137
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:02,949
scheduled times against tons of

138
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,599
opponents it's a virtual world so why

139
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,859
can't you just do this anytime you want

140
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,419
against the AI and if you manage to win

141
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,829
the race then you open the door for

142
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,150
others to copy you and get past the

143
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,469
first challenge by doing no work

144
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:11,979
whatsoever

145
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,989
if parcels DeLorean has the no roads

146
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,459
option why the hell isn't he flying all

147
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,560
over this hey guys on Last Action Hero

148
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,750
reference for the WIMP this 10 second

149
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,340
t-rex scene is somehow better than both

150
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,730
Jurassic world and its sequel

151
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,580
[Music]

152
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,139
it Kong seriously just peace out after

153
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,550
destroying the road you can see them

154
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,630
right here right what if they found

155
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,160
another way around Wade's car isn't even

156
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,930
damaged sad to say this is the most

157
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,639
successful movie that the Iron Giant has

158
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,990
ever been in favorite restaurant was

159
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,669
Chuckie Cheese I know holiday was a nerd

160
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,620
but no person on this earth would put

161
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,940
Chuckie Cheese down as their favorite

162
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,229
restaurant outside of someone who was

163
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,570
five I stopped because of Kong no one

164
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,130
ever makes it past Kong that's like a

165
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,320
rule if possible knows this then why was

166
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,760
he so confident when he got close to the

167
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,270
finish line

168
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,130
he knew Kong was hot on this trip I need

169
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,100
every edge I can get every push punch

170
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,320
gunshot you feel it all

171
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,789
how does feeling pushes punches and

172
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,680
gunshots give you an edge and from what

173
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,940
we've seen gunshots just kill you

174
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,010
immediately so what good is that Jesus

175
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,930
how many retro bags of Doritos does this

176
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,789
family need one on the fridge one on the

177
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,500
coffee table wait this is the virtual

178
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,630
reality or is it reality reality because

179
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,919
if it's the latter Wade's a superhuman

180
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,419
who can take a direct punch to the face

181
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,160
without any physical damage to him or

182
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,990
his glasses how will you eat up my

183
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,360
valuable such time today isn't providing

184
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,830
information to Gunter's the curators

185
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,479
only job and it's not like there's

186
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,130
anybody else here so why isn't he

187
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,720
ecstatic the parcel is here to use it

188
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,310
some things you're perfect just the way

189
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,310
they are asteroids people don't live

190
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,950
inside an asteroids arcade cabinet the

191
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,450
scene is a perfect example of how easy

192
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,800
it is for British actors to do a

193
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,690
believable American accent and because

194
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,220
that's not fair I'm sending these all

195
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,620
right Micah gates I can't go backwards

196
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,190
for watch backwards really fast fast as

197
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,820
we can

198
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,440
this is the clue it's one of the most

199
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
forward over pieces of video in the

200
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,740
holiday journals and yet nobody figured

201
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,720
it out for five years remember a whole

202
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,070
bunch of assholes have tried that race

203
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,930
over and over knowing King Kong is

204
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,460
impossible to get past and yet nobody

205
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,020
thought this go backwards thing was

206
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,419
important also it's AI Butler guy was

207
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,190
told we're finished but kept playing the

208
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,840
video long after and yeah I know he's

209
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,370
actually simon Pegg's avatar but how

210
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,900
many times has he seen people not get

211
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,099
this clue there's nothing special about

212
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,680
wait lots yet anyway back again so soon

213
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,419
you know considering she's a well known

214
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,770
Gunther it's extremely weird that

215
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,360
parsable is never seen Artemis until the

216
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,860
last race and now she's apparently had

217
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,110
all of them Wow wait isn't nearly this

218
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,009
close to Artemis

219
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,869
oh come on newbie got the DeLorean the

220
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,610
triumphant moment you've even got Alan

221
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,199
and Sylvester doing your school you

222
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,699
can't put in some actual Back to the

223
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,289
Future music I was just wondering what

224
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,939
that does the scoreboard matter if the

225
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,559
goal is to find the keys and solve

226
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,509
holiday scavenger hunt the points hardly

227
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,689
matter we estimate we can sell up to 80

228
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,020
percent of an individual's visual field

229
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,110
before inducing seizures does a company

230
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,879
need with eighty percent advertisements

231
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,379
if they win the contest and own the

232
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,270
Oasis which is worth half a goddamn

233
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,860
trillion dollars and is a money printing

234
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,129
machine

235
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,990
yeah greed and whatnot but you'd lose

236
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,370
probably half the people who go to the

237
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,289
Oasis hope that coca-cola revenue is

238
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,969
enough to make up for it also it's funny

239
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,889
how IO is considered an evil corporation

240
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,899
while Halliday and Mauro or considered

241
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,339
Saints even though everything in the

242
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,080
Oasis cost money and they set up a

243
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,279
system where it's difficult to compete

244
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,279
with richer players whoa smack you did

245
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,749
some Equis pull a Biff and go back in

246
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,129
time to steal the Rubik's Cube for this

247
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,399
design x1 have two possible shopping in

248
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,990
the Oasis so when you buy something that

249
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,029
can only be used in the Oasis like the

250
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,589
Holy Hand Grenade that makes sense but

251
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,180
you can buy something in the Oasis that

252
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,379
you can use in the real world right

253
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,759
there are drug dealers here that you can

254
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,349
pay and fake money and they make actual

255
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,029
deliveries cuz that's the movie I want

256
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,909
to see oh yeah orgasm boxing this

257
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,559
haphazard password storage is going to

258
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,240
be a huge plot point later but why does

259
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,469
he even need the password this

260
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,089
think-think scans his face when he sits

261
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,569
down discount Thanos there's only three

262
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,120
things in this world I hate steampunk

263
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,490
pirates and tabbouleh this character is

264
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,229
as unnecessary in this movie as TJ

265
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,269
Miller is unnecessary as a comedian he

266
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,059
totally totaled his car but then show

267
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,889
got it - how did he total his car the

268
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,419
track that you drive on has absolutely

269
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,559
no obstacles I'm not wearing that

270
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,879
Artemus just made a huge deal about

271
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,379
parsable not being able to walk around

272
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,330
without a disguise but why is she not

273
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,069
wearing one anymore she was the second

274
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,300
player to get the key and she was a

275
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,979
previously famous blogger so why isn't

276
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,439
she getting mobbed - Halliday went on a

277
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,629
date with Ogden tomorrow's wife just

278
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,309
once years before they were even marry

279
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,990
how does she not know this isn't she

280
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,279
just as obsessed with these journals as

281
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,259
he is and she missed this the name Kiera

282
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,120
is only mentioned once in all of

283
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
holidays journals that's not possible

284
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,509
and the curator character is the most

285
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,039
annoying thing about this movie he's a

286
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,029
goddamn machine

287
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,709
he's also Ogden Morrow and his sole

288
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,329
purpose is to search the archives

289
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,619
searching for one word that should take

290
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,689
less than off think second can you drink

291
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,369
things in the Oasis why are there empty

292
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,529
cans of coke and tab in this virtual den

293
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,540
and I see a hint of Pepsi you got two

294
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,980
huge competitors to share time in the

295
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,509
same movie how much did Coke pay to turn

296
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,670
that Pepsi around oh why it's not

297
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,350
changing your identity out in the alesis

298
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,999
a thing anymore like this movie blew its

299
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,980
wad on a Goro alien reference for

300
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,269
Artemus and gave him a Clark Kent

301
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,559
disguise and the motherfucker hasn't

302
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,089
used it's it's I mean even Artemus

303
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,319
didn't remind him to use it again and

304
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,760
this is gonna be a big deal for the plot

305
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,050
[Applause]

306
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,860
[Music]

307
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,910
wait does he have control over

308
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,350
everybody's experience at this dance

309
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,179
club like I'm grooving to fucking Daft

310
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,529
Punk and some asshole can change it to

311
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,540
the Bee Gees seriously no place you can

312
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,009
go in this virtual world that isn't safe

313
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,689
holiday actually built this dance hall

314
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:20,860
and he didn't put any rules about

315
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,389
shooting people here you always got to

316
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,920
be on guard did you know what I said I

317
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,749
set him in love with you tease man the

318
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:26,889
power of boners will make you forget

319
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,059
that you're getting shot at you could

320
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,699
lose all your I guess andis ioi agents

321
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,619
definitely studied Star Wars especially

322
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:35,350
the excellent stormtrooper aim they both

323
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,600
survived this zemeckis cube turns

324
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,339
everything back in time 60 seconds I

325
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,689
guess it's got the same Marty McFly

326
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:42,309
logic to where he didn't give himself

327
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:43,509
enough time to change anything

328
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:44,980
also why doesn't the cube turn back time

329
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,660
for him and Artemis do you really think

330
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,369
that anyone's gonna give a damn about an

331
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:50,439
explosion in some ghetto trash rat

332
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,569
Vaughan in Columbus our villain who I

333
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,189
will reiterate is the worst thing about

334
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:55,749
this story tells wade there's an

335
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:57,369
explosion coming a full minute before it

336
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,230
explodes giving him ample time even if

337
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,610
he were in the trailer Sorrento thinks

338
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,220
he's in to get out before blows don't do

339
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,499
this I'm not even there I'm for long I

340
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:07,029
know he's all horned up for a murdering

341
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,709
but why wouldn't Sorento at least check

342
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,970
to see if Wade's telling the truth here

343
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,709
all he knows is that no one's seen Wade

344
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,029
for three days he doesn't think that's

345
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,649
the least bit suspicious I don't want to

346
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,809
hear your voice ever again oh no way

347
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:17,949
it's terrible and her asshole boyfriend

348
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,869
got blown up I wish I cared but this

349
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,399
explosion leaves me empty vaguely glad

350
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:21,790
it happened

351
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,739
wow this thing blew up in top of the

352
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,209
stacks in a perfect way so that Wade

353
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,439
would have to implement the teachings of

354
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,730
the Prometheus school of running away

355
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,410
from things I oh I came for me in the

356
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,959
real world are you kidding me this

357
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,519
enormous henchman was able to hide

358
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,959
behind this puny desk chair

359
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,939
my real name is Samantha but yeah I'm

360
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,919
Artemis I thought I set up way to be in

361
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,689
love with Artemis and he says I'd love

362
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:42,399
you even if you're hideous but then she

363
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
turned out to be ridiculously hot so he

364
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,879
never has to test that hypothesis I'm

365
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,139
living this close to each other at all

366
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,360
time yeah it's a pretty big enormous

367
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,070
coincidence right like I know

368
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,050
is the new hotness and all but the on to

369
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,730
the two most successful Gunter's living

370
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,080
within a couple miles of each other is

371
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,160
really stretching suspension of

372
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,810
disbelief absolutely that my whole life

373
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,100
you don't have to pretend this just

374
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,080
rings plain false I could understand her

375
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,610
not thinking she's attractive because of

376
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,380
the large birthmark but I do not believe

377
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,820
for one minute that people treat her all

378
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,840
that differently this is like the

379
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,280
mystique conundrum to me only it's

380
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,720
sillier and it's not like there's a ton

381
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,700
of birthmark fetishes out there who skew

382
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,170
the results a place where the leaf

383
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,030
wasn't taken where the date was at the

384
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,040
movies wait when did everybody decide

385
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,450
that they would be teaming up late and

386
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,830
Samantha did all this on their own but

387
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,570
then they just calling all the guys they

388
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,800
think are trustworthy at the drop of a

389
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,030
hat I don't the others do any research

390
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,300
with them the shining eyetality is 11th

391
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,190
favorite horror film Jesus Christ he

392
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,050
ranked his favorite movies by genre past

393
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,530
10

394
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,090
he's clearly wrong by the way and it's

395
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,410
based on the best-selling book by

396
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,450
Stephen King who hated the movie yeah

397
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,520
that doesn't mean he hated his creation

398
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,960
it means he hated Stanley Kubrick's

399
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,220
version of it that's a fudging of the

400
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,590
clue man okay so now my next question is

401
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,390
how hasn't anyone stumbled across this

402
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,160
before and discovered a weird playable

403
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,570
version of The Shining yet I've never

404
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,390
seen The Shining is a really scary me

405
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,100
moving H is a high level Gunther and

406
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,960
parsable said this movie is one of

407
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,940
Halliday's favorites so how the hell has

408
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,340
h not seen it did H just get knocked

409
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,020
around by The Shining Greatest Hits how

410
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,010
is he getting pulled out of the freezer

411
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,540
from the hedge maze what a bunch of bull

412
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,400
Stanley Kubrick will likely come back to

413
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,810
life after this and slap Steven

414
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,130
Spielberg around and then wait another

415
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,020
15 years to make a new movie Howdy's

416
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,760
greatest fear wasn't the shining or any

417
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,890
book or movie his biggest fear was

418
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,640
kissing a girl

419
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,770
that's the leap you couldn't take I like

420
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,000
how this is being shared as new

421
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,440
information when that's exactly why

422
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,760
they're here in the first place remember

423
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,860
this he had a chance with Keira his

424
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,020
chance to kiss her he did take Thalia

425
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,640
so let's stop wasting time already none

426
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,720
of this is in the shining the whole

427
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,250
shining trivia is just a diversion

428
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,140
rendering it utterly meaningless glad we

429
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,460
could take a stroll down memory lane to

430
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,810
watch some famous scenes of The Shining

431
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,280
when all somebody had to do is look in

432
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,810
the ballroom and find Kira dancing I

433
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,710
mean seriously

434
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,180
outside of the figuring out the shining

435
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,500
clue what's hard about completing this

436
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,810
challenge kennedy hands this is what the

437
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,970
task is asking her to dance but they've

438
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,590
been saying that the kiss was what was

439
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,970
important yet this is the first thing

440
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,740
Artemis tries probably because a lesbian

441
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,120
lip-lock would have made a few squares

442
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,710
run out of the theater screaming one of

443
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,660
our wala just saw them enter the media

444
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,660
library she cracked the clue we just

445
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,360
have to win the shining challenge do any

446
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,860
of the good guys want to use the forum

447
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,450
Clark Kent glasses that change their

448
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:04,899
avatar

449
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,910
just fucking once so they can't follow

450
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,220
them around I mean goddamn mr. Sorrento

451
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,160
I really think you need to see this I

452
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,509
think you need to see this cliche now

453
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,519
possible it's called the Jade key yeah

454
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,259
but how are these other Sixers also in

455
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,879
the game now if parsable just now want

456
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,019
it's already been shown that everyone

457
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,459
else in the house is kicked downside the

458
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:22,720
movie theater once someone takes the

459
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,519
lead well ain't got one of those van

460
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,230
thingies I guess we'll stop at the

461
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,850
pursuit here even though we have very

462
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,889
usable guns probably a nearby vehicle

463
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,569
and tell those drones to stop droning

464
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:32,980
while you're not doing anything how did

465
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,540
I oh I find that their challenge so fast

466
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,850
I oh I cracked the first three lines the

467
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,230
clue and the person who isn't driving

468
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,850
answer this question keep your eyes on

469
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,319
the road for Christ's sake

470
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,300
also we never find out how the answer to

471
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,619
the third location is solved it's a

472
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,240
solution without proof forever and ever

473
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,629
an Atari 2600 sir every game ever made

474
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,670
for it thousands of possibilities even

475
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,619
Custer's revenge also why didn't

476
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:54,790
Halliday make it possible for multiple

477
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,920
players with two keys to enter infinite

478
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,629
duplicates of this world to attempt the

479
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,189
challenge why is there a fucking line of

480
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,720
people trying games the way the

481
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,920
challenges are set up really short

482
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,329
changes the possibilities of this world

483
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,649
and it's like they forgot they can

484
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,660
literally do anything and avoid

485
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,370
bottlenecks like this how are there no

486
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,809
Gunter's here already I know the high

487
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,879
five or otherwise engaged but the words

488
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,009
out on ioi finding the third clue and

489
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,720
it's taken a while to get this orb up

490
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,429
and running when is she wait please the

491
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,990
pronoun game which I am sure Halliday

492
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,029
was not a fan of so that sorrento has to

493
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,800
figure out who the hell she is also

494
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,449
these guys have hacked into Sorrento's

495
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,009
rig making him think that he's in the

496
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,809
real world including using avatars that

497
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,459
look exactly like the real selves which

498
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,929
reminds me again how many times these

499
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,790
dicks didn't use disguises when they

500
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,230
went egg hunting Wow I thought the

501
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,999
security was last when Dido and parsable

502
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,769
did their sham break it but there's

503
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,660
literally no security outside Sorrento's

504
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,939
office door doesn't even lock why can't

505
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,499
every single one of these avatars remain

506
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,120
disguise during this operation why does

507
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,499
he even need to pull off the disguise

508
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:49,059
right now other than to tell us Mission

509
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,620
Impossible style that's what he's doing

510
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,509
and tip off sorento later even if you

511
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,129
don't think your loyalty employees can

512
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,720
see this hatch because of the helmets

513
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,009
they wear why would you even install a

514
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,879
hatch that can be open from the inside

515
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,019
don't worry about the case sensitive

516
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,579
nature of man only ponder the

517
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,049
capabilities and the destructive power

518
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,879
of man through the course of time really

519
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,410
this rig has that kind of reflective

520
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,699
surface wouldn't the reflection from

521
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:14,559
here just be the back of the rig how is

522
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,790
it perfectly capturing all of his

523
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,110
captors from here there was a much

524
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,519
cooler way to figure this out by looking

525
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:18,790
at

526
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,050
your eyes but let's just go with the

527
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,560
impossible reflection sure what's that

528
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,660
sounds like a great inscription for our

529
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,710
tombstones

530
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,210
I guess Sorrento would be excellent if

531
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,280
not a little overdramatic at cinemasins

532
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,170
sure samantha has the password but

533
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,730
didn't this rig scan Sorrento's face

534
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,560
earlier I guess it forgot some have lost

535
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
if free souls lost their lives

536
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,610
damned movie title ain't dead - in this

537
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,990
version so what's up with the hard for

538
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,730
shadowing also the books don't matter

539
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,730
and now this a force field around the

540
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,740
third challenge I blame how it it why

541
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,000
the would you make it possible for

542
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,710
someone to use a magical item around the

543
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,090
challenge at all this is a world he

544
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,680
created and easily could have restricted

545
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,750
use of any items that made the unfair

546
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,820
Samantha has one goddamn job here and

547
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,290
then she can leave I'm sure this is a

548
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,940
captivating speech and all but she's got

549
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,500
the spell so get the fuck out of there

550
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,980
already

551
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,300
activate iron giant earlier we saw H on

552
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,890
Planet doom trying to win an artifact

553
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,570
that turned her into a giant robot for

554
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,010
two minutes but why did she even try to

555
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,450
enter that deathmatch when she was

556
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,860
building a fully functional Iron Giant

557
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,600
are you willing to zero out for the

558
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,720
Oasis are you willing to fight god damn

559
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
another young adult adaptation that

560
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,170
creates this awesome world ends up

561
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,610
distracted by revolution ready player

562
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,020
one could have been the tits y'all I

563
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,580
don't have time to explain how this ioi

564
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,800
extracts maximum fun from this movie but

565
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
it just does so is this movie saying any

566
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,790
asshole can strap into one of these

567
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,590
suits and just enter the Oasis without a

568
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,030
password I know these Sixers are

569
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,070
supposedly mindless worker bees but not

570
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,720
even a one two three four five password

571
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,370
well I watch this crazy battle unfold

572
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,900
I'm wondering what the fuck are they

573
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,460
shooting at there is no army coming at

574
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,900
them yet and there's no more shield and

575
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,070
the only thing they can do now is

576
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,390
destroy Halliday's fortress that

577
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,190
contains the third key so what's the

578
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,690
plan these two giant armies clash with

579
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,190
one another battles have actually become

580
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,750
boring over the years a whole buncha who

581
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,300
gives it and who the cares lost in an

582
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,610
Eyes Wide Shut orgy of CGI paint a

583
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,650
Twisted Sister and it's weird they're at

584
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,120
least two Pacific Rim sequels in the

585
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,680
same year I don't even understand how

586
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,580
this is possible

587
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,900
holiday actually allowed in his

588
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,030
simulation for you to stick charges into

589
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,530
the fridge and blow it up if this place

590
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,120
plays like the deathmatch arena it is

591
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,830
then the environment itself shouldn't be

592
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,330
damaged considering how much wear and

593
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,650
tear it would undergo every time a

594
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,390
deathmatch is played here also it's a

595
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,040
little weird that before this blue TJ

596
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,630
Miller's character didn't even phone in

597
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,760
a bomb threat I

598
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,080
could hit the iron Giants head with this

599
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,490
weapon and just kill it right now but

600
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,930
decides to go for the hands so that

601
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,940
eventually gravity will decide this Holy

602
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,960
Hand Grenade how much the bat cost less

603
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,600
and it's gonna cost some hay three he

604
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,230
lost not adventure this guy writes off

605
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,120
the correct game being adventurer even

606
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,560
though the clear rule for the incorrect

607
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,420
game is to be sunk into the ice after

608
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,950
playing less than one minute do play an

609
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,690
adventure Ferb I think it was 9 hours

610
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,550
that's what it felt like anyway so did I

611
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,470
oh I play extra terrestrials a game

612
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,050
created by skill screen back in 1983 or

613
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,880
did they play the infamous eet and this

614
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,380
is Spielberg's way of acknowledging it

615
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,940
and distancing himself from it by

616
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,380
spelling it out and making it plural

617
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,580
it's pretty easy if you know what you're

618
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,270
doing really let me finish it for you

619
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,190
all the other keys were solo projects

620
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,630
we're only one person at a time was

621
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,890
allowed at the challenge but on the last

622
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,390
one where you can see what the other

623
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,250
person's doing Halliday said should be

624
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,750
fine to allow a bunch of people to watch

625
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,160
no one's gonna threaten bodily harm to

626
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,840
the other I'm actually fine he has this

627
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,790
extra life thing but he did practically

628
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,140
nothing to earn it he got it from that

629
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,000
curator Graner in the movie all because

630
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,470
he made a bet that Kyra was only

631
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,180
mentioned once in the entire archive I

632
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,740
bet the book did something different

633
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,540
that was a lot more satisfying but the

634
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,340
books don't matter so onward and upward

635
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,380
a massive troll job from Halliday here

636
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,790
you actually have to reach out and grab

637
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,200
the key or else it doesn't count your

638
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,240
avatars can vacuum up unlimited coins

639
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,370
but a key is too goddamn hard meanwhile

640
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,200
doesn't this climactic scene feel an

641
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,970
awful lot like Inception this is the

642
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,380
moment that Halliday made morale sign

643
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,540
over his shares and gregarious sure this

644
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,430
is another test but what happened if

645
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,720
parsable failed is he out of the game

646
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,220
does he still have all three keys what

647
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,030
do you have to go through the whole

648
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,830
process again even though he knows how

649
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,060
to beat the levels I'm just saying this

650
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,710
is a totally unnecessary plot twist that

651
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,120
doesn't have any bearing on the quest

652
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,270
itself this is the button if you push it

653
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,580
the whole simulation shuts down that's

654
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,080
why it's easily accessible and can be

655
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,760
pushed on accident seriously this

656
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,260
asshole holiday can't find the egg

657
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,910
meanwhile Sorrento is getting closer to

658
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,470
knocking Wade out of the Oasis while

659
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,120
dickhead here looks for it seriously if

660
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,530
something happens to wade here isn't

661
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,480
gregarious games and breach of contract

662
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,710
if they don't give the company to him

663
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,240
after doing everything required by the

664
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,760
game to win you're not an avatar are you

665
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,760
know it's holiday really dead yes then

666
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,920
what are you the vibe person something

667
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,420
that would be way unsatisfying to here

668
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,190
explain so we'll keep it on explained we

669
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,360
brought up a mystery you didn't even

670
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,640
need Wade Ogden

671
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,260
yeah I'm pretty surprised too this

672
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,970
mother hasn't been in hardly any of this

673
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,410
movie so this is a slightly different

674
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,210
contract from the one Wade refused to

675
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,530
sign just a minute ago when he learned

676
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,760
he was being tested but it's still a

677
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,230
contract where the buyer buys the

678
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,390
company for a billion dollars it has

679
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,620
nothing to do with giving the company

680
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,240
over for winning the contest he's a

681
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,309
curator movie reveals Simon Pegg was the

682
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:01,530
curator all but does that mean he was in

683
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,150
the simulation every day attending to

684
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,200
every single person who ever walked

685
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,370
through there for every waking minute

686
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,170
hope that was by appointment only the

687
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,090
third thing we did wasn't as popular we

688
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,070
closed the Oasis on Tuesdays and

689
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,140
Thursdays meaning people who only used

690
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,669
it Tuesdays and Thursdays because those

691
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,020
were their only days off from work we're

692
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,370
fucked why not just put a limit on the

693
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,750
amount of days in a week rather than

694
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,760
cutting out specific days and don't they

695
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:32,669
go to school using the Oasis oh my god

696
