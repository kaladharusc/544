00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,880
I want to emphasize a point maybe I'll

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,769
maybe I'll remove them just so you guys

13
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,849
know that I'm serious

14
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,250

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,770
the road

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,760
a freak of nature

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,710
that it's good thing they invented

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,629
something to prevent you from getting

27
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,010
fur balls from licking your cat

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,229
introducing licky brush cats we need to

29
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,020
learn as a form of social bonding as a

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,360
human you're left out of this intimate

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,080
Richard oh how disappointing to be left

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,900
out of an animal's ritual its it's too

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,060
bad that I'm left out of the dog

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,270
sniffing other dogs assholes ritual man

35
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,860
and that one's so essential too cuz

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,500
that's a greeting it's a shame I'm left

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,600
out of the bonobos fucking each other

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,880
ritual because that's I mean athing

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,170
normal ritual I really like to be

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,070
involved in that somehow

41
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,840
[Music]

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,060
I'm looking for a word to describe that

43
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,750
and no words are coming to mind gay is

44
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,840
one that's good right one of my line is

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,880
tech tips yeah I'm sure the cat really

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,890
understands that that's your tongue and

47
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,840
it's really like turned on by that fact

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,090
I'm sure the cat was yearning to be

49
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,800
fucking licked it wasn't part of the

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,540
family before but now that you got a

51
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,970
silicon cat tongue I finally found my

52
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,920
forever home it's in this house where

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,500
all these grown-ass people are passing

54
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,080
around a nun glorified pacifier and

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
taking turns licking me

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:24,190
I feel like this starting to get into

57
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,780
the whole like Planet of the Apes or a

58
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,570
role reversal type situation or we're so

59
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,090
cut that we're willing to actually give

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,250
shit up for the camp like we've always

61
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,190
been this oppressive overlord for the

62
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,590
cats I think I should strip off all my

63
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,450
clothes and hop in the cat's cage just

64
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,010
so the cat feels like it has a little

65
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,440
bit more power let's say it's a century

66
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,840
ago in 1916 and you have this wonderful

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,610
invention that you're introducing to the

68
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,950
market called the leaky brush you'd be

69
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,630
lucky if they didn't just string you up

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,459
in a tree because you're absolutely

71
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,280
insane and that they don't want precious

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
materials being wasted on such an insane

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,720
idea oh you have a relationship problem

74
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,190
with your cat well here's a shotgun

75
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,890
sorta down relationship problem with

76
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,950
your cat huh well it's a cat you ever

77
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,730
think about that

78
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,520
what cat tip if you want to connect more

79
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,040
with your feline friend doing cat-like

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,020
things doesn't make them like you

81
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,360
anymore hacking up a furball licking

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,190
them with your bare tongue it won't make

83
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,970
a difference

84
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,610
grooming is more fun with licky try

85
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,100
grooming your dog rabbit and other pets

86
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,920
yeah other pets what do you mean like a

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,209
boa constrictor

88
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,700
maybe groom a salamander or a skink

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,860
emphasis on the grooming part because

90
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,620
when you when you walk into a Petco in

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,390
the grooming department all the

92
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,700
associates look like this develop a

93
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,739
deeper relationship with your cat you

94
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,390
want to have sex with your cat because

95
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,650
if you want it or if you really want to

96
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,060
have sex with your cat this will

97
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,200
actually friendzone

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,090
you with your can be part of the change

99
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,340
let's change the way people connect with

100
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,739
their feline housemates so I think this

101
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,629
is very stupid because they're falling

102
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,700
into the trap that change is innately a

103
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,190
good word oh yeah very positive change

104
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,650
would you guys in the audience agree the

105
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,670
change is good

106
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,590
yo you answered yes to it well you're

107
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,019

108
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,019
their cats over for licky parties yeah

109
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,729
that's exactly what I want to do with my

110
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,070
time I want to invite my friends and

111
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,040
their cats over so I can lick some pussy

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,280
Oh a tail toppers for cat depression I

113
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,590
noticed that leaving my cat alone for

114
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,690
over 12 hours a day had a toll on the

115
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,790
overall quality of life for my kitty cat

116
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,120
he wasn't as frisky as he used to be he

117
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
was depressed okay well if you're away

118
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,430
for 12 hours a day maybe a cat isn't for

119
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,190
you maybe a goldfish is more your speed

120
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,320
that's when I notice that scratching my

121
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,840
Kathy on the bass of its tail with relax

122
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,850
and make him so happy and that's how the

123
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,550
tale topper was invented 3d printed

124
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,560
googly eyes and a moustache to clip on

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,870
your cat's asshole that ought to do the

126
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,270
trick it's just like rubbing the base of

127
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,120
your cat's tail go find someone ask them

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,550
to give you a massage on your shoulders

129
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,340
and then ask them to attach some chip

130
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,160
clips to your shoulder blades and see if

131
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,930

132
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,900

133
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,000
bring awareness to the issue of pet

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,850
depression please consider backing this

135
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,650
is how you know when someone has

136
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,770
completely abandoned any semblance of a

137
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,330
good product it's to raise awareness

138
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,300
especially when they say it's a token we

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,639
all know what he means there is it's

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,410
fucking garbage it's raising awareness

141
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,950
garbage Rudy's small dog or cat pet

142
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,449
carry hoodies just

143
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,150
bouncing balls retrieving sticks and

144
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,900
sniffing butts this is way better than

145
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,340
any of those I so need a Rudy in my life

146
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,280
goodness said it better myself yep BAM

147
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,289
yeah bouncing balls and sniffing butts

148
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,009
yeah

149
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,770
Owen nothing better than a Rudy if Rudy

150
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,050
actually meant attaching a dog to your

151
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,440
body for hours on end no no I can't say

152
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,780
that I agree as you can see Jackson

153
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,520
absolutely loves hanging out in his

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,350
routine no I could tell just like the

155
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,630
cats from earlier I can tell with very

156
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,910
expressive face that he enjoys this shit

157
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,100
out of that fucking Rudy no I mean he's

158
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,930
not struggling so clearly he enjoys it

159
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,789
right I've ventured a guess if you just

160
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,740
put on the Rudy he'd come over and

161
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,780
actually insert himself in the pocket of

162
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,240
it like a kangaroo baby the inspiration

163
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,490
for Rudy came from growing up on a firm

164
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,440
I can remember the days when we used to

165
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
put kittens in the pockets of our

166
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,830
hoodies and just how much they loved it

167
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,020
yeah I'm a farm guy myself as well I

168
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,099
grew up on a farm we had tortoises and

169
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,130
we had a we had a couple lemurs real

170
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,440
good farm animals much like cats yeah

171
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,180
yeah no yeah I have a lot of cats on the

172
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,699
farm they produce a lot of milk all we

173
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,800
needed was a bigger pocket right so

174
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,870
that's what we did I'm okay with this if

175
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,760
your dog is crippled you know you you

176
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,199
really want to be close to your dog you

177
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
love it I understand it maybe other

178
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,919
people would put the dog down at that

179
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,110
point but if you really love your dog or

180
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,210
your cat yeah and is its legs or just

181
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,400
twisted and mangled mess

182
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,199
maybe you shove it in the pocket and you

183
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,240
give it a walk around the town however

184
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,940
if it's just so that you can be cute

185
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,610
with your dog and have the dog be cute

186
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,840
with you then take a bullet once your

187
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,580
pet gets a taste of just how comfortable

188
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,669
and cozy not to mention how lazy they

189
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,909
can be oh no no no let me I gotta stop

190
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,190
it there right because you said how lazy

191
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,860
they can be maybe this is just me I'm

192
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,300
gonna need your guys's feedback on this

193
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,710
one because I have no fucking idea

194
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,940
every dog I have met ever has been very

195
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,880
willing and ready to go out on a walk

196
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,440
and it at fucking moment's notice

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
they're never like oh oh do we have to

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,610
do this shit

199
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,759
again no I don't want to go out just

200
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,000
leave me here to die yet no it's better

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,900
this way

202
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,240
Rudy can support pets that are under 15

203
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,729
pounds like Jackson here perfect for

204
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,620
your fur baby no the dog that's in your

205
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,229
pocket is not a fur baby you just have

206
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:14,830
dried up

207
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,990
ovaries okay so there's this group of

208
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,060
people out there who really love their

209
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,180
small little Yorkshire's net so little

210
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,849
things that are fluffy white big beady

211
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,389
eyes be it a pug be it this or that you

212
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,580
know the smaller the limbs the less

213
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,829
mobile it is the better you know if it's

214
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,479
a pug it's just a nice little thing that

215
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,950
you can fucking shake and do whatever

216
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,560
you want with and those people some of

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,890
those people like to treat it as their

218
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,290
baby they'll call it their fur baby and

219
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,480
really they don't do the dog any favors

220
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,519
because they make the dog super

221
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,190
dependent on them and oftentimes it's

222
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,839
just fuck it's just fucking gross to

223
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,579
witness right we've all seen the lady

224
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,860
right walking her dog but not really

225
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,010
walking her dog stroller ring her dog

226
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,230
you know I get it there's a lot of pugs

227
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,860
with fucking blown out eyes and in legs

228
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,190
that are practically vestigial but if

229
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,779
they aren't vestigial and you can

230
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,149
actually walk your Pug please walk it

231
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,490
don't put it in a fucking stroller and

232
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,560
stroller it around you want to know what

233
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,720
I think really causes all the pet

234
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,540
depression out there I don't think that

235
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,449
it's not licking your cat with with a

236
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:28,899
real cat tongue I don't think it's not

237
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,089
having a little toy to attach to your

238
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:33,519
cat's asshole and I don't think that

239
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,620
it's stuffing your animal into a

240
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,380
rucksack I think what really causes

241
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,690
depression is not interacting with your

242
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,120
pets or walking them on a normal basis

243
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
and treating them like the companions

244
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,830
that they are

245
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:58,120
[Music]

246
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:08,020
[Music]

247
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,040
[Music]

248
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,080
all right let's hang up on just like now

249
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,950

250
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,000
