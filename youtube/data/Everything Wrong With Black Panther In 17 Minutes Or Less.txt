1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,290
millions of years ago a meteorite made

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,880
of vibranium exposition about a

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,770
meteorite meteors position exposition

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,929
right also the generation a meteorite

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,509
made of vibranium struck the continent

6
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:21,849
of Africa affecting the plant life

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:23,980
around it yeah but just the plant life

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,570
of Africa I mean wouldn't a meteorite

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,789
big enough to affect an entire continent

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,109
trained a lot of things over the world

11
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:32,410
until a warrior shaman received a vision

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,780
from the pen that God is best ooh with

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,600
what now led him to the heart shaped up

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,120
a plant that granted him superhuman

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,750
strength speed and instincts this planet

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,880
is basically Jesus Jesus the warrior

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,060
became King and the first Black Panther

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,400
roll kitties to keep the brainian safe

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,410
the wakandans vowed to hide in plain

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,250
sight

21
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,540
you know what Condor has the same

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,040
problem as Wonder Woman's the mascara

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,450
you tell him either before Klaw did his

24
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,130
heist not one asshole stumbled upon

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,050
Wakanda by accident in all those years

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,370
yeah it's surrounded by mountains and

27
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,960
what looks like a rain forest but there

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,310
are still flying things like airplanes

29
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,310
right seas to Grace Jones looking chicks

30
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,140
funny joke but Surrey is soon revealed

31
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,759
as being in on the whole undercover

32
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,560
operation so why would he continue the

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,100
subterfuge

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,719
even after in Joe who knows he's caught

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,329
this man ulysses klaw who looks

36
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,619
remarkably the same here is he willing

37
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,049
26 years did you think that you were the

38
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,960
only spy we sent here to Oakland yeah

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,649
totally

40
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,689
to the United States no I'm not that

41
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,490
stupid point is you have been too vague

42
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,719
in your question for my answer to matter

43
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,789
at all yes it's only 33 seconds of logos

44
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,530
but it's all just one logo and that's

45
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,990
excessive the tiny nation of Wakanda is

46
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,030
mourning the death of its mana I know we

47
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,229
need the exposition for the people that

48
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,939
didn't see Captain America Civil War but

49
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,380
T'Challa is seriously using his

50
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,749
incredible technology to watch BBC news

51
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,759
this opening action sequence is just way

52
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,649
too dark I can't even call the movie out

53
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:52,060
for bad staging or choppy editing

54
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,380
because I literally can't see anything

55
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,569
to ruin my mission I will be crowned

56
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,090
King tomorrow I wish for you to be there

57
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,770
wait Nakia was on an undercover mission

58
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,029
to take down a group of human

59
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:02,979
traffickers and to charla it all up just

60
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:03,850
so she could come to the crowning

61
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,770
ceremony I know it's important it but

62
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,389
more important than busting a group of

63
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:09,429
King human traffickers are yourselves

64
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:09,940
home

65
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,830
I'd take deploy what I really she

66
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,330
herself has to get back to Wakanda for

67
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,710
the crowning tomorrow but our heroes are

68
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,420
literally turning to all these just now

69
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,340
release prisoners and saying KanCare

70
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,720
yourselves oh there's no further

71
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,190
assistance you or Wakanda can provide

72
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,930
believe it or not this glory shot at a

73
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,430
landscape with herds of animals running

74
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,230
near a body of water is the least over

75
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,670
lion king rip-off this movie has to

76
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,060
offer

77
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,740
I'm not saying something mighta deceased

78
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,590
that came to see me off before the

79
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,150
siblings immediately identify each other

80
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,710
as siblings anywhere else other than the

81
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,200
movies just something works doesn't mean

82
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,330
that it cannot be improved my dick in a

83
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,070
nutshell dude I don't care if it's his

84
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,690
precociously brilliant sister or not

85
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,460
Cherie just flipped off the current

86
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,080
Prince and future king of this country

87
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,730
in front of all these people with no

88
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,500
repercussions and in case you confused

89
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,640
it for London Nebraska

90
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,530
I mean seriously does anyone meet the UK

91
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,880
part of this title card this is the most

92
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,470
London in London shot ever to London

93
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,240
where is this one far present-day Ghana

94
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,700
well what about this one this eventual

95
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,140
reveal is predicated on the fact that

96
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,000
this museum refuses to use any

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,410
descriptive cards for their priceless

98
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,770
artifacts so how do they need the guise

99
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,510
of the paramedics there's no way the

100
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,400
room cleared that fast oh cool I guess

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,320
claws claw comes with a weapon polishing

102
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,760
setting okay so the water is being

103
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,200
drained ahead of the falls and all these

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,910
people are arriving by boat above the

105
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,830
falls so is there a staircase in these

106
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,660
rock faces do they all rappel down will

107
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,220
be definitely yada-yada is how everyone

108
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,050
actually gets to the very specific and

109
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,250
temporary location for the crowning

110
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,170
slash fight the CG on these Swain people

111
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,760
is so bad the maker of weebles has

112
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,110
suited in civil court for copyright

113
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,070
infringement I'm super confused about

114
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,050
one thing how the throne of Wakanda and

115
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,610
the title of Black Panther are seemingly

116
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,440
linked and yet definitely not linked

117
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,910
because he's been black panther for a

118
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,010
bit even before his dad died and now he

119
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,540
has to have his panther purple drank

120
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,400
powers medically removed in order to

121
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,870
fight for the honour of being King upon

122
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,280
which they will reap herbal drank his

123
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,050
ass and get his super powers back but he

124
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,519
wasn't King before now and still had

125
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,230
powers and was out there fighting he was

126
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,050
black panther estado in civil war did

127
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,730
his dad decide to stay King but give up

128
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,870
the panther juice to his son

129
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,489
goddammit I've written seven lines in a

130
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,780
Word document about this and I'm still

131
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,459
angry about it but also now questioning

132
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,690
my sanity and whether or not I'm the

133
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,760
only one asking these questions

134
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,970
oh no one notice that the jabari tribe

135
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,200
was missing from this entire ceremony

136
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,970
before now I mean it makes for a

137
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,470
dramatic entrance but there definitely a

138
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,940
part of Wakanda and this is a pretty

139
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,470
important de marmol look you should make

140
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,510
a spin-off horror series about mbaku and

141
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,919
the clay masks I don't know if it's the

142
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,330
double eyes or the double mouth or the

143
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,979
west-world worthy map carved into his

144
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:28,820
forehead but this is the most

145
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,930
frightening movie character I've seen in

146
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,930
years

147
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,850
scoffs I tried this on okay a few things

148
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,169
technological advancements should be

149
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,460
overseen by whoever makes them go

150
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,960
smoothly and rapidly what she is doing

151
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,360
second she's 17 going on 18 and almost

152
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,979
no decent english-speaking person would

153
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,990
call her a child 30 you've been up in

154
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,190
the mountains dude you don't get to come

155
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,080
down after I'm guessing decades and

156
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,850
start demanding you chose to leave and

157
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,680
live in seclusion forth and maybe most

158
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,150
simple don't all teenagers scoff a

159
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,690
tradition who could not keep his own

160
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,419
father safe low blow especially since he

161
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:03,710
and his father were way outside the

162
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,240
borders of Wakanda where they can't

163
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,280
possibly control all variables that got

164
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,780
bombed and dude is making it seem like

165
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,100
the chocolate just refused to do the

166
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,419
Heimlich maneuver on his choking father

167
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,210
lowered it to a hanuman wait who hanuman

168
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,560
feels like a sudden new name we are

169
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,849
giving glory prayers to baku had some

170
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:21,470
great trash talk before the fight but

171
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,610
what the hell does this have to do with

172
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,330
anything

173
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,470
character is close to death but is able

174
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,910
to come back because of an inspirational

175
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,289
shout from the audience cliche what the

176
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,729
hell is to charles plan here if when

177
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,620
baku doesn't yield his ass is definitely

178
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,970
going over the falls too even though he

179
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,650
was just gored with a super heavy spear

180
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,270
two challahs chest wound isn't bleeding

181
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,830
at all because we don't want to obscure

182
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,669
those beautiful abs right and so begins

183
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,229
the most annoying request of chadwick

184
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:49,820
boseman career just officially elected

185
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,199
king to chow last two owned agro the

186
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,760
purple heart flower ceremony in order to

187
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,260
receive the black panther powers that he

188
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,550
had prior to this but apparently had to

189
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,050
give up after his dad died until he was

190
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,940
officially elected king or some point is

191
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,620
the half assed this from the get-go damn

192
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,139
this is a MCU movie right so why are the

193
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,610
effects often still lacking they

194
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,960
couldn't afford those wet assholes that

195
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,460
did the jungle book I know to Chama has

196
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,630
security with him and everything but

197
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,070
nobody even looks at the king of Wakanda

198
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,960
as he walks down a busy street let alone

199
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,669
ask for a selfie brought it to Boston

200
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,940
still gray Rhino shadowing my king my

201
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,470
love damn smokey has a lot of

202
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,240
expositional greetings and this movie

203
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,460
does enjoy spending lots of its time gee

204
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,439
whizzing it itself and what are these

205
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:31,580
question is the entire suit sits within

206
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,529
the teeth of the necklace man I love

207
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,029
this Q style tech introduction of the

208
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,649
gadgets as much as anyone but the use of

209
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,719
vibranium totally bypasses explanation

210
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,399
of how all this was developed like it's

211
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,869
basically this is the greatest tech ever

212
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:42,409
invented

213
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,629
yeah but vibranium forever in my nights

214
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:47,269
absorbed the kinetic energy and hold it

215
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,519
in place for redistribution but really

216
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,779
only in this movie you'll see it an

217
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,759
infinity warm but only in the wide shots

218
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,499
for some reason yes we pick back and

219
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:55,610
forth you probably could have saved a

220
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,139
lot of money by bypassing Lupita Nyong'o

221
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,059
in favor of Willow Smith for this role

222
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,489
I saw a Medicus I know Nokia's a badass

223
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,319
spy and all that but how they can she

224
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,879
tell that all three are Americans just

225
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,989
by looking at them from across the

226
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:08,479
casino what I'm doing or not doing on

227
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,249
behalf of the US government is none of

228
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:10,759
your concern

229
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,469
I like martin freeman a lot I even have

230
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,449
a John Watson and a Bilbo Baggins poster

231
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:15,769
up in my bedroom but could they really

232
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,360
not get an actual American actor to play

233
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,709
the Warren American that's prominently

234
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,209
featured in this movie didn't I keep it

235
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,469
under wraps that the king of a

236
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:24,199
third-world country runs around and cats

237
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,699
him despite speaking in somewhat hushed

238
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,559
tones this super sensitive conversation

239
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,599
is easily haribol by anyone nearby the

240
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,879
king of Wakanda is here Ross is a

241
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,589
seasoned veteran of the CIA but he

242
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,209
seriously still stalks into his sleeve

243
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,769
when communicating with his team in case

244
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,089
we didn't have enough clues about what

245
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,829
an evil prick claw is he doubles down on

246
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,959
the parade of villainous black SUVs true

247
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,369
you got a mixtape coming out actually

248
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:45,319
there is one I'll send you the

249
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,909
soundcloud link if you lock don't forget

250
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,559
to catch me on my Institute and check

251
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,079
out my Etsy yes hey how the hell does

252
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,519
useless henchman number four know who a

253
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,319
Koya is even if they're getting set up

254
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,849
it's not like they'd know exactly who be

255
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,309
with T'Challa qualifiers three rounds

256
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,869
directly into the bulletproof suitcase

257
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:01,579
instead of aiming literally anywhere

258
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,709
else this casino fight is rad punctuated

259
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,239
by this glorious one shot up and back

260
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,909
down then back up again panning action

261
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:11,869
Bravo movie man good thing Kalam was out

262
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,249
of bullets there look T'Challa would

263
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:14,449
have totally wasted that bulletproof

264
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,199
suit he's not currently wearing wait

265
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,179
boss sick just right yeah but that's

266
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,829
very important information and it takes

267
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:24,800
much less time to just say right guys I

268
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,479
know it's a preposterous superhero movie

269
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,080
but seriously this works

270
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,669
the hell is this dudes plant sure the

271
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,140
bullets can't penetrate the car but they

272
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,729
can totally penetrate the obvious of

273
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:36,960
Khoya on top of the car

274
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,219
Wow I must have missed the part where

275
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,570
this Black Panther movie officially

276
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,159
turned into a Bugs Bunny cartoon no mall

277
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,720
the songs to have crossing while in

278
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,520
custody so that we know he's crazy you

279
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,260
guys went with this one Shepherds

280
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,500
textiles cool outfits it's just a

281
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,430
chocolate really need the secret

282
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,140
communications device I mean I have a

283
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,070
long way mirror in this interrogation

284
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,870
room so I wouldn't they also be able to

285
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,810
hear what they're saying how is this

286
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,270
take their weapons claw helpfully expose

287
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,830
it's this information to Ross even

288
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,330
though he has no incentive to do so

289
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,950
except for getting more screen time hey

290
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,240
I really can't blame Andy Serkis we're

291
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,500
milking it there at least he gets to

292
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,330
show his actual face for once despite

293
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,950
his injuries and taking off the mask to

294
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,960
chawla impressively pulls off a flawless

295
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,570
zoom and enhance cliche even though they

296
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,010
just relentlessly pursued cloth

297
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,110
throughout the entire city of Busan I

298
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,550
guess let just let him go here along

299
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,960
with the people that own whatever weapon

300
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,210
kick to traumas a second ago Nucky but

301
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,980
it's Ross that's dying why the hell

302
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,350
would appoint a say this I give me a

303
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,959
Kimura beat this is Stabler that seemed

304
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,250
fun now yeah I'll just stick my who's

305
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,540
what into his whatchamacallit and

306
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,279
something-something vibranium give you

307
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,370
into us we can save him and so the CIA

308
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,560
people just said okay and let him be

309
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,000
taken back for healing to what they

310
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,410
truly believe is a third world country

311
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,230
this man is a foreign intelligence

312
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,270
operative how do we justify bringing him

313
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,070
into our body this is an excellent point

314
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,570
I haven't let anyone into a condo for

315
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,490
centuries but they have to get Ross back

316
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,839
there or he'll die it's not like they're

317
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,520
inviting some random asshole won't tell

318
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,850
anyone

319
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,130
motherfuckers in the CIA 30 years you'll

320
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,380
find out who is in power and did nothing

321
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,180
if you ask for to be different but the

322
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,500
channels only been King for like two

323
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,180
days and you spent most of that time

324
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,120
chasing claw give him a break man he's

325
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,390
playing on me

326
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,700
I know yo boos done some questionable

327
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,410
but why did you chock I have to kill him

328
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,800
dead

329
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,090
he's already disarmed him right this

330
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,410
entire movie could have been eighty

331
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,120
percent less conflict that Takako just

332
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,860
uses like Golconda neck pinch or

333
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,600
something man clown looks pretty good

334
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,950
for a corpse that's been flown from

335
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,390
South Korea all the way to akanda in a

336
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,190
tiny unrefrigerated prop plane and then

337
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,390
dragged across the Prairie in the middle

338
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,960
of a hot day

339
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,150
don't touch anything my brother will

340
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,280
return soon Wow ever Ross maybe the

341
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,780
first movie character in history told

342
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,040
not to touch anything that actually

343
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,270
doesn't touch anything

344
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,530
there's vibranium on those trains

345
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,440
vibranium all around us I understand the

346
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,910
conflict about wanting to heal Ronson

347
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,170
Wakanda after he technically saved

348
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,450
Matias life but once he was okay they

349
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,680
could totally move him somewhere else

350
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,540
other than the technological hub of the

351
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,400
entire country you can't let your

352
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,350
father's mistakes define who you are

353
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,450
thing my kids will be chanting it

354
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,890
themselves into the mirror their entire

355
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,770
lives but also he can and he should and

356
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,630
he does because he lets his father's

357
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,190
mistakes eventually help define T'Challa

358
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,230
himself as a better King more open to

359
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,790
the world and giving eight his father's

360
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,590
mistakes directly led to who he becomes

361
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,060
and how he defines himself oh nine

362
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,950
reason I don't kill you I of Stannis

363
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,930
because I know who you are is that

364
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,580
really the only reason like why is Erik

365
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,840
even really in trouble he's got a

366
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,060
wakandan tattoo so he's not trespassing

367
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,620
sure he's a little disrespectful but

368
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,120
that's hardly worthy of a death sentence

369
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,800
I found my daddy will pay at the claws

370
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,840
in his chest record scratch the fuck

371
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,520
wouldn't to chacas claws have been part

372
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,140
of his suit and retracted back after the

373
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,270
stabbing why do you check the claws and

374
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,800
leave them in the dead body he literally

375
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,300
said to the other guy tell no one of

376
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,770
this and then I guess followed that up

377
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,270
with but I'm gonna leave these claws

378
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,790
here like a riddle or some yeah I'm

379
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,650
exercising my blood right the challenge

380
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,570
for the metals of King and black panther

381
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,670
okay but can I really do this it was a

382
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,960
whole thing earlier about the challenge

383
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,340
being on a specific day when the other

384
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,630
tribes declined to challenge before

385
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,230
mbaku

386
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,610
can any one of those warriors walk in

387
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,110
and challenge at any time I know we in

388
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,490
the u.s. probably shouldn't be judging

389
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,960
any other country's politics but that

390
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,490
seems like an inefficient system also

391
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,230
let's talk about kill mongers way

392
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,120
unnecessarily complicated plan he stole

393
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,650
the vibranium from the Museum in London

394
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,550
just so he could get to Charlie's

395
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,140
interest in capturing Klaw in Busan but

396
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,060
if claws group killed two chawla Eric

397
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,020
wouldn't have had the chance to

398
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,190
challenge him for the throne and why

399
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,390
does he need all this to happen anyway

400
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,740
if all he's trying to do is get Chris

401
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,600
from get out support in Wakanda he could

402
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,830
have just killed claw ages ago

403
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,330
considering he already knows where Conda

404
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,670
is and all this death just so I could

405
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,560
kill you man and I thought my family

406
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
get-togethers were awkward last year's

407
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,710
Thanksgiving got nothing on this

408
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,570
kill manga is at once one of our best

409
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,460
comic book movie villains ever and one

410
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,110
of our stupidest this is just so much

411
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,120
dumb it kind of hurts the brain also I

412
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,410
don't know if there's a way to do this

413
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,970
where it's not obvious but who they

414
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,680
believe for a second that T'Challa is

415
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,090
dead here there's 40 minutes of runtime

416
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,690
left

417
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,040
he's the titular character and there's

418
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,020
magic doohickeys all over the place here

419
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,500
of course he survives this Erik beat

420
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,150
T'Challa and everything but he also just

421
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,650
randomly murdered Ghost Dog during the

422
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,000
fight it was a pretty important figure

423
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,530
in Wakanda doesn't that get him in any

424
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,770
trouble I'm loyal to throne know about

425
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,540
the who sits upon it might be time to

426
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,790
reassess the priorities no burn at all

427
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,730
so thankfully she I guess suspected kill

428
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,590
monger might go all burn the winch on

429
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,030
the purple flower and came here to grab

430
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,070
one she intends to use to give to chawla

431
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,050
back his Panther powers but then after

432
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,730
that that's it right no more flowers no

433
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,920
more Panthers after Jala right we start

434
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,810
this throne room scene upside down as a

435
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,280
very subtle way of reminding the

436
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,110
audience that here in Wakanda things are

437
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,360
currently upside down the new king is a

438
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,600
yes damn it tell me to stop taking all

439
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,260
these sins off dude he's just lying

440
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,940
there probably dead that's entirely

441
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,560
possible given the proximity of the

442
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,090
mountains to the waterfall one of our

443
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,920
fishermen found him at the edge of the

444
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,470
river board ah he brought him to me and

445
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,060
I didn't tell anyone like for however

446
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,710
long it took for kill monger to get red

447
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,390
dirted and purple planted and then go up

448
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,800
and change clothes and then go into the

449
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,540
throne room and order weapons sent to

450
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,190
the war dog spot yeah I didn't see

451
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,260
anyone that whole time I just assumed

452
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,090
you guys would deduce that he was still

453
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,740
alive and up here in the mountains and

454
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,300
come here to retrieve it now you have

455
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,220
amazing I can heal him there

456
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,320
thank you you'll be dead in seconds damn

457
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,580
everyone in this country seems to be

458
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,230
able to diagnose and heal anyone with

459
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,910
impunity well how the herb that gives a

460
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,560
normal human superpowers is now going to

461
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,880
serve double duty as an herb that

462
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,740
flat-out heals mortally wounded dudes

463
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,900
near death he let the fifth of how I

464
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,090
discovered he stopped us from doing what

465
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,860
it's right this is the same realization

466
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,210
Chris and I had just before starting

467
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,960
cinemasins we not help you character

468
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,370
insists they won't do a thing only to

469
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,810
change their mind off screen in a few

470
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,070
minutes of movie time and do that very

471
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,690
thing cliche you know they made it seem

472
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,340
like Shuri ran this entire country's

473
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,810
tech during the whole movie and Baku

474
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,740
even called her out in the first

475
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,120
challenge so how are they able to put

476
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,740
this massive effort of the weapons

477
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,210
distribution together without it

478
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,590
all that challenge

479
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,740
I'm the king now but everyone can see

480
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,120
the childhood right and everyone knows

481
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,100
the challenge rules so why is everyone

482
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,750
doing what kill monger sent they can't

483
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,860
wait for it to charla to walk across the

484
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,220
field

485
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,100
Makati back to this clown this entire

486
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,570
movie has been about kill monger and his

487
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,279
killin boner for T'Challa but now that

488
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,020
he sees he's clearly still alive he

489
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,900
tells what copy to do it

490
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,460
boy I escalated quickly I know what

491
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,900
cobby was pissed at T'Challa for not

492
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,580
killing Klaw but his willingness to kill

493
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,170
what was his best friend until like a

494
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,480
week ago is jari ah cool we're all gonna

495
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,920
stop fighting and patiently wait for the

496
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,750
over CGI'd rhinos to show up and make

497
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,070
this otherwise excellent movie into a

498
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,200
show Donnell rhinos take this movie into

499
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,610
full-on Lord of the Rings mode for the

500
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,779
finale and that's not a good thing first

501
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,339
off when did Sheree have time to make

502
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:29,930
this American style and how does that

503
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,130
even an option and what does that even

504
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,960
mean it's not what the US only has one

505
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,550
type of AB rhenium powered aircraft in

506
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,190
fact I'm pretty sure we don't have any

507
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,320
laser pause okay I know I've hit the CGI

508
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,670
in this movie hard and it totally

509
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,170
deserves it but this is just egregious

510
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,520
we've literally fallen into a pit of

511
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,410
cliche darkness with a large dose of

512
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,120
rubber neo and a healthy amount of Sam

513
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,500
versus Saint you're better than this

514
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,750
movie you'll want to see us become just

515
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,160
like the people you hate so much

516
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,870
couldn't the China at least mention that

517
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,100
he's had a change of heart that wants to

518
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,600
help the world now isn't that worth a

519
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,860
shot before someone gets killed again

520
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,920
you mean my love oh yeah I remember that

521
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,870
these two are I don't know dating I

522
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,339
guess because this has no bearing on

523
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,600
anything that happens in this movie

524
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,339
until now barely in the ocean

525
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,600
well my assess is that jump from ships

526
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,760
because they know death was better than

527
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,560
bondage so everything went back to

528
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,030
normal after that enormous fight all

529
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,680
those wakandans that died for the super

530
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,540
quick rule of kill monger or just it we

531
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,700
all cool now once up again the king of

532
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,010
Wakanda now making out on a very public

533
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,450
street attracts no interest from the

534
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:35,540
common folk Bucky

535
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,850
[Music]

536
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,810
it's becoming my club don't get me

537
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,080
everybody dies every memory you see

538
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,300
pretty well it just so happens that your

539
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,180
friend here is only mostly dead it's a

540
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,280
big difference between mostly dead and

541
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,250
all that I chose my people but I don't

542
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,520
want your life who led him to the heart

543
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,880
shaped up

544
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,600
[Music]

545
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,679
I was wondering what would break first

546
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,440
spirit Oh

547
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,709
[Music]

548
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,539
your arms off now it isn't well what's

549
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,000
that then
