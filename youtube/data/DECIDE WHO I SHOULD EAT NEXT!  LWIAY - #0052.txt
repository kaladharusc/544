00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,640
I think this is really how

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,440
I'm going to

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,680

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,700

cards what I need to do now I think what

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,809
I need to do what's right for me is to
eat more children especially children

21
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:44,309

for 60 million subscribers imagine be peer pressured
by 9 year olds to eat paper

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,700
peer pressure had nothing to do with it it
was my own free (word) okay I wanted

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,700
to eat the child and it was great plus
there's nothing wrong with a 28 year old

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,079
man being pressured by a bunch of kids
to do something there's nothing wrong

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,630
