the waves are huge I didn't serve not

43
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,220
because I'm afraid of the great white or

44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,959
because this sign says no swimming I

45
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,150
just remember it's on the surfboard or a

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,090
