1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,500
41 seconds of logos you know what this

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,059
Disney Fox merger goes through there's a

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,559
good chance it's going to result in even

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,389
longer opening logo sequences with even

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,710
more logos per film and that's gonna

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,390
suck I don't know what you're thinking

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,939
oh no Falls in a cage how did this

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:21,539
happen

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,320
for Asian I met Hugh someone get this

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
skeleton an agent because it has

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,880
tremendous dramatic timing Oh son of

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,550
Odin holy SH that's Clancy Brown things

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,809
just got about a hundred times more

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,760
parallax up in this joint also this is

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,690
what happens when you open up your

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,550
superhero Cinematic Universe to aliens

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,500
gets wonky and cartoony in a hurry

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,329
just ask Steppenwolf who incidentally is

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,430
also a giant on fire alien monster I

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,020
cannot die

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,600
not until I fulfill my destiny and lay

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,730
waste to your own what I should be

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,680
destiny for him and everyone else he's

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,539
like an intergalactic air B&amp;B nightmare

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,840
and you have seen Ragnarok the full of

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
Asgard Ragnar roll credits the great

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,850
prophecy prophecies also great

28
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,770
prophecies oh oh we'll burn this entire

29
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,840
opening scene is villain monologuing

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,880
done to the extreme not that you're off

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,950
your head and stashing away NASCAR's

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,630
fault right next to the thing this guy

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,310
wants needs to combine it with are you

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,070
crazy

35
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,630
hammer porn though I'd caution you not

36
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,670
to search a real porn website for Hammer

37
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,320
porn unless you like Smashbox and

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
improvised dildos why not start with

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,770
that when I wasted the 25 seconds

40
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,420
individually smashing enemies if you can

41
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,869
do this

42
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,640
did he just like level up or something

43
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,380
Wow for thoroughly beat Surtur's ass

44
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,000
here I'm wondering what was the point of

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,619
keeping Thor prisoner why not just kill

46
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,850
him wouldn't that probably be an

47
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,930
important step in fulfilling the

48
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,670
prophecy the certain aura that Thor will

49
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,930
make the right decision to put his horns

50
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,670
on the eternal flame later the Odin

51
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,440
charged hog-tie with negligence of duty

52
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,810
by he disappeared before the trial

53
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,340
goddamn scourge do you ever stop

54
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,259
expositing you were literally telling

55
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,670
those girls plot stuff before Thor

56
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,050
arrived and now you're telling him pot

57
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,640
stuff I'm supposed to announce you

58
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,450
arrived goth dude there is no point in

59
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,190
jogging to the city to arrive 10 minutes

60
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,450
after Thor like you've accomplished

61
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,670
something also note to Asgard invest in

62
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,769
intercoms and all radios or shorter

63
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,410
bridges I'm sorry about this thing with

64
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,660
the tesseract between this Eurotrip Jay

65
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,130
and Silent Bob strike back finding

66
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,600
Forrester and entourage I'm thinking

67
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,920
Matt Damon has a shot at the best

68
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,330
collection of cameos a war that doesn't

69
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,670
exist do me a favor look this way in the

70
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,959
vault so it doesn't turn into a giant

71
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,880
monster and destroy the whole planet the

72
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,410
one thing that can fulfill the prophecy

73
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,760
of Surtur changing into mecha godzilla

74
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,799
is kept in the only place where it can

75
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,329
cause harm this is like if you buried

76
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,730
parallax in the pet cemetery also planet

77
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,380
planet at the end of this thing we will

78
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,090
see your entire civilization as a city

79
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,620
floating through space on a jagged rock

80
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,600
it's a comet or an asteroid way before

81
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
it's a fucking planet the male and

82
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
female actors behind Thor here are

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,430
associate faking conversation so

84
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,840
important you would ignore the first

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,519
appearance by thorne years that I'm

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,720
wondering if they want a contest to

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,150
appear in this scene not one job just

88
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,130
the one that's true but also Thor can

89
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,750
fly which can't really be this guy's

90
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,370
fault damn it if you were worried about

91
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,750
Thor return to Asgard without you

92
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,799
knowing it you should have picked a

93
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,140
better hero leave it alive it's why in

94
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,310
general you can never take death

95
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,810
seriously in these movies big dramatic

96
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,609
death scenes turn into parody plays

97
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,650
starring Matt Damon and you don't have a

98
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,410
phone no I don't have a phone but you

99
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,359
could have sent a electronic letter it's

100
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,950
called an email while this banter is

101
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,570
pretty funny you've got to think Doctor

102
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,040
Strange has ways of communicating that

103
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,870
don't involve phones or emails look at

104
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,810
this place it's beautiful Wow Norway it

105
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,340
looks fake --is-- no I've stopped

106
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,260
Ragnarok I put an end to sir it's

107
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,699
already begun she's coming

108
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,560
Odin who is thousands of years old plays

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,550
the pronoun game so

110
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,050
the Thor has to ask who the hell she is

111
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,130
kind of suggests hello no sister

112
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,330
how does Odin have a daughter that he's

113
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,190
kept secret all this time and while he

114
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,420
admitted he screwed up by not telling

115
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,950
Thor about her and what she can do

116
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,180
this sounds more like the type of thing

117
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,620
where the character of Odin didn't know

118
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,310
about her either

119
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,420
until the script for this movie was

120
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,730
written couldn't stop it so I'm prisoner

121
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,440
isn't that virtually the same thing a

122
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,330
crazy universe we live in when someone

123
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,770
can imprison a person with magic but

124
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,120
can't stop that person with the same

125
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,510
magic I'm a different person now

126
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,300
yes you must face alone well thanks dad

127
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,590
you created this mess by your own

128
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,880
admission and then you waited until you

129
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,200
were this close to death to even tell us

130
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,060
about it goddamn space Catwoman is hot

131
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,680
okay so if Hellas power is drawn from

132
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,359
Asgard how is he able to do this on

133
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,070
earth Odin told us her powers would be

134
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,989
limitless on Asgard so how is this not

135
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,200
already limitless this not possible why

136
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,350
did Hemsworth decide to channel chatter

137
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,970
for this scene I have it on good

138
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,440
authority that this script started out

139
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,060
as Maleficent too and this is the only

140
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,320
thing that survived from the first draft

141
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,300
two mythical beings will now resort to

142
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,470
punching each other while flying through

143
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:35,950
a wormhole

144
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,570
that's what Einstein what a woman Moody

145
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,800
casually kills a couple of Thor's

146
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,300
buddies and it should be a lot more

147
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,560
meaningful to us because of what they

148
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,210
mean to Thor but it simply is a Thor

149
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,830
crash lands on a planet full of trash

150
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,600
and tell me this isn't the same place

151
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,980
where the Transformers found themselves

152
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,750
and the Transformers the movie we're

153
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,160
about to hear dare to be stupid during a

154
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,610
fight scene the player dragged a rock

155
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,700
somehow all this mrs. Thor

156
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,960
it's kind of crazy how little this movie

157
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,730
has to do with Ragnarok it's like a side

158
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,710
quest that you play in a Thor RPG if you

159
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,419
had the time when we last saw hell she

160
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,950
was at the Bifrost gate man had killed

161
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,460
two people

162
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,110
now she's deep into the city surrounded

163
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,330
by a giant army of Asgardians what

164
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,800
exactly transpired where she walked from

165
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,120
one end of the city to the other and

166
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,140
drew this kind of an audience without

167
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,250
the army trying to attack her

168
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,200
immediately I thought you'd be happy to

169
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,780
see me maybe give them I don't know any

170
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,680
kind of proof that you're actually

171
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,390
Odin's offspring and maybe they'll come

172
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,720
around

173
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,430
you just said some now you seem shocked

174
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,020
no one believed you what is even the

175
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,730
point here she defeated and banished

176
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,440
Thor and Loki with 10% of the effort

177
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,940
she's putting forth here dispatching the

178
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,100
generic Asgardian army can't she just do

179
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,240
something that doesn't make this movie

180
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,760
over two hours long the answer is Sekar

181
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,530
it's awfully nice for this planet to

182
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,850
have the infrastructure to put prisoners

183
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,650
through a virtual Epcot Center ride that

184
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,910
gives them all the details they need to

185
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,350
know about the planet they're on it is

186
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,110
the collection point for all

187
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,420
lost and unloved things not true because

188
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,950
I see neither my college Temple of the

189
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,170
dog CD nor my college self one of which

190
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,910
was lost and one of which was unloved so

191
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,950
the rumors are true every 20 years or so

192
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,240
Jeff Goldblum emerges from his

193
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,100
hibernation to feed mate appear in

194
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,690
movies and become a big deal for three

195
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,340
to four years before going back into the

196
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,020
ground in 20 more years he'll be in the

197
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,000
Avengers infinity Star Wars and be the

198
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,530
priest at the Han Solo Peter quill

199
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,030
wedding you don't need to be afraid

200
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,310
unless you're made of scissors see just

201
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,990
a little ruck papers as a joke for you

202
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,300
in space way out in space they still do

203
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,130
rock-paper-scissors I'll do another yeah

204
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,440
oh well I tried to start a revolution

205
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,480
but didn't print enough pamphlets so

206
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,020
hardly anyone turned up there's no one

207
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,580
been taught oh history you've been

208
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,900
banished for decades but you finally

209
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,310
come home expect the society that

210
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,750
banished you to have taught your story

211
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,610
to impressionable kids scourge somehow

212
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,810
avoids getting his head smashed in by

213
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,220
all that sealing that just crashed down

214
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,180
with the eternal flame you are reborn

215
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,070
that's exactly what this person who has

216
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,810
so much power she can take out an entire

217
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,390
army by herself needs an army also this

218
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,040
eternal flame has a ton of uses doesn't

219
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,600
it it's how certain will become a huge

220
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,980
Colossus when he puts his horns in it

221
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,270
and it can raise an army of the undead

222
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,010
it's one of those weird elements and

223
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,360
movies that do whatever you need it to

224
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,950
do at a moment's notice it's so useful

225
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,150
it makes you wonder why I hasn't been

226
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,520
used until now Oh green glowing army of

227
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,200
the Dead and cate blanchett but lord of

228
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,250
the rings similarity well this movie

229
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,470
think of next

230
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,580
[Music]

231
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,750
movie soundtrack briefly thinks it's

232
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,830
running underneath the Blade Runner

233
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,480
sequel the Grandmaster created this

234
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,860
place to be whatever he wanted to to be

235
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,660
so why did he create a world where the

236
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,580
sheet glitchy hologram exists Chris

237
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,350
Hemsworth is way way better looking than

238
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,040
me

239
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,060
[Music]

240
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,060
[Applause]

241
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,560
he's pretty funny isn't it yeah I took

242
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,660
it off this is - okay haha we all

243
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,949
remember what Hulk did to Loki in the

244
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,599
Avengers but he's been here for weeks

245
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,800
and he's in good standing with the

246
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
Grandmaster so how does he not know the

247
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,009
Hulk is here after weeks of being on

248
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,270
this planet he would have at least been

249
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,620
given the description of this guy right

250
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,050
Oh better I never thought I would say

251
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,449
this but I I'm happy to see you you've

252
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,680
definitely know better than to address

253
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,270
Hulk this banner or to think one can

254
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,099
influence the other all right this is

255
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,990
what we've been waiting for Hulk vs Thor

256
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,849
we haven't seen this ever except in the

257
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,560
first Avengers on the airship and Thor

258
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,729
had his hammer folks should probably

259
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:53,990
make quick work of Thor under those

260
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,460
circumstances since it was essentially a

261
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,229
draw the first time but probably not

262
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:58,759
over three minutes of marginally

263
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,470
thrilling no stakes gladiator fighting

264
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,210
between two Avengers basically space

265
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,400
Civil War on a smaller scale Civil War

266
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,050
sliders if you will I'm sorry is this

267
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,159
hammer supposed to have the power of

268
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,199
Thor's real hammer Hulk just threw Thor

269
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,030
like a tennis ball a second ago and now

270
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,770
with a random huge hammer Thor is able

271
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,599
to bat Hulk around like Bryce Harper in

272
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,159
a little league game well they finally

273
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,349
did it they turn Thor into Raiden

274
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,699
wouldn't the ability to shock Thor be

275
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,139
impossible at this point since he's got

276
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,819
the power of lightning at his fingertips

277
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,069
tell me about yourself scourge you see

278
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,780
we need to fill some time while Thor and

279
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,729
the others try to get off Sekhar I don't

280
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:32,839
have much of a character other than I'm

281
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,250
evil and want to rule the universe so

282
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,899
you need to fill in the gaps have a gun

283
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:38,209
slinger let me say feel welcome to Zion

284
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,540
how'd you arrive here

285
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,820
we're good that still doesn't answer the

286
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,620
question yeah the Quinn jet can be used

287
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,270
to fly in space but of all the places in

288
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,560
the universe Hulk could have flown that

289
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,000
Quinn jet the fact that he just happens

290
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,730
to be on this planet is 2009 JJ Abrams

291
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,200
Star Trek Spock cave level of

292
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
improbability where is the Quinjet now

293
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,380
showing where the Quinn jet is will

294
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,150
require a naked halt to simply point out

295
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,710
the window rather than just telling Thor

296
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,600
were to look behind all vision is super

297
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,010
convenient did we even know this was

298
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,630
possible that Heimdall could bring

299
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,210
someone to Asgard via vision this

300
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,240
doesn't work Frank

301
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,220
The Avengers simple four didn't see that

302
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,870
did you I don't know how this remote

303
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,160
worked so that it would release him from

304
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,480
the chakra thing the button he's

305
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,650
pressing here is no different from what

306
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,120
Valkyrie pressed to shock him earlier

307
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,770
and considering how this movie works I'm

308
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,150
surprised he's in shock himself for a

309
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,810
big laugh Point Break good thing this

310
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,400
ship is still totally functional after

311
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,870
being here on this joke planet for

312
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,780
nearly two years this is not what she

313
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,670
said in age of Ultron and that movie she

314
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,080
said the job was finished and absolutely

315
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,550
nothing about the whereabouts of Ultron

316
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,810
it's almost like this movie needed an

317
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,310
easy reference for which movie this was

318
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,990
from so they invented an alternate

319
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,400
recording just for the scene why does

320
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,990
this old miss it from Black Widow causes

321
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,790
transformation back to banner now but

322
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,790
didn't do so when she originally sent it

323
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,010
to you yeah about that how does banners

324
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,900
demeanors stay sufficiently angry even

325
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,970
during sleep to stay holed for two years

326
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,460
if you were to give me 12 hours I could

327
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,990
bring them both back to you alive I

328
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,640
could do in two what is this name that

329
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,770
tune just both go and try and do it

330
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,660
Jesus is there any reason only one of

331
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,920
them would get sent after Thor and Hulk

332
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,110
I just don't get Loki at all he has all

333
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,550
these illusions at his fingertips but

334
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,840
instead of using that he's like a guy

335
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,400
from death wish trying to rob Charles

336
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,250
Bronson I'm sorry must be very painful

337
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,080
memory Loki taps into the mind of

338
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,910
Valkyrie to see the trailer for Valkyrie

339
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,470
not to be confused with the Tom Cruise

340
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,060
tries to kill Hitler movie this is just

341
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,570
gorgeous

342
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,220
everything about this scene is rat would

343
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,330
you stop saying

344
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,490
thing I said out loud somehow comes out

345
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,110
of characters mouth at the same time

346
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,190
well isn't that the most convenient

347
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,780
appearance ever not only is Valkyrie

348
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,580
find a way to go to the exact place she

349
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,960
needed to be at this moment but the

350
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,460
beast that was about to hit Thor also

351
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,440
had a controlling device on his neck is

352
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,630
that a dragon fact more importantly are

353
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,860
those grapes kind of amazing that the

354
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,150
grand master allowed Valkyrie to

355
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,650
continue to have control over all these

356
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,300
prisoners after she sold them to him why

357
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,350
doesn't he have his own controlling

358
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,580
devices on them once the sale is

359
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,830
complete we are not doing get help

360
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,540
characters do the thing that they said

361
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,560
they wouldn't do immediately after

362
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,060
saying they wouldn't do it cliche I

363
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,730
should figure this out it's just another

364
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,910
spaceship well that was easy

365
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,380
that's right you can stand on top of a

366
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,970
spaceship that explodes not gonna hurt

367
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,010
at all and by some sort of magic you can

368
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,540
get thrown to another ship and grab it

369
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,010
by the seams as it hurtles through the

370
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,900
air how are all these ships missing

371
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,850
Valkyrie Mario jumps her way across the

372
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,440
bad guy ships to do some miracles and

373
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,770
it's super fun your PhD okay movie you

374
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,550
can't have it both ways

375
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,020
you can't wring comedy from banner

376
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,640
shouting about how hard it should be for

377
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,440
him to fly an alien spaceship then have

378
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,760
him fly it perfectly for the rest of the

379
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,000
movie

380
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,640
um no even the special effects think

381
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,330
this is bullshit

382
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,050
guys this movie has more utterances of

383
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,300
the word anus than most anal porn or

384
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,830
even most proctology lectures

385
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,370
well execution does she have any reason

386
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,420
to have kept him around

387
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,830
she hasn't relied on him for local

388
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,570
knowledge he's not any stronger than the

389
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,400
next Asgardian she can execute people

390
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,320
herself quite easily his character is

391
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,550
here so that he can have a change of

392
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,870
heart at the end but I can't think of a

393
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,520
single purpose he serves for hella other

394
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,930
than to stand and watch her listen while

395
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,640
she does and says expositional things

396
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,050
that we the audience need to learn

397
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,330
yeah the mountains heat signatures

398
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,250
people clustered together how is it so

399
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,750
easy for this ship to find the people

400
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,730
and thereby the Bifrost sword but the

401
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,130
god of death who flings daggers with her

402
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,050
brain and crushes magic hammers wasn't

403
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,190
able to find it until she threatened to

404
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,720
start beheading fools and someone told

405
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,700
her where it was wow she really did the

406
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,260
eyeball math on those doors perfectly

407
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,580
I'm not sure I understand Thor's

408
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,320
battle-plan here the last time he ran

409
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,180
into Hellas she started his hammer into

410
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,720
oblivion

411
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,920
he doesn't realize yet that he can

412
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,540
control his power without the hammer so

413
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,370
what's the plan yeah no one wanted to

414
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,810
see what happened next or anything how

415
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,730
in the did a slashing metallic weapon

416
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,710
caused that wound but no signs of damage

417
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,970
outside the eye

418
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,769
the wolf is immune to bullets because we

419
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,269
need a reason for banner who has been

420
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,130
useless as a character here to turn back

421
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:06,470
into the whole to know who I am this is

422
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,370
just plain awesome

423
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,660
even though Edward Norton did this in

424
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,920
the Incredible Hulk and it wasn't played

425
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
for laps I don't think I quite

426
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,829
understand how Bruce dying makes the

427
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,329
Hulk emerge but I think it's consistent

428
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:15,709
with what these movies are saying is

429
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,870
possible so I'm removing us into this

430
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,009
yeah no one wanted to see what happened

431
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,720
next anyway I'm the goddess of death

432
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,970
luckily this triggers Thor's Dumbledore

433
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,470
dreams so Odin can give him a message

434
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,430
from beyond the grave

435
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,920
or ether wherever Odin went that Hama

436
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,050
was to help you control your power to

437
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,089
focus it it's nevio source of strength

438
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,740
thanks dad you could have told me about

439
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,329
my power away before this literal ex

440
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:39,980
machina dream sequence but I realized

441
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,569
these revelations need to arrive and the

442
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,430
stupidest way possible our Scout is not

443
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,190
a place that was like Idaho so begins

444
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,930
one of the longest walks ever so that

445
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,190
the heroes can figure out how to fight

446
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,050
hello the truth about Ragnarok and the

447
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,459
very meaning of life before she arrives

448
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,699
long as God the more powerful she grows

449
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,560
hella has shown nothing but complete and

450
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,209
utterly infinite power since she first

451
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,560
showed up in this movie there isn't a

452
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,209
gauge for how much more power she can

453
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,010
attain she's shown zero weaknesses and

454
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,420
there isn't anything in her arsenal that

455
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,800
could be more effective this is never

456
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,930
about stopping Ragnarok this was about

457
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,149
causing Ragnarok well it's a good thing

458
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,620
you didn't take cinemasins advice and

459
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,940
take Surtur's crown light-years away

460
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,560
from this place but it's not like he

461
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,389
knew that then yes Loki's going to steal

462
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,010
this because Loki's got a Loki my

463
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,569
question is if he had free rein on

464
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,430
Asgard for as long as he did why hasn't

465
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,050
he already stolen this thing and used it

466
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,850
yeah good for you for finally doing the

467
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,290
right thing after all those times you

468
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,760
did the wrong and horrible thing almost

469
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,970
forgetting Karl Urban commando do you

470
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,740
really think it's a good idea to bring

471
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,110
me back to earth no especially since you

472
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,550
assholes already agreed it would be in

473
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,230
Loki's best interest to stay on Sekar

474
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,269
and you know Doctor Strange is going to

475
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,279
Chloe up once he arrives do you guys

476
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,630
forget everything in order to surface

477
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,130
the future plot because space is

478
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,110
apparently a one lane highway Thor's arc

479
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,910
runs into Thanos a ship on the way to

480
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,980
earth to infinity war and Beyond you

481
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,110
can't have a revolution without somebody

482
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,029
to overthrow so you're welcome and it's

483
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,680
a tie aren't you glad you waited through

484
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,360
ten minutes of credits to see that holy

485
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,220
crap so many revelations for the future

486
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,000
of Marvel there

487
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,710
man I am glad I prevented the ushers

488
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:16,790
from cleaning this movie for that ever

489
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,080
since cinemasins began the most

490
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
requested thing has been TV since and

491
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,110
now it's a reality click the link in the

492
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,730
description below to check it out and

493
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,610
now the audio outtakes but the animal is

494
