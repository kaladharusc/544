00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,330
this place looks like a winner

28
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,290
that's budget restaurant in San Francisco you're on a budget diner food

29
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,290
for breakfast

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,900
that's 931 my flights at 1125

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,610
it's a half an hour drive from here at the gas in the rental car drop off the

32
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,510
rental car

33
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,769

34
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,330

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
for you

36
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,940
this is a canon g7x mark - this is my little brother's g7x mark -

37
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,120
after he dropped off his motorcycle

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,030
it looks like when we tried to take a bite out of it and the lens captures

39
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,640
John look at this mess

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,580

43
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,510
thank you very much thank you my time the food was good i would say it was a

44
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,190
solid seven or an eight but as far as the most economical restaurant

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,989
it was like thirty-six dollars for two of us so no matter what the hell they're

46
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,989
talking about this

47
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,950
if I miss my play it will be because I stopped for gas

48
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,690
but if I don't stop for gas i gotta pay the current a place like 50 bucks i'm

49
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,970
just not doing it

50
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,330
I'm gonna be good luck on your trip don't ask your bike ride

51
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:37,520

62
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,839
I got this I'm glad I stopped for gas I'm glad I had breakfast and i'm glad i

next stop is the monorail trolley thing to take me to the terminal

66
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,620
whoa no no no

67
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:01,449
that's gonna cost me

68
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,110
more

69
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,880

70
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,390

72
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,920

thing you can write that in here

76
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,210
but you get one that's a little unfair right I work here and

77
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,040
it is

78
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,430
I understand all the urgency is gone

79
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm entirely home free now flight takes off in 20 minutes on two minutes away

80
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,620
from the gate

81
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,300
everything is good I see that we have the kit because fun

82
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,430
see you later

83
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,010

84
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,520
also our place in the hard I love that

85
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,420
now before we take off there's something I need to tell you something I've been

86
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,770
hiding from you

87
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,700
so far this because every time this happens everybody in the comments get

88
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,660
super mad at me

89
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,840
I don't know why they get that need to get super mad at me with this happens

90
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,660
but

91
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,660
I crashed another drug

92
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:45,020
what is it good the drone total really like gimbal here is completely bent this

93
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,800
part this part right here that's not supposed to look like that at all

94
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,460
that's total broke the leg off there

95
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,420
this is all separated this broke out of here

96
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,100
even cracked whatever that is so I was flying it through the trees getting that

97
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,660
awesome like Star Wars shot when I cleared the trees which is awesome

98
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,660
I wanted to bring it way up to to fly it back and I couldn't see that there is a

99
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,940
tree behind me and it like caught the very top of the tree and then just rock

100
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,110
and roll this way

101
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,110
probably a hundred and fifty feet down and into a huge fireball explode

102
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,330
there is no explosion but it crashed and broke least six week is the longest I've

103
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,690
ever had one of these things so I can't consider it a failure

104
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,820
I just think that just has a copy out there were no people anywhere near this

105
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,900
drone flight

106
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
no one was ever put at rest or anything like that

107
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:48,440
another drone and hit hard but at least you have another extra battery and have

108
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,780
you seen what my ipad looks like that

109
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,830
I mean every time I skateboard and run at the same time I crash

110
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,880
that just shattered this leg into a million pieces every time just keep

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,630
taking it back together

112
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,209
that's what happened not a big deal

113
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,040
going to get another one

114
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,040
sleeping at the foot

115
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,570
Oh

116
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,870
yeah

117
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:40,179
you know it's light out now and I feel like by the time I get home

118
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,179
it's gonna be dark out and that makes me a little bit sad

119
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
like I missed a whole day

120
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:57,329
Oh

121
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,139
and just like that it's dark out

122
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,590
totally understand happy to get off my skateboard

123
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,160
I comply I mean come on she was on a Segway
