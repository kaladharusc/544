talking misogyny I'm gonna be honest

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,790

misogynistic now I'm never met her I

60

well I mean I won't give a shout-out to

122
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,930
my son I've handled if the football

123
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,760
seasons coming up it's his senior year

124
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,280
and his he don't play they don't play

125
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,890
football he's a flag boy or it calls

126
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,360
himself a flag girl that's all right

127
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
whatever that's all right however he

128
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,690
identifies with flags is fine with me

129
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,390
and his boyfriend is quarterback this

130
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,070
year so we're hoping hoping he gets a

131
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,740
scholarship and takes my boy Jesse jr.

132
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,150
off to college with them you know that's

133
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,830
what we're hoping he's turning 18 this

134
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,840
year right I think he's turning 18 and

135
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
then college next year I suppose and

136
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,720
then what team but I don't know are they

137
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,340
for this year was that the text arcade

138
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,020
of titans is that him yeah well they're

139
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,210
playing in tax Arcana where we were the

140
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,980
text Arcana Titans but they decided that

141
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,740
wasn't PC no more so we changed it to

142
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,850
the text arc

143
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,030
our text Arkana tall ones is what we're

144
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,740
calling them now and I think they're

145
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,030
just gonna change I think next year

146
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,900
they're probably gonna take away the

147
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,160
tall part because they don't want to be

148
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,230
yeah discriminatory towards people

149
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,640
without height so I think it's just

150
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,070
gonna be the ones text Arcana one yeah I

151
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,650
don't know man if you you call yourself

152
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,840
the ones that seems like that as bad as

153
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,850
it's going that seems exploitable to me

154
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,950
you know I'm not naming the team I just

155
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,960
I root for me I didn't I didn't name a

156
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,970
major I just root for my ball place for

157
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,620
them and then next year it's gonna be

158
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,350
the Razorbacks coming up well I mean I

159
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,910
hope they got a good flag boy - flag

160
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,360
girl program but I think I think his his

161
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,950
boyfriend's gonna do real well the

162
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,850
University of Arkansas

169
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,680
really honestly I don't really care much

170
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,690
about yeah I mean that's fine you know

171
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,610

172
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,530
ain't necessarily good what I thought

173
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,120
he's gonna be good at cuz we threw the

174
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,040
ball around a lot when he was kid and he

175
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,560
never did catch a damn thing when it

176
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,330
came to a baton he took to that like a

177
