1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,710
oh holy shit guys oh my god

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,660
look at this this story is huge analyst

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,839
predicts is battlefield 5 would be a

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,270
serious disappointment says pre-orders

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,010
lag Call of Duty buy more than 85 Pro

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,570
sent Wow

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,740
well well oh my god guys

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,680
Cohen believes that EA's battle-field 5

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,440
may put the company's financial guidance

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,879
at risk

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,920
holy you reap what you sow now I see it

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,300
now I see it Wow so I'm guys what could

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,989
explain this it has to be the you know

14
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,530
the anti social justice movement well

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,480
actually no I go back to my original

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,930
point it's actually a number of factors

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,000
like in my original video I said it is a

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,460
number of factors but nobody really had

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,979
specific numbers where does this guy get

20
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,810
his specific numbers I wish that they

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,460
would share this kind of stuff with us

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,909
but but apparently he has access to know

23
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,490
that pre-orders lag Call of Duty buy

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,750
more than 85% that is HUGE is that over

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,360
is that overall is that on the consoles

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,200
only is that on PC am I gonna be playing

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,119
on an empty server this is wow this is

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,759
big and don't don't do you better not

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
stop talking about that's what I said

30
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,390
you didn't listen to my video at all

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,729
that's what I was saying there are weak

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,950
preorder sales and there are a number of

33
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,530
reasons why it's gonna feel it's gonna

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,320
be lower okay but oh man I can see it

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,969
now so yeah I mean we need to talk about

36
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,680
the fucking game we need to talk about

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,229
whether battlefield 5 is gonna be a good

38
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,689
game at all or whether the servers are

39
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,020
gonna be empty or whether EA is gonna go

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,000
out of business for this no I mean

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,140
they're not gonna go out of business for

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,460
this but maybe they'll fucking axe

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,830
we change as a company maybe they'll be

44
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,960
like oh shit man that blowback for them

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,010
from the Star Wars Battlefront 2 debacle

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,510
has really ruined our reputation amongst

47
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,710
the fans sticking it battlefield

48
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,450
constantly trying to compete against

49
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,390
call of duty year in and year out in the

50
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,920
same area maybe we should just

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,690
completely move battlefield to a

52
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,330
different month why why do they have to

53
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,860
fight at the same time why does broked

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,140
Ober have to be broke Tober move your

55
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,240
fucking game to a different month that

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,780
is barren like July August like nothing

57
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,420
came out July August everybody's out of

58
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,300
school everybody's gone my hats and make

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,970
reviews and there's nothing like small

60
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,100
indie games and I do indira views and

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,820
nobody watches them in their life come

62
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,010
on guys we meet some major games in

63
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,900
july/august even though that's kind of

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,350
where I take a break - it's summer man

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,050
but you know what the hell is busy a

66
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,060
gonna do maybe they'll change as a

67
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,970
company and I think that new story about

68
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,270
you know Patrick Sutherland you know

69
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,400
leaving the company but they really

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,190
wanted to retain him is is Perez bunk

71
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,860
it's probably bullshit man it took me a

72
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,050
while to find it EA gave out going is

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,150
expat rexella and a 20 million dollar

74
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,010
bonus and here's why the publisher

75
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,010
really wanted him to say this is bunk

76
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,110
why would they want him to stay if it's

77
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,930
if if battlefield 5 is lagging behind

78
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,910
85% and then they are in serious

79
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,760
financial danger why would you want to

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,130
give him 20 million for a long-term

81
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,210
retention of this guy oh my god this

82
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,490
this dud this feels so good cuz this is

83
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,920
the same guy that there was leading the

84
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,350
initiative to put in all the madden

85
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,570
ultimate team and FIFA Ultimate Team

86
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,610
into the other games and he wanted to

87
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,910
pay him twenty million dollars to keep

88
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,920
him longer or you already paid him

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,780
twenty million dollars and he took off I

90
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,140
hope that he you did pay him twenty

91
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,990
million and he took off because that

92
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,460
that that is really huge mismanagement

93
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,580
ei is fuckin up hard left and right and

94
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,370
we we should be celebrating it we should

95
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,130
all be laughing it at them for it but I

96
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,069
I hope that you know it doesn't

97
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,720
absolutely destroy you know here's

98
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,069
another thing and something I didn't

99
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:52,750
realize what if dice breaks off from ei

100
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,990
or shit does ei already like straight up

101
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,139
own them and owns their their you know

102
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,509
their studio yeah that's probably the

103
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,539
way it is ei probably already owns dice

104
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,389
and and there's no way to separate the

105
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,789
two you know you would have to literally

106
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,460
have a mass exodus of dice employees to

107
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,229
create Feist you know or slice and then

108
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,470
you know maybe we can get some some some

109
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,550
different things but Wow Wow let's take

110
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,909
a look this is gonna wake a up and it's

111
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:31,300
gonna possibly we'll get this the

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,699
battlefields that we want and the

113
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,330
majority of you know anti social justice

114
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,590
warriors wants you know without

115
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,000
political stuff being put into it you

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,530
think the next Battlefield game is gonna

117
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,840
have zero women do you think there will

118
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,969
still be women in multiplayer in the

119
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:51,039
next Battlefield game after this I have

120
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,710
no idea would it be okay to put women in

121
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,750
into the next battlefield and we would

122
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,479
get the same you know controversy know

123
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,710
if they move you know time periods so

124
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,039
that the historical accuracy argument is

125
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,590
is gone me personally the the

126
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,270
battlefield if you were to ask me what

127
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,490
battlefield I want the most which one

128
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,710
would I be super excited about where I

129
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,750
think the preorder sales would be high

130
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,599
as hell even though you probably should

131
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,490
free order but people pre-order anyway

132
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,139
no matter what I'd say or anybody else

133
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,630
says anyways is bad company three I

134
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,969
would love to see them go back to bad

135
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,000
company that's when it was so good and I

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,339
can't figure out why there was a video

137
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,810
on YouTube you should try to look it up

138
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,880
a review of Bad Company 2 or why

139
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,220
was bad company to so good I'll put a

140
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,100
link in there it's a good watch and it

141
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,780
brings back the nostalgia but it

142
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,340
actually I realized it actually is a

143
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,040
different style you know battlefield to

144
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,470
the previous ones and it's console so I

145
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,900
don't know how and then you know I don't

146
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,510
know how that would factor in but if you

147
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,640
want to do another one on PC we need to

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,520
do a PC port of that but maybe another

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,560
futuristic one battlefield 20 you know

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,490
no 22:38 you know something like that

151
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,680
would be really cool especially if you

152
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,290
factor in what you left out of Star Wars

153
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,230
Battlefront - like - spaceships and then

154
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,240
boarding and then like actual fighting

155
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,830
within the ship and then one ship dies

156
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,200
and so that would be cool as hell but I

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,580
don't know I think they just never went

158
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,080
back to futuristic because that one

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,690
didn't sell well because of the you know

160
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,580
of the whole the future theme I don't

161
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,350
really know or maybe that one was before

162
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,130
all the games kind of win future what

163
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,170
scenario what time period do you think

164
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,790
could bring the magic back to

165
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,630
battlefield

166
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,880
if battlefield 5 is going to be a

167
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,370
colossal disaster it's not yet maybe

168
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,230
this is still premature maybe breeders

169
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,000
will go up I don't know but it does seem

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,020
like like this is really bad right now

171
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,420
EA battlefield 5 currently appears to be

172
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,030
headed for serious disappointment and

173
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,490
it's front let the same issue happened

174
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,880
with battle no battlefront to Star Wars

175
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,530
Battlefront 2 was a serious

176
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,650
disappointment which caused EA's shares

177
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,590
to decline and then the controversy made

178
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,170
it even worse right now their shares

179
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,000
look they're not really declining that

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,090
much only 0.2% but holy shit those

181
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,570
shares are gonna drop hard once this

182
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,560
this game comes out so the it's October

183
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,979
19th between October 12th Call of Duty

184
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,320
and October 26 Red Dead Redemption this

185
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,969
is what I was saying it seems like Red

186
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,729
Dead Redemption 2 is taking the sort of

187
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,370
normal position on battlefield 5 because

188
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,590
Call of Duty is such a fucking

189
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,020
juggernaut that those sales are not

190
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,420
going to go down they're not gonna be

191
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,110
affected

192
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,260
I would love personally I'd love to see

193
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,500
what would happen if call of duty'

194
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,420
removed not only the single player but

195
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,110
also removed like zombies and and then

196
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,230
it was just multiplayer and and maybe

197
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,900
and just battle royale or maybe just

198
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,870
battle royale would that finally affect

199
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,810
sales how much would you have to take

200
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,660
out of the game and how much

201
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,680
microtransactions and season passes

202
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,200
would you really have to put into a Call

203
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,770
of Duty in order to actually affect its

204
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,110
sales now what I'm curious is is will

205
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,220
will EA you know change battlefield 5 at

206
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,200
all no I think it's just gonna really

207
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,140
you know release the way it is will they

208
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,300
change the next battlefield yeah I

209
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,060
definitely think they will so guys in

210
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,220
the comments put whatever battlefield

211
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,950
you want next cuz I bet you they're

212
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,810
gonna watch this video and your videos

213
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,150
tell if what battlefield you aren't next

214
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,250
cuz this is the time to do it if

215
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,230
battlefield 5 is headed for a major

216
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,550
disappointment now I don't I don't know

217
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,160
I would love to see real numbers this

218
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
suggests a meaningful risk factor for

219
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,000
EA's fiscal year guidance boy and that's

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,420
the thing that II ate is terrified yet

221
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,860
decline oh God

222
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,580
oh yeah okay this is good man this is

223
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,920
really good I mean it's you you never

224
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,150
want to say it's something good if

225
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,950
people are gonna lose their jobs over it

226
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,290
or there's gonna be you know there try

227
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,760
to shut down a studio but they're not

228
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,710
gonna you know if this comes out it's

229
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,860
disastrous dice I hope we'll be safe and

230
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,320
then we'll just move on and create the

231
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,620
next battlefield or the next game and

232
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,960
and then just listens a little bit more

233
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,720
to the community or goes to a different

234
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,110
time period and come you know but

235
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,090
whatever oh shit

236
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,070
this is huge alright guys tell me what

237
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,330
you think of this really quick news

238
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,460
story and I thought I'd do a video on

239
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,500
this since we just we're just talking

240
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,140
about this battle the battlefield 5

241
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,390
pre-orders and we're getting a little

242
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,820
bit more detailed information actual

243
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,970
numbers though I don't know

244
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,189

245
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:11,670
you need to be you know badged press or

so you know something in order to get to

247
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,649

248
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,350
be fascinating to share because I'm I

249
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,209
