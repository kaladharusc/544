00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,609
Oh Oh wouldn't it notice this hello

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,779
everybody my name is markiplier and

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,679
welcome to three retro horror games now

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,049
you probably know the developer of these

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,610
games or at least you know some of the

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,560
games that they've made before they have

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,840
made games like power drill massacre

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,600
babysitter bloodbath and other games and

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,970
her 80s inspired horror movie slash

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,640
games so this one that we're gonna start

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,239
out with is called nun massacre which I

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,370
can only assume doesn't mean that the

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,260
nuns are gonna be the ones that are

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,399
massacred it is me and the nuns are the

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,149
enemy

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,899
well maybe not baby maybe see other way

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,930
around what am i doing oh I'm taking a

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,430
bath oh I'm doing barrel rolls in the

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,640
back a little scrub-a-dub-dub in my tub

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:09,450
haha hi another thing about these ones

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,760
is that they're deceptively low fidelity

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,330
graphics and when I say deceptively I

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,009
mean deceptively low it may seem like

24
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,360
it's one of those games that's not

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,369
particularly well made I live in a

26
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,750

normally handle this

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,820

nice Hospital it's slowing me into a

266
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,240

492
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,410

493
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:51,550
do that no one knows I'm here no one

494
00:37:51,550 --> 00:38:06,720

500
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,400
that would get Appetit Deus after I

501
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,650

502
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,580
time to read it either oh this is where

503
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,700

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,510
that's real good about that when is he

507
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,880

508
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,030
gonna start coming after me toilet lid

509
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:03,130
fixed it for you boss it's using a lot

510
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,810
of the assets from the other games but

511
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,280
then again I think they probably do that

512
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,440
or maybe all those were leading up to

513
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,320
this one though okay hammer 80 ho then

514
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,100
why do I need a hammer I don't know why

515
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,510
I need a hammer can I bash that guy in

516
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,710

517
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:30,220

522
00:39:51,410 --> 00:40:14,530
[Music]

523
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:21,410
okay okay try to find my way out again

524
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,460
huh boy okay all right I don't know why

525
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,660
I'm here I don't know what I did wrong I

526
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,480
think that all of these games the three

527
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,280
games that I've been playing are somehow

528
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,230
connected which is odd but it's pretty

529
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,560
clear at the same time there's some

530
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,390
story that's being told I know when they

531
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,940
were developing this game they also made

532
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,430
the other ones as like small additional

533
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,560
games I don't know why hey let me

534
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,780
restart this because I think I fucked it

535
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,790
up okay now through the hole in this

536
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,800
time I'm not gonna be a stupid asshole

537
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,470
and I'm not gonna move where I shouldn't

538
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,560
go give me the lighter give me what I

539
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,599
need to close this up let's not leave

540
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,550
any suspicions oh wait it's not there

541
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,059
why is it not there

542
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:17,349
what I said out there well that's weird

543
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:22,839
oh okay all right then I guess we don't

544
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,609
have to worry about that for some reason

545
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,880
or another I have the paperclip nods

546
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,130
right there okay so so what about that

547
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:43,449
what's the sound meter for but that

548
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:52,490
wasn't locked before

549
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,960
no this is weird a rock okay well I got

550
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,170
another rock I don't know where to throw

551
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:15,680
the rock got some sleeping know what

552
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,800
that was so I need to bash this no I

553
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:44,570
need to bash that's good news don't do

554
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,280
that

555
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,830
so he unlocked the door and now I can

556
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:57,640
move on that's my understanding anyway

557
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,560
wasn't there a button for an alarm too

558
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,230
wasn't there an alarm button somewhere

559
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,580
over here like in one of these other

560
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,250
rooms I could've sworn I remember seeing

561
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,410
one it's simple but now that it's

562
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:15,320
unlocked I should be able to yeah

563
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,790
[Applause]

564
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,530
[Music]

565
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,010
let me go get the hammer let me go get

566
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:33,020
the hammer radar I don't need the radar

567
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,330
oh god they've randomized where the

568
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,080
things are

569
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,210
they've randomized a lot of things about

570
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:46,090
this okay

571
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,470
there's no gas pumping out of that thing

572
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,020
anymore which I suppose might be a good

573
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,270
thing but I'm not a Harmison sure what's

574
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:57,370
good and what's bad anymore hammer

575
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,630
there's no hammer then I forgot I don't

576
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:04,010

580
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:25,190
easy-peasy and nothing interesting here

581
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,329
oh hi okay a rock good another rock I

582
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:31,039

I've got another rock I mouse rat or

584
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:38,299
whatever you are a pile of flesh yeah

585
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:40,210

586
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:46,069

587
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:50,359

588

00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,440
the power drill massacre that's what

591
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,980

592
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:06,230
Oh God into the basement okay yeah I

593
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,760
think that's the room that I was in

594
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,880
before but I didn't know I don't know

595
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,839
where this guy is right now string of

596
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,299
convenience or abductions baffled police

597
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,400
yeah they baffle me too because I have

598
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,099
no idea where I am

599
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,349
shit okay there's an electrical box

600
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:28,329
screwed shut so we need to find a screw

601
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:35,089
oh no this was not the house okay so I

602
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:39,079
need to find like a screwdriver and wire

603
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,039
cutters probably oh boy that is enough

604
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,119
power okay let me go do something

605
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,829
drastic here I'm gonna trigger this

606
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,930
because hopefully he's gonna he's gonna

607
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:54,140
come out of something yeah and once he

608
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,760
comes out of somewhere then maybe I can

609
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,089
get into wherever he came out of what

610
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,380
was he coming out of that grid on the

611
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,460
door was I think yeah

612
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:16,040
No No how did you no no no no two days

613
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,560
remain huh well I don't have two days

614
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,380
unfortunately okay I'm gonna consider

615
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,010
this one on cause from not done not done

616
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,510
with this one because I've barely

617
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,340
scratched the surface of this one

618
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,370
but unfortunately my voice is just to

619
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,080
thrash to be able to continue that one

620
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,450
but this has been a long three scary

621
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,130
games so if you want to play any of

622
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,720
these games I'll put them down in the

623
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,020
description below they were all through

624
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,540
puppet combos patreon which is how

625
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,040
they're funding their projects which is

626
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,180
a really cool way to do it because

627
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,470
they're an indie developer I think

628
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,000
they're just a dream team of three

629
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,680
people and they're funding their games

630
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,720
just from patreon and they're really

631
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,340
cool games they're terrifying they're

632
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,120
horrifying

633
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,760
they're absolutely scary and that's cool

634
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,320
so thank you everybody so much for

635
