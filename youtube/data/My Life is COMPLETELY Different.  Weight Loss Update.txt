4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,870
and if I look like crap right now it's

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,150
cuz I kind of feel like crap cuz I slept

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,920
all of about two hours last night got

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,349
onto a plane super early Flute Arkansas

8
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,759
and now you're looking at me a few

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,990
minutes after getting off the plane well

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,100
I've been home for a little while did

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,930
some unpack and took a shower and now

12
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,369
I'm filming a rambling video to go up

13
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,930
today because I want to just talk to you

14
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,760
guys and talk to you about e3 and I know

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,900
a lot of you guys don't play video games

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,880
so bear with me I'm gonna talk about

17
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,769
video games a little bit in this but I'm

18
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,269
also gonna talk quite a bit about my

19
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,579
experiences as a person in my new body

20
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,219
and my new brain a newly single new

21
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,260
whatever and everything changed at this

22
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,690
e3 and what a cool experience it was so

23
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,980
for those you don't know the folks over

24
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,170
YouTube gaming specifically Geoff Keeley

25
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,239
who does their YouTube coverage and like

26
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,920
does the e3 Coliseum does all kinds of

27
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
crazy stuff during e3 um came out of the

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,030
creative summit Jeff Keely asked me to

29
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,430
come and do some of the YouTube live

30
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,140
coverage now as you guys know I do

31
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,940
Twitter I mean normally I would like Co

32
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,190
stream his stream and I would do it from

33
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,750
you know twitch from the comfort of my

34
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,399
own home but I always wanted to go to e3

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,769
it's a good excuse to go Jeff said he'll

36
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,750
make it worth it if I come out boy to

37
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,280
the team make it worth man I thought I

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,689
was gonna do like one or two segments

39
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,640
each day it was pretty much YouTube

40
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,860
gaming coverage with me on the hour

41
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,900
every hour it was I think was the most

42
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,520
used creator but of course everybody

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,659
else had two other engagements I was

44
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,130
pretty much just locked down to the

45
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,960
creator studio which is a good good

46
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,900
problem to have um and I got to do all

47
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,390
kinds of crazy segments stuff I was kind

48
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,340
of decent with you know I've worked with

49
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,049
language I work with I adjustment I just

50
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,189
need I've worked with Kyle boss Minh

51
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,810
worked with all these people before so

52
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,549
doing little reactions and roundtables

53
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,780
with them like that especially Jeff

54
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,130
Keely I'm very comfortable doing that

55
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,810
they did have me snooze something crazy

56
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,500
that I was not comfortable with at first

57
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,600
they wanted me to stand up and put a

58
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,210
microphone into fans faces and ask them

59
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,829
questions there's an opportunity for

60
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,530
trolling there someone did troll me they

61
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,759
said the game they were also excited

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,000
about was runescape but I think I

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
handled it pretty well I'm not I don't

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,369
seem to be on any of the cringe

65
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,320
compilations thanks to the folks at EA

66
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,530
and Ubisoft mostly for that but it

67
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,479
wasn't it wasn't I didn't screw it up I

68
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,710
was pretty excited about that so the

69
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,360
first couple of days we're pretty cool I

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,739
got to meet a lot of creators I got I

71
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,660
mean like ninja I gotta meet like ali-a

72
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,390
I gotta meet

73
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,100
our marshmallows in the room I got to

74
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,200
meet Hideo Kojima from Kojima

75
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
Productions got a picture with him

76
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,500
pretty amazing stuff I was kind of late

77
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,910
to the party for him I didn't really

78
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,940
play his games until PT and then PT blew

79
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,470
my mind so much I became interested so

80
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,420
I'm very excited about des training but

81
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,520
I didn't go to go I didn't go to go to

82
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,720
most of the shows I went to the police

83
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,100
station after party what a lot of a

84
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,320
after parties but I was pretty much in

85
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,720
the studio for the actual addresses the

86
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,610
actual shows so that I would be ready to

87
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,160
do live reactions to them there for the

88
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,010
live stream but it was really cool

89
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,830
watching them there on the live the the

90
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,500
YouTube live streaming stage with Jeff

91
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,240
Keeley with other creators with the crew

92
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,920
and listening to people react I think

93
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,630
probably the most beautiful moment for

94
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,920
this entire thing I took a picture of it

95
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,150
I tweeted out Jeff Keely when he finally

96
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,940
saw footage of death stranding he just

97
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,010
shot out of his chair and he like ran

98
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,200
over to a monitor and he starts texting

99
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,190
somebody I don't know who's texting

100
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,250
could I mean kijima himself I don't know

101
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,530
but he was so excited the mood was just

102
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,120
electric in that room it was a really

103
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,610
cool party atmosphere that I really

104
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,980
really enjoyed my goal like I said might

105
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,630
have already said this but my goal this

106
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,459
entire III was just not to end up on any

107
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,489
cringe compilations and I didn't and I'm

108
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:25,720
happy with that they told me I nailed it

109
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,310
I disagree but I hope you did see some

110
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,720
of the coverage if you don't there's a

111
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,700
the game slice channel if you do search

112
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,730
for my name and live YouTube III you'll

113
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,250
probably find him also because I was

114
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,380
feeling so good since all this physical

115
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,820
therapy with all this weight loss I was

116
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,680
feeling so good I also recorded my usual

117
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,420
videos on v3 they're up on the channel I

118
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,489
talked to my youtube rep because the

119
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,739
views were lower than normal for e3 she

120
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,360
summarizes there's a lot of competitions

121
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,130
stuff like that but she's also reminding

122
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,480
me the view counts are not getting added

123
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,530
up correctly so if you haven't seen

124
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,880
those videos you do want to see him I

125
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,040
would love it if you did it's also of

126
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,080
Kay if you don't it was just worth it

127
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,430
for the experience I just enjoyed

128
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,440
creating those videos and filming there

129
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,630
and and then doing III so when it came

130
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,600
to exploring I got to do quite a bit of

131
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,860
it I got to play Smash Brothers which

132
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,430
was really good I got to play a bit of

133
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,480
Kingdom Hearts gonna play a 20 minute

134
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
demo it was amazing I got to set in on

135
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,200
the cyberpunk 2077 experience and where

136
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,280
you don't actually get to play the game

137
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,470
you got like a 45 minute demo where they

138
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,060
play through the game for you and showed

139
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,660
you all the stuff was there

140
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,040
and I think I'm not supposed to say

141
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,470
everything I saw here's what I know that

142
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,340
I can say the game looked amazing um but

143
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,750
I'm going to go ahead and tell you that

144
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,230
I'm heavily biased because I love The

145
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,480
Witcher but I love CD Projekt RED I'm

146
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,040
friends with a lot of people over there

147
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,170
at the company I'm sorry I have to be

148
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,030
careful when I promote that game because

149
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,230
I do want to Pro out the game because it

150
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,520
was amazing but you should also check

151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,460
every other youtuber because I am biased

152
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,540
but it was my first time getting to meet

153
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,850
people on that team and some of us we've

154
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,320
exchanged emails four or five or six

155
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,360
years including my friend Peter who is

156
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,300
just an amazing artist who's done a good

157
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,920
amount of the art that I've used on

158
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,440
t-shirts and elsewhere so he's just a

159
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,600
great guy and he actually did the

160
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,730
presentation for us and so instead of

161
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,080
starting the presentation the way he was

162
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,550
supposed to he started it off with my

163
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,330
youtube intro he said what's up ladies

164
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,320
and gentlemen of e3

165
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,020
my name is Peter and brought to you by

166
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,540
the power of large airplanes and I know

167
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,050
it's super adorable and so it was is my

168
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,750
Rockstar moment of e3 not to mention

169
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,850
that of course I did have to rent one of

170
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,560
those stupid motor scooters I didn't use

171
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,630
it very frequently but I did use it to

172
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,040
get from place to place but then once I

173
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,330
was in a place I would get up and walk

174
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,950
around 10 20 30 minutes I went to the

175
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,810
fort night event I was on my feet for

176
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,920
two and a half hours because I couldn't

177
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,810
even bring the card anyway so I was on

178
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,920
my feet for two and a half hours I

179
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
probably walked a mile and a half I had

180
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
to be a little medicated to do it but my

181
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,260
mobility is through the roof I'm just

182
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,780
amazed at how much I'm able to do and

183
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,100
how much better I feel and how much less

184
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,380
sleep I need and how like less sick I

185
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,970
feel I do feel like a train wreck right

186
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,920
now but I'm just amazed that I'm able to

187
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,740
do this stuff and that 180 pound lost

188
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,230
difference is it's what what's making

189
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,420
this possible I just I'm so excited I'm

190
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,900
so invigorated anyway I got to meet so

191
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,740

192
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,090

206
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,029

228
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,369
amazing experience it is but my I did

229
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,629
take a friend with me and my friend is

230
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,879

232
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,529
pounds that I've been adding it up and

233
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,059
that's how many pounds people have told

234
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,559
you they've lost because of you and

235
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:55,050
that's just the people you've met if

236
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,029
you're out there and you're doing the

237
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,830
work and you're losing weight or you're

238
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,509
fighting your anxiety or you're fighting

239
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,339
the depression I get no credit for that

240
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,860
and I take no credit for that you are

241
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,740
doing the work okay

242
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,119
to know that I can be even just a small

243
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,709
part of it even if I just keep you

244
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,800
company while you're doing that means

245
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,259
the world to me it really does it really

246
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,080
does you know but but I this don't give

247
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,419
me credit all I do is make stupid goofy

248
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,949
videos all I do is share my life with

249
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,249
you if you find that as a motivational

250
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,499
to not make the same stupid mistakes

251
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,430
I've made then I'll take that shred of

252
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,319
credit but that's it that's it you're

253
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,969
doing the work you're the one killing it

254
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,560
you're the one you know if I met you at

255
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,969
e3 you're the one who packed it up and

256
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,889
flew across the country or drove across

257
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,279
the state to brave the crowds to spend

258
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,889
the money to deal with your anxiety

259
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:49,319
depression and whatever that

260
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,630
life is thrown at you you're an

261
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,850
inspiration to me man and I don't know

262
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,270
if you can

263
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,410
really understand I know if you can

264
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,610
really understand them when I meet fans

265
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,490
at VidCon or upcoming r-tx from e3 or

266
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,870
any of this stuff when I meet you guys

267
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,660
that's what keeps me going I told

268
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,700
several people this video until several

269
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,560
people this story I think I recorded in

270
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,330
a video once before my very first VidCon

271
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,370
I was ready to quit YouTube so much

272
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,200
negativity and I was reading the

273
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,970
negative comments I've always been a

274
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,260
person that reads the negative comments

275
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,670
it takes into heart really hurts

276
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,670
sometimes I don't really read them very

277
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,440
much anymore I'm kind of immune to it

278
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,560
now but then I thought I was getting was

279
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,610
negative comments I would get positive

280
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,950
comments but the negatives were so loud

281
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,560
but the very first VidCon I met so many

282
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,600
of you you shook my hands he told me

283
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,860
that what I was doing was making an

284
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,840
impact that it was valuable to you that

285
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,340
it meant something to you and maybe made

286
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,990
you laugh maybe it made you feel a

287
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,460
little bit better maybe it made you want

288
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,800
to try to work harder in life or maybe

289
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,450
just not make the same stupid mistakes I

290
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,050
had made and from that moment forward I

291
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,140
was just so excited just so excited to

292
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,580
come back home and work and every time I

293
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,080
go to these events it recharges the

294
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,540
batteries I'm going to so many this here

295
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,970
it's very motivational keeps me eating

296
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,530
right it keeps me moving it keeps me

297
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,090
excited to move it keeps me excited for

298
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,130
progress because I know I'm gonna get to

299
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,700
me more and more of you the better I do

300
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,010
and that's the best feeling in the world

301
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,800
so that said I'm going to try to work a

302
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,820
little bit more I'm gonna try to

303

305
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
