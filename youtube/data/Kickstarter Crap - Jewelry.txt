1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,100
we're finally back with some classic

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,060
idubbbz content kickstarter crap I was

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,710
considering not continuing this series

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,290
because I'm not exactly the same

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,870
relatable happy guy looking ass that I

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,250
used to be that you this order the

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,190
trashcan idubbbz who would pull empty

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,750
energy drink cans out of the trashcan

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,020
and use it as a camera mount but I still

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,519
think it's good to make these videos

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
because it gives me an opportunity to

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,070
say the same message I was saying back

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,199
then which is live within your means and

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,719
don't waste your money on stupid shit

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,430
today we're be using the keyword

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,370
technique where I select a keyword out

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,390
of a list of very hot topics and we look

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,070
at all the projects that correspond with

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:53,760
it jewelry jury what I'm thinking we're

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,460
going to find is a lot of girls who

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,350
don't know how to sew don't know how to

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,030
draw and don't know how to prostitute

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,160
who who've gone in their backyard found

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,229
a rock polished it up and crimped a bit

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,210
of metal around it and they're calling

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,250
that jewelry and trying to sell it for

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,320
an affordable price

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,590
Genevieve's jewelry design a $500 gulf

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,270
so really shooting for the stars on this

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,450
one why wear plastic and franken metals

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,070
when you can have beautiful sterling

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,130
silver and semi-precious gemstones for

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,650
the same price well I'll tell you why

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,960
because all this shit looks the same

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,939
that's why you guys don't know this

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,100
about me but I'm big in a jewelry I've

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,030
always loved it

38
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,280
I think I have a keen eye for it I know

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,590
what looks good on a human body so when

40
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,180
I see a Kickstarter project like this

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,159
that claims to make things that are

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,680
sterling silver and gemstones I see

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,060
right through it because when I look at

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,890
this picture I don't see sterling silver

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,380
and gemstones I see colored plastic and

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,049
a bit of fucking pot metal okay so don't

47
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,100
give me this shit

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,880

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,080
join together as we celebrate Lakers new

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,480
era we looked in a Laker marketplace and

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,860
found there's no lint Laker jewelry

67
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,600
except the Laker jewelry they had Laker

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,820
logo on it but Laker logo don't look no

69
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,070
good so we like to use Laker color cuz

70
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,200
Laker color cool go purple purple gold

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,880
let Laker color purple cold cold cold

72
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,420
cool very cool color hey first lei it's

73
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,400
kind of sad to see Kickstarter projects

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,290
trying to piggyback off the success of

75
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,239
an already established brand and they

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,040
have to do it very like roundabout ways

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,110
in this case is very obvious like

78
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,060
basically Lakers inspired they used

79
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,830
terms like that a lot and if someone was

80
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,959
making some fucking Pokemon ripoff

81
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,060
they'd be like I'm using red and whites

82
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,310
to symbolize a pokeball but it's a

83
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,720
bracelet so it's not affiliated with

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,730
Pokemon at all the crowning jewels

85
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,220

[Music]

172
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,430
how to be a faggot 101 to get out your

173
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,170
notebooks kids cuz you're about to get

174
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,030
some knowledge let's take away the crumb

175
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,680
and his beard let's see if that helps

176
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,540
okay he still looks gay okay I don't

177
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,130
know what to do he's lost cause this

178
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,040
slideshow of Liam Neeson's gay son is

179
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,020
brought to you by recording it really

180
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,210
shit frame rates and then try and do a

181
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,950
slow-mo effect after it's way too

182
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,230
fucking late well it looks like the 3d

183
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,000
models are completely fucked up as well

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,010
so there goes my theory is this the new

185
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,980
tough guy mustache oil wears an Amish

186
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,100
hat and has beard jewelry not to mention

187
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,560
his little fucking cheekbone piercing I

188
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,300
feel repulsed I knew I was in love the

189
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,790
moment he looked at me the first thing I

190
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,400
saw was that incredible reverse bindi

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,430
that's what I knew that this was the

192
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,870
Frank and stunning for me

193
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,210
he had the hair of a man the hair of a

194
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,790
woman big fuckin holes in his ears

195
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,860
objectively it's actually pretty good I

196
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,020
mean when you compare it to punching

197
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,400
holes in your ears and putting little

198
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,350
gems in there you just corkscrew some

199
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,700
cancer into your beard and you're good

200
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,890
to go I mean I think that the guy's

201
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,510
could even take it a step further and

202
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,030
have some like semi-permanent placements

203
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,200
in their beer girls are always like

204
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,120
shaving the shit off and like drawn on

205
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,790
eyebrows gluing on eyelash extensions

206
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,470
and all this sort of shit hey guys why

207
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,970
don't you why don't you glue some little

208
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,479
beads

209
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,490
little little tokens and pendants in

210
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,140
your beards and then guys you can go

211
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,060
into your local barber shop and and ask

212
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,910
your barber hey I've had these gems in

213
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,380
your a while and I was I was thinking

214
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,150
about having him replace I'm not sure

215
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,490
how many how much is this gonna cost do

216
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,380
you think I should get beads you think

217
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,880
I'll they'd be cute if I spelled out my

218
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,190
name and my beard yeah do you have cubic

219
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,660
zirconia maybe I could put a little few

220
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,330
of those in there oh that's cheap

221
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,400
research shows that both men and women

222
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,380
from various cultures agree that bearded

223
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,630
men appear more mature powerful

224
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,720
attractive and higher social status than

225
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,240
clean-shaven men oh I didn't realize

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,490
we're gonna do the roast of idubbbz TV

227
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,520
in this video yeah my penis is small -

228
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,950
you know mention that you guys are the

229
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,930
ones one and make beards gay

230
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,880
talking about putting a gym and a beard

231
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,240
it basically costs $30 for one jewelry

232
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,850
to put in your beard which I don't know

233
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,589
if that's a good price or not I think

234
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:33,540
I'd be satisfied with gluing a cheerio

235
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,370
to my soul patch and just rolling around

236
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,890
town with that your beard deserves the

237
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,350
best of Italian design that's the

238
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,459

the suits custom you jewelry's custom

240
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,500

241
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,420
get Ian lucky it's been a while since I

seven thousand seven hundred dollars
