1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,969
50 seconds of logos may 17th 2009

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,190
narration according to legend

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,800
himeko the first queen of Japan was a

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
powerful sorceress who ruled her Empire

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,390
through dark magic problem was starting

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,010
off your movie with research heavy note

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,539
backstory narration as I feel I've

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,010
walked into a college lecture instead of

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,349
a movie theater entombed beneath the

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:29,970
mountains they find out later she

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,380
actually buried herself to save the

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
world but I wish someone would bury the

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,710
ancient culture berries evil cliche a la

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,660
parallax so that 5000 years from now

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,219
they can ironically annoy audiences

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,690
again when a distant relative of a

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,280
forgotten screenwriter accidentally digs

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,390
it up searching through the underwater

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,329
city of Los Angeles entombed beneath the

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:45,870
mountains

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,719
I found a speck on an old map that no

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
one else has why the these things always

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,960
have to be in the mountains

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,430
I can't the treasures ever be buried

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,629
beneath something more exciting and

26
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,640
unique like a brothel in Texas if one

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,870
could come up with a logical reason for

28
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,890
there being the best little whorehouse

29
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,780
treasure hunt in Texas I think people

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,030
would be down also aspect what does that

31
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,010
even mean other people have the same map

32
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,470
but mine has dirt on it egad I'm Way

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,909
ahead of everyone else on finding the

34
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,530
mystical ruler buried with a mythical

35
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,140
death touch I have to get that fast so I

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,790
can write the word first on her tomb

37
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,250
before some other noob does Million

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,060
Dollar Baby to the Laura crop inning

39
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,009
this is just sparring right so they

40
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,570
could stop this at any time no need for

41
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,130
Laura to almost run out of air or to tap

42
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,259
out just stop inviting the director said

43
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,610
let's have your character hold an apple

44
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,630
with her mouth while tying our shoes

45
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,250
it'll make her look like even more of an

46
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,549
asshole

47
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,320
if this delivery outfit means we're in

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,000
the premium rush expanded universe this

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,680
is already the greatest video game movie

50
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,119
ever made what are you two plotting

51
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,979
we're gonna do a fox Huntress it's gonna

52
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,210
happen it's in and we're about to deal

53
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,619
with this really uninteresting bike race

54
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,509
which makes me wonder there will be two

55
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,680
ray turing at some point in this Tomb

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,060
Raider movie right that's a lot of

57
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,710
people here for this fox hunt is a silly

58
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,270
game a national pastime I got at least

59
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,070
30 people out to play hardcore bike tag

60
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,479
and I can't even scrounge up five

61
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,420
friends for a monthly poker night

62
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,620
is five seconds even enough for a head

63
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,940
start to make this chase payer and

64
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,470
surviving the game they at least gave

65
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,090
ice-t the time it takes to eat a nice

66
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,190
leisurely breakfast wait a second

67
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,720
they're crafty crafty that can't be

68
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,100
legal Kanna if the movie would offer

69
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,570
some rules maybe we would know if

70
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,040
fantastic mrs. Fox here was actually

71
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,690
clever just a cheater cheater apple

72
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,940
eater and if it was legal why is she

73
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,440
getting back off you had this thing won

74
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,730
I'm sorry I'm just something kind of

75
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,180
Krofft

76
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,920
if a central story element to this film

77
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,990
is Lara not being sad long enough to

78
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,790
sign a paper that Nets her insane wealth

79
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,080
and this movie might as well be called

80
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,060
Tomb Raider firstworldproblems you got a

81
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,830
sign in like everyone else what's your

82
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,250
name

83
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,790
Lara Croft will be rebels in the I'm

84
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,900
more important than you thought ro

85
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,550
actually my sister married a guy with a

86
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,050
last name Wyndham and every time they

87
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,640
checked into a Wyndham Hotel this exact

88
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,200
same thing happens in other news I'm

89
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,459
thinking about changing my last name to

90
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,070
check the lake technically speaking you

91
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,110
meant to sign the papers first

92
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,180
yes but plot conveniently speaking she

93
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,320
didn't how do you write with such

94
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,519
beautiful writing and then completely

95
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,500
missed on dotting the ice the one final

96
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,820
is two letters off from the one for

97
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,290
first completely missed the entire word

98
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,350
geez Croft calling your titles my final

99
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,030
destination the first

100
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,200
technically the L would be the first

101
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,760
letter on the tombstone so why don't you

102
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,590
go for the R that was the clue also I

103
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
love a good posthumous puzzle as much as

104
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,620
the next guy but this one seems risky

105
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,930
sure Laura found the key but all someone

106
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,220
has to do is accidentally bump into this

107
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,570
grave and reveal there's a lock there

108
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,370
this room seems awfully dust-free for

109
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,959
not being open for seven years and

110
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,430
there's not a single light bulb that's

111
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,489
out even turned off for seven years that

112
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,840
camera would be dead as a doornail

113
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,299
unfortunately if you're watching this

114
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,329
tape then it means that I must be dead

115
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,769
if you're watching this tape that means

116
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,239
I'm dead please shit when your mother

117
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,090
dies grief nearly destroyed me I began

118
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,910
searching the world desperate for the

119
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,130
hint of another realm and even though I

120
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,290
clearly loved you and himiko was simply

121
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,549
a chick who touched people and killed

122
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,780
them I felt that was good enough to

123
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,329
abandon you for I need you to burn all

124
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,610
my research on the him eco project if it

125
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,870
was that important why didn't Richard

126
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,459
just burn it before he left he clearly

127
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,660
didn't need to take it with him have a

128
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,310
look obviously we know the amulet here

129
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,750
is worth something but how does this

130
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,310
woman know so quickly and without even

131
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,780
closely inspecting it it's

132
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,880
nice and casual can we invite Nick Frost

133
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,230
to the next poker night because

134
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,760
verbalizing your bluff cover ups is

135
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
about us telling a toe that has never

136
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,669
tell 10 please it's a tad bit more you

137
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:26,720
know how you could get a tad bit more

138
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,760
alarm you could go sign a paper that

139
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,320
gets you what I can only assume as many

140
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,320
millions for just such occasions just

141
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,240
such occasion except on this occasion

142
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
the coffee was clearly already within

143
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,600
reach without using the pen so I use it

144
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,850
at all elements over that guy robbing

145
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,200
Laura helpfully gives the name of the

146
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
boat she needs to find to continue the

147
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,790
adventure before robbing her Tomb Raider

148
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,810
of the Caribbean endurance isn't that

149
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,520
the exact boat she was looking for well

150
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,870
would you look at that I guess good

151
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,190
things do happen to lucky people in

152
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,300
movies where the plot needs to keep

153
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
moving for they just don't care anymore

154
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,410
okay movie pro tip you can often judge

155
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,940
the movie nasaw of any movie by the

156
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,560
proximity of any given character to a

157
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,300
picture of important people to them at

158
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,770
the exact moment it would be most

159
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,180
emotionally necessary for them to see it

160
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,210
June 23rd I may have found the next

161
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,770
piece to the puzzle I was willing to

162
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,270
forgive the first two rounds of tapes

163
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,919
position but you had to go to the well

164
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,510
one more time didn't you this is turning

165
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,310
into diary reading the movie that within

166
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,250
the tomb one must face the ordeals of

167
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,440
Himiko is the first one only the

168
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,720
penitent man shall pass because I might

169
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,830
be able to help you out if it is I'm

170
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,450
convinced that my progress is being

171
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,789
monitored I know them by name now the

172
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:39,650
order of Trinity they were known by

173
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,120
another name the Brotherhood of the

174
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
cruciform sword you know what this movie

175
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,510
is so unapologetically ripping off the

176
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,630
Last Crusade Hindman add 10 cents for it

177
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,650
how is that not the first thing they

178
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,620
went for not sure I can speak to how

179
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,630
good of a captain Lu Ren is or isn't but

180
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm confident in saying that neither he

181
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,930
nor Laura are very good at abandoning

182
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,940
ship overdramatic much moving Jesus

183
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,530
she's literally just jumping into water

184
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,240
which the viewer had no doubt she will

185
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
make it into it the way this is shot and

186
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,030
scored what heavy think she's trying to

187
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,380
land on something very specific while

188
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,030
rescuing a newborn baby from a lion's

189
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,000
mouth hello hey we're just the island

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,289
crew who stands here in the middle of

191
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,850
the storm of the century in case someone

192
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,380
randomly washes ashore that we can

193
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,030
conquer over the head we'd love to comp

194
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,740
I asked Jerry here if we could be called

195
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,640
the Concord crew

196
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,760
he said no Jerry Arif

197
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,740
you hit it thank God I found you if I've

198
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,820
learned anything for movies over the

199
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,380
past couple of years it's that if Boyd

200
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,240
Crowder finds you it's most definitely

201
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,950
not a good thing I have two daughters

202
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,100
dark hair like you pretty thank you

203
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,320
forgive me rude does every dad abandoned

204
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
their daughter and go off seeking

205
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,140
treasure in this universe also don't get

206
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,240
me wrong I'm 100% here for the Gaga

207
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,280
designs but he's so typecast by this

208
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,390
point that he might as well legally

209
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,980
change his middle name to Toral's

210
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,020
mustache are you an evil occupying force

211
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,670
in a Hollywood production but can't be

212
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,990
sure if the audience actually knows how

213
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,060
evil you are now thanks to the miracle

214
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,400
of slave labor you can force slave labor

215
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,050
removes all doubt from audiences of all

216
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,940
kinds that you are truly the dirtiest

217
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,440
bastard in the movie and audiences

218
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,150
everywhere will rejoice in your eventual

219
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,420
demise

220
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,860
they've been here close to seven years

221
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,330
huh they not come across this before

222
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,710
what exactly does having their hands

223
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,210
tied up accomplish at this point all it

224
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,590
does is impede their ability to work

225
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,300
mattias as crew have guns on them and no

226
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,620
one else has their hands tied we know

227
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,180
Mattias is not going to shoot Laura so

228
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,680
the scene holds about as much dramatic

229
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,150
weight as an episode of Modern Family

230
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,410
all right hey go how much harder would

231
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,880
it have been to actually add the words

232
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,890
to run after get ready two syllables

233
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,330
away from Laura at least having a clue

234
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,800
what you were thinking also how does he

235
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,330
think taking out one guard would give

236
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,740
Laura the ability to escape it's not

237
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,270
like he's the only guy around with a gun

238
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,860
this guy doesn't miss this guy's gun

239
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,510
doesn't jam and this magical pulley

240
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,160
thing doesn't take this guy out Laura

241
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,750
dies before ever getting to raid her

242
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,490
first - Jesus these guys are terrible

243
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,290
shots Trinity clearly didn't go with the

244
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,430
a crew for Project Henoko oh no what

245
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,020
will she do she's got nowhere to go

246
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,580
except for that lucky ass tree bridge

247
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,960
that's crossing the ravine and just

248
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,220
happens to be at this very spot where

249
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,520
she ran yeah just get those last couple

250
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,320
of pointless shots off maybe Matthias

251
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,940
will give you a gold star for the effort

252
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,160
later this is a sure deadly ass drop off

253
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,570
this waterfall if not for yet another

254
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,190
lucky ass thing that's going to save

255
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,660
Laura that probably shouldn't even be

256
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,430
here considering how deteriorated it is

257
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,710
Jesus it's like the island knew what the

258
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,910
plot of this movie was gonna be before

259
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,860
Laura got here after all that craziness

260
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,030
with the plane moving around

261
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,500
it's amazing that not only did this

262
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,510
parachute end up directly above her but

263
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,010
with the logo face out so we could all

264
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,480
know what it was the entire plane

265
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,010
sequence is awesome and there's a great

266
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,510
action centerpiece for this film however

267
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,550
I'm not saying she would necessarily die

268
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,260
after all this but I am saying she would

269
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,640
definitely be dead in a tomb raider

270
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,290
movie that has legitimately good action

271
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,610
and fighting sequences this pitch-black

272
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,440
fight scene where it's impossible to

273
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,849
make out what's going on seems really

274
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,420
out of place

275
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,740
hey it's Richard

276
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,599
Frye said no one wanting this movie also

277
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,099
however Richard and Matthias not run

278
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,870
into each other this entire time Oh big

279
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,010
as this island just ignored in the

280
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,930
Battle of 2018 scenes involving a father

281
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,580
thinking his daughter who he hasn't seen

282
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,230
in years is a hallucination Tomb Raider

283
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,120
beats a wrinkle in time by a mile but

284
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,560
you still made me think about a wrinkle

285
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,149
in time and that movie heart if he

286
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,680
thinks she's a hallucination why would

287
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,910
this gesture make a difference it's not

288
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,620
as if his mind couldn't made that up -

289
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,720
he's not going anywhere

290
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,220
- bad this wasn't your answer seven

291
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,750
years ago a lot of this could have been

292
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,640
avoided but I realized she never let me

293
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
leave lorrison this one what are you

294
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,350
talking about who's she what part of

295
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,089
burn all my papers did you not

296
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,920
understand I mean I'll give the guy a

297
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,630
bit of a pass since he's been cooped up

298
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,279
in this cave for almost seven years but

299
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,690
considering she found the island at all

300
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,430
how did you not already realize she had

301
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,750
the research with her militia vikander

302
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,310
apparently went to the Tom Cruise school

303
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,990
of running toward things what a modern

304
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,339
action heroine seemed to be drawn to

305
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,320
using a bow and arrow Lara Croft Katniss

306
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,740
Everdeen

307
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,870
Legolas no one will be seated during the

308
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,399
people exchanging ineffective gunfire

309
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,810
portion of the movie and we shall run

310
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,040
known that you were alive all these

311
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,899
years maybe take a walk every now and

312
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,550
then seriously the silent can't be that

313
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,350
big I have to come home this fantasy

314
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,079
time I'll do it honestly the only thing

315
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,700
surprising about this decision is that

316
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,079
it took so long for Lara to make it if

317
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,070
you don't believe in the supernatural

318
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,779
what's the fear and opening the door a

319
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,220
sneezing fit later we're gonna find out

320
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,480
that him ago buried herself in the

321
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,550
mountains to save the world so why did

322
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,079
she leave a puzzle to solve to get back

323
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,730
in why would they want anyone to find

324
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,020
this scene if they made a Dark Souls

325
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,760
heart this is not a drill Babel 80

326
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,110
freakin minutes into the movie and we

327
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,520
have officially started reading a tomb

328
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,740
all hands on deck it's go time kids a

329
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,290
ratna CJIs should have seen the look on

330
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,300
your Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

331
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,510
with 37% more spear induced vasectomies

332
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,459
I wasn't designed to keep people out I

333
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,860
was put there to keep people in and how

334
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,720
exactly did you deduce that because from

335
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,829
where I'm sitting it just looks like it

336
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,660
was designed to shish kebob anyone who

337
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,089
steps foot on it great

338
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,790
survive the phases of Hamaker we're

339
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,569
getting closer

340
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,709
Thanks McNulty oh not even five minutes

341
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,540
ago your buddy got anal speared after

342
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,009
someone stepped on a stone trigger and

343
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,300
you're still stomping around willy-nilly

344
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,110
in this too

345
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,579
whatever is about to happen you kind of

346
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,600
deserve it man how do you know it's not

347
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,829
an ancient glory hole

348
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:55,209
seriously Loren if you get hit in the

349
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:57,009
head with a dusty cobweb a mummy penis

350
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,769
that's on you progress sure that prayer

351
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:00,220
wheels

352
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,930
I believe that Richard is aware of all

353
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,360
the Japanese witch rituals this is a lot

354
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,709
to throw on an audience with less than

355
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,149
30 minutes left in your movie also I

356
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:07,899
have a question

357
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,040
since the floor is collapsing beneath

358
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,509
them while they look for the key to this

359
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:12,339
door I'm wondering if they fail does the

360
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,779
floor reconstruct itself for the next

361
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,399
people who want to stupidly raid this

362
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,259
tomb with the seal him ago behind these

363
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,639
walls forever which is what should have

364
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,110
happened in the first place the number

365
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,819
of tiles we've seen and heard falling

366
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:23,559
should equate to no more tiles for them

367
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,740
to be standing on anymore

368
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,959
I would removed a thousand sins if the

369
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,519
yellow key fell into the chasm and

370
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,079
everyone shrugged and said well you

371
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,459
can't win them all and the movie just

372
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,809
ended right then and there she was

373
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,999
protecting the world I still making it

374
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,379
possible to find her if you wanted to

375
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,870
unleash a plague on the world see

376
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,249
smoking there's so let me get this

377
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:45,730
straight

378
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,410
Queen death strike here sacrificed

379
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,360
herself so her people could live and for

380
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
some reason built a device in her coffin

381
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,779
just to prank a future Explorer with a

382
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,399
classic jump scare Japan she was to

383
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,559
carry out she was immune how do you

384
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,269
contain a disease that turns people into

385
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:02,889
walking death machines that fast

386
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,079
especially in ancient Japan seems like

387
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,759
Queen Himiko and her Titus touch would

388
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,199
have eliminated the entire population

389
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,519
before anyone knew what happened I just

390
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,429
need to take a very small piece of you I

391
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,480
realize we're probably saving this for a

392
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
big reveal or something but the fact

393
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,209
that our main bad guy is just a

394
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,040
workhorse for someone else with unknown

395
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,779
motives means we have no investment in

396
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,920
understanding why any of this is

397
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,870
important or why we might not want it to

398
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,069
happen bad guys don't need a ton of

399
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,870
backstory but they do need at least some

400
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,670
motive right convinced unspoken but

401
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,370
somehow understood plan now oh and they

402
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,079
turn into zombies because of course they

403
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:36,939
do I guess I should say Laura survives

404
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,620
this but it's clear that she's as

405
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,089
immortal as a minion after everything

406
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,709
that's happened to her prior so let's

407
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,449
just tack on 20 sins for all these

408
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,420
instances

409
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,770
archaeological Ninja Warrior I'm done

410
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,740
for I'm infected for how long though

411
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,720
because the first redshirt decompose

412
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,250
within seconds after his hand showed

413
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,260
symptoms the disease discriminate

414
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,700
between the bad guys and the long-lost

415
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,440
fathers who need one final to buy with

416
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,820
her daughter who should have just burned

417
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,470
everything in the first place and left

418
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,270
good enough alone watching Lara go back

419
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,710
through the collapsible floor room makes

420
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,880
you wonder how these assholes ever

421
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,020
thought they were going to bring him to

422
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,670
go back it's even crazier when you think

423
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,540
about how they would have had to get

424
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,160
back over this ladder at the chasm of

425
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,810
souls as well honestly this is a big

426
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,580
troll job by him ago because I don't

427
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,780
think anyone could have gotten her body

428
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,340
back outside once they went through her

429
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,680
ordeals you're not saving anyone

430
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,810
oh right Trinity because that's

431
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,830
something I'm supposed to care about

432
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,300
apparently even though I know as much

433
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,920
about them as I do the Bolshoi Ballet

434
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,500
you know jeez Laura drama queen much

435
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,210
that's athletic as she has proven to be

436
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,830
why doesn't she just make a run for it

437
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,060
and try to kick it off from the other

438
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,500
side before he's up man Richard is

439
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,730
giving his daughter a very short

440
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,380
timeframe to take down Matthias and get

441
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,110
the hell out of there nope if the rocks

442
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,460
above are collapsing and what does this

443
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,170
rope even hanging on to this isn't like

444
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,430
the scene where someone won't runs a

445
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,080
fireball as the building explodes this

446
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,130
is something where gravity should have a

447
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,840
say in what happens can someone help me

448
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
understand a reason why on the woman who

449
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,620
just said for dreams and business deals

450
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,900
I'm just that kind of Croft

451
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,460
he's now flipping through a detailed

452
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,680
list of company owned assets and luckily

453
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,630
for franchise prospect she finds the one

454
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,040
company in a sea of companies that

455
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,270
actually matter for the big reveal

456
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,430
oh good it's like Lara Croft is James

457
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,890
Bond now and Trinity is respecter maybe

458
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,020
even her syndicate question is why does

459
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,070
Tomb Raider need an all-encompassing

460
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,110
evil organization to drive the plots of

461
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,550
their movies which should be copious

462
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,500
amounts of tomb raiding the only person

463
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,960
that I get to talk to is on the other

464
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,850
end of this phone it's hilarious that

465
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,380
Richard figured out that this mystery

466
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
woman was behind the order of the

467
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,380
Trinity that a private investigator saw

468
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,700
her casually walking down the street one

469
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,900
day and couldn't get a picture of her

470
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,280
face so that Lara can have this

471
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,050
Kobayashi copy kept reveal at the end of

472
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,360
the movie so and it is apparently part

473
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,730
of Panta or Trinity or whatever the hell

474
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,810
the company that's been behind the

475
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,730
scenes this whole time and I'm not sure

476
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,860
I could even care a microscopic amount

477
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,630
of less the movie ended then it didn't

478
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,980
so they would get one more glimpse of

479
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,279
Nick Frost being wasted in the

480
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,489
mind you my child I've abandoned my

481
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,949
tiles here we walk through the garden

482
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:14,149
but they don't know that we know what

483
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,399
they're doing basically no one else has

484
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,989
a better idea it'll be an adventure

485
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,540
adventure don't save it

486
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,749
hey did I crave not news thing since

487
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,220
you've burned the rest of my research

488
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,089
you'll never find it about do you think

489
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,610
my son would be that stupid he would

490
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,269
bring my diary all the way back here

491
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:39,230
just a bit outside it's just a little

492
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,020
old lady

493
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,000
