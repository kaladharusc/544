*look at his eyes. They tell stories of the old Viking battles*

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,060
Joke's on you, I don't make any money!

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,240
cuz the videos get monite- demone- nah

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,260

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,440

aey

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,140
What up you poor people?

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,560
Check out my latest car that I bought!
(on this free image Brad cut into this green screen? nice)

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,080
That's right, pretty impressive, I know. What's that in the back?

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,760
*ding* Oh, that's my mansion, that you could never afford
(unless i download it haha yes)

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,680
That's right, I am so incredibly rich!

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,460
Just kidding! Haha! You fell for that old meme?
(no, who the heck would even fall for that)

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,540
This is a green screen. (but it's white. like u)

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,020
*double pewds*

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
You can do all kinds of things with these

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,800
Hey, look now, I'm... in uhm...

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
*pewds realizes where is he now in 3*

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
*pewds realizes where is he now in 2*

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,900
*pewds realizes where is he now in 1*

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm in India now...

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,440
(nice teleportation skills)

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,060
Just kidding

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,600
Hey, look. 
Now, I'm in Guatemala

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,780
Just kidding

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,480
*questions his life choices that led him to this moment*

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,340
This green screen is from Elgato.

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm gonna link them in the description

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,159
if you guys want to check them out. This thing is genius!

32
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,940
If you ever had a green screen, it is the ugliest- it looks amazing on videos

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,560
Like it can really- it can really amp up the quality of your content and really put yourself out there

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,080
But if you ever use the green screen

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,180
it takes up your entire space, 
it looks ugly,

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,960
it's wonky as hell.

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,460
A lot of them are just cheap and bad

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,220
You need to light it properly

39
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,180
so you need to get all this lighting equipment

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,280
With this baby,

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,380
I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart.

42
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,100
I mean- never been some more genuine-

43
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,200
Never been more genuine about a promo

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,240
(welcome to hell army of 9 year olds)

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,220
This makes my life so much easier.

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,840
You know I- how I had that projector and the-

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,420
like before I had this giant bar on my ceiling and that was a

48
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,340
projector that I just painted green.

49
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,940
And I paid more for that than this Elgato thing

50
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,480
So yeah, if you make videos check out Elgato

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,800
Obviously, 
#Spons

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,100
But also very nice

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,060
&quot;Now move on with the video Felix, please.&quot;

54
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,260
&quot;Can you stop selling us things?&quot;

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,360
&quot;You literally just made fun of us for being poor.&quot;

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
You're right

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,900
Leave your memes in the comments below

YIAY

61
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,180
What MEMES did you submit this week?

62
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,280
Oh~

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,960
The real reason why Sweden lost last night

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,180
Posted five days ago

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,120
Sweden lost because Germany played well

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,380
Pff! No.

67
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,380
Sweden lost because they played badly

68
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,360
Pff!
No!

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,820
No, Sweden lost because they didn't worship Zlatan before the match

70
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,640
Pff!

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
NO

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,200
Sweden lost because Pewdiepie didn't include me- Bonus Meme in the latest  *trips over his words*

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,360
Bonus meme is dead.

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,440
Jesus Christ

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
Way to rub it in

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,360
Haha

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,100
Good Roasts

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,500

Upvote for Pewds to react to another country

84

HMmmm

85
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
I was gonna do a Swedish one, but

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,380
just so it doesn't seem like I'm just hating on all these countries

87
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,940
but there's nothing funny about Sweden they just-

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,220
It's just in jokes that are unfunny.

89
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,780
Thank you bus driver, very cool.

90

You know, say what you want about Trump

93

But at least

94
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,700
Upvote if you want Pewds to ACTUALLY show his YouTube analytics

116
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,680
(Just to suffer)

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
What the hell is that? It's like a hedgehog on my face

Last night, someone edited our Wikipedia page

135
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,540
to say he was our family. Showed security at our show,

136
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,500
got into the green room and had a beer with the boys

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,340
cuz the videos get monite- demone- nah

166
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,520
Upvo- NOooooOOO

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,280
Upvote- *bleep*

168
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,320
Accepting that the new EU regulations ban memes

169
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,980
Adding an overlay so the filter won't detect it

170
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,520
I mean literally-
me and Brad have been doing this for years

171
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,780
Whenever we have to use audio, we pitched it

172
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,360
so he doesn't get detected
 or we'll try and use it a little shorter

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,520
before it was like a 15-second thing.

174
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,920
This is literally it

175
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,640
This is how- what we're already living this meme.

176
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,140
This is not a meme. It's life 
(truer words have never been spoken)

177
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,960
*silent laugh*

178
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,220
Honestly

179
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,740
so *bleep*

180
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,020
(to himself) Can I stop swearing, please?

181
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,380
As- Dear Pewds *cue emotional piano track*

182
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,820
as a devoted fan base we can't help but notice

183
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,540
You've been acting very stressed in recent videos

184
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,260
I think I speak on behalf of the 9 year old army when I say,

185
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,180
Suck it up, you whiny little b-
*cue 9 year old army sound track*

186
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,480
No one gives an F about you and your... depression

187
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,140
*resume sad piano track*

188
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,460
I've never been more proud.
Finally

189
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,460
you guys understand

190
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,560
Finally, 
I have an audience...

191
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,740
that's not a bunch of little *bleep*

192
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Spend hours making these birds talk

193
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,940
*birds sings Blend S opening*

194
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,500
*cuts track*

195
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,240
SKRATTTA DU?!

196
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
FORLORAR DU!!

197
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,900
MANEN! (the Remix)

198
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Holy hell. The edit *genuinely impressed*

199
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,120
*pitched explosion*

200
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,280
Fake. Its fake. Okay

201
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
It's not cringey if it's fake.

202
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,420
Don't waste my time with this.

203
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,340
*snort-ish laugh*

204
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Damn

205
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,760
You're (got) some solid edits in here.

206
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,340
s(uh)m(a)j(a)135

207
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,480
A well done

208
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,300
Nihon-go, namaste. (Japanese language, hello)

209
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,180
Pewds,
They're still going have some mercy

210
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,740
The thing is the more this goes on,

211
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,240
the more inevitable it's going to be the fact that I'll have to eat hi-

212
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
*clap clap*

213
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,240
r/wooosh on Pewdiepie submissions

214
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,340
92% won't get this joke

215
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,700
Are you the nine percent?

216
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,240
Apparently Math isn't your strongest suit?

217
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,080
This is clearly a whooosh-ception

218
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,700
Like the bird said, 
&quot;I can't cringe if it's fake. Don't waste my time&quot;

219
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,690
Whoever's doing the caption is killing me

220
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,800
Realizes he couldn't come up with a joke in time because he's not creative

221
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,480
and that he gets all his comedic credit 
from his fans and editors.

222
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Hey,

223
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,820
you know- that is

224
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,220
So this is the EU flag. 
Yup

225
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,320
And you know, it's public domain
Yup

226
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,560
So making it a meme won't actually change anything

227
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,920
That makes sense

228
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,420
So stop making those memes

229
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,420
On July 5th, we must only upvote pictures of the 
EU flag

230
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,580
so they become a meme and

231
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,660
must ban themselves.
Upvote-

232
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,260
OH MY GOD! This is genius!

233
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,060
Finally, we'll fight fire with fire. 
*US national anthem plays*

234
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,340
There will be no banning on memes

235
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,040
on my command

236
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,020
That's right.
My- can we get some military audio?

237
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,260
My fellow 9 year olds,

238
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,140
On July 5th

239
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,040
We will strike them

240
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,060
at dawn.

241
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,440
We will fight them
 with their own weapons of machinery.

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,000
Copyri- copy strikes

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,100
That's right. Copy Strikes

244
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,140
EU flags. Blasted

245
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,740
Upvote this video

246
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,000
if you want another 
LWIAY
