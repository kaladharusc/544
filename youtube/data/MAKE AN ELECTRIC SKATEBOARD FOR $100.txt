amazing

56
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,239

57
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,319
advertisement

58
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,180

65
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,639
like a flying SUV I'm also just so

66
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,169
looking forward to getting away cuz like

67
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,120
I did that political video this week

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,310
which I stand by I'm glad I did it but

69
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,620
whole leaf people just went nuts in the

70
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,349
comments my god I'm voting for 1k if

71
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,970
you're not voting for the same person as

72
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,680
me I disagree with you but I'm not gonna

73
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,959
judge you as a Prasad no ill-will toward

74
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,000
you that's like I'm a human being

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,359
whatever but like Wow I expressed my

76
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,760
opinion and I'm passionate about it and

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,350
like the things people say

78
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,110
[Music]

79
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,210
been getting a lot of questions lately

80
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,330
about the annex this is the annex yeah

81
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,760
this is like an extension of my studio

82
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,530
it's a second studio it's just down the

83
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,210
hall from my studio and the idea with

84
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,130
this space is like I wanted to be able

85
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,350
to do more and produce more and expand

86
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,760
the different kinds of content and stuff

87
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,410
so I got this space I haven't updated

88
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,090
you in a while but it's here it's like

89
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,549
fully functioning now Olli right here

90
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,450
what's up Bali Ali's working on

91
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,250
production already doing back here has

92
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,660
been on logistics but he's slowly

93
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,060
shifting into production now and like

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,110
we're just doing kind of weird

95
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,510
experimental stuff in here all right but

96
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,460
some cool stuff is like there are no

97
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,230
windows here it's just a grocery shop

98
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,810
way so Dylan put these plants they're

99
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,400
fake but these plants there and then put

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
lights behind them so it almost gives

101
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,850
the illusion that there's both nature

102
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,190
and light outside there's no nature or

103
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,710
light outside and no the floor has not

104
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,510
collapsed yet I know that there was a

105
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,070
lot of concerns and I had a number of

106
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,110
architects and construction workers

107
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,490
emailing me telling me this is not

108
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,560
structurally sound it's good we're

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,240
strong up here the short of it though is

110
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,590
that the annex is serving its purpose

111
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:08,590
and serving it well for those that are

112
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,220
new here mailtime is a segment I used to

113
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,740
do like every week where people viewers

114
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,090
would send me like cool stuff that

115
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,010
they'd make or whatever I'd open it and

116
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,680
show it here on the blog but then I got

117
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,200
weird cuz companies started sending me

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
stuff just cuz they wanted me to open it

119
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,580
and promote it which felt like

120
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,720
transactional and I didn't like that but

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,790
I did like the free stuff so I felt

122
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,770
guilty and then I actually did work with

123
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,140
brands would pay me to lecture it just

124
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,919
got I haven't done in a while just about

125
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,450
the branded content stuff I always try

126
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,830
to be honest when I'm doing that and

127
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,280
upfront but you know that yesterday I

128
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,290
opened up this scooter here which I

129
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,880
couldn't figure out how to get it to

130
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,190
work but I called the people who sent it

131
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,690
to me they told me how to make so I want

132
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,220
to check out the electric scooter today

133
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,140
but something else showed up this

134
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,350
morning that's completely outrageous

135
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,870
unmark box here

136
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,900
and in this thing first there's a box

137
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,120
that says hope this cheers you up about

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,980
your lost drones yeah I lost a couple

139
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,980
drones this week please don't put this

140
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,740
letter in your vlog okay person will

141
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,360
remain nameless who sent this to me

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,220
I won't include your name but there's no

143
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,840
way you can send me something this good

144
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,730
and not expect me to talk about it dear

145
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,160
Casey I'm 18 years old this is my

146
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,810
attempt at creating a three-wheeled

147
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,300
electric skateboard in this box is a

148
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,460
homemade electric skateboard by an 18

149
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,990
year old kid here's where it gets funny

150
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,450
be careful I unknowingly bought a week

151
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,889
controller that has problems shutting

152
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,900
the circuit off while in motion that

153
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,330
means it will spontaneously go really

154
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,639
fast also I didn't buy a charging port

155
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,320
for this prototype so if you'd like to

156
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,970
charge it there's a positive cable in

157
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,139
the front of the skateboard behind the

158
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,680
disconnect unscrew the wire cut my god

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
alright he's here - looks like oh my god

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,169
always a thousand pounds if you can't

161
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:05,860
tell by this office or this vlog or any

162
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,500
I really appreciate when people make

163
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,539
things with their hands I was obsessed

164
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,070
with making things when I was a kid I am

165
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,390
still obsessed with making things look

166
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,860
at this ridiculous office that I worked

167
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,590
in but this is like this is next-level

168
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:25,810
man just empty plastic bag where's the

169
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:33,250
controller man

170
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,740
okay no big deal the operation is just

171
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,320
slightly different on this thing that it

172
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,940
is on the boost support there's just a

173
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,230
learning curve there I didn't mean to

174
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:49,100
get that

175
00:07:49,100 --> 00:08:02,400
we're getting used to

176
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,900
okay he mentioned in the letter that

177
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,820
this was a prototype just working out

178
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,390
the kinks so he does mention that it's a

179
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,970
week controller as in the signal sent

180
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,430
from the confession tape words right

181
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,810
here off on off on doesn't respond if

182
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,550
unless it's super super close and then

183
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:30,270
it's just uh okay okay

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,880
right

185
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,440
that on keeps it going

186
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,570
Express on okay you just is press off

187
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,110
and then just jump off and try not to

188
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,400
get hit by peer review and just keep in

189
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,720
mind this is an 18 year old kid and this

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,570
is a prototype my review great job

191
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,280
yeah that's as I first try definitely

192
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,060
the best wait wait you pump and then hit

193
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,250
the gas yeah so doesn't go unless it's

194
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,740
rolling dude you are a fraud on that

195
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,870
thing I'm just waiting for something to

196
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,400
go wrong thumbs up on the scooter gursky

197
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,260
this thing is smooth as butter

198
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:33,580
you gotta be moving

199
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,779

of fun it is dark out almost dark out on

205

my way home winter is here okay no big

206
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,610
deal the operation is just slightly

207
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,190
different on this thing that it is on

208
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,870
the Busan port there's just a learning

209
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,519
curve there I didn't mean to get that I

210
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,000
hope I didn't startle you
