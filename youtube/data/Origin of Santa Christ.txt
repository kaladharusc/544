1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,680
Oh was a long time ago longer now than

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,980
it seems in a place you probably saw in

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,710
a fever dream for the story you're about

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,650
to be told to place in the nyquil

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,859
induced comas evolve now you're probably

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,900
wondering where Santa Christ came from

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,170
if not I'd say well what's wrong with

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,180
you I mean doesn't this even strike it

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,500
was remotely weird

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,610
well don't worry it turns out I have an

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,130
origin story as well may not be as

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,829
interesting as say Iron Man or Stephen

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,559
Hawking but what the hell we have an old

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,120
time a narrator and a couple of bucks to

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,190
blow so here we go

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,960
Horn with the show a long time ago in a

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,399
galaxy far far away in the

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,110
not-too-distant future on a dark and

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,969
stormy night in the matrix well beyond

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,170
the town house I gave it a little

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,149
Kingdom called Egypt there was born a

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,050
very special child

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,359
his hair was his why the snow his beard

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,400
a softer Charmin his nose was as red as

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,140
a coconut wolf of wallstreet and his

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,150
cheeks as rosy as a Care Bears ass when

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,799
he laughed his belly shook like a bowl

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,630
full of coconut pudding and lo the

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,070
angels did sing on high and exclaim

30
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,560
foreign to us a Santa Christ is born and

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,450
many a sage and Shepherd a Magi offered

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,430
gifts of milk and cookies but all was

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,990
not well in the kingdom of Egypt for

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,369
Pharaoh her tales of this miraculous

35
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,140
birth and grew jealous of the child's

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,909
mighty beard and so was declared that

37
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,530
all children born with beards along with

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,880
in the Pharaoh shall be put to death by

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,530
electric razors Santa Christ mother

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,570
fearing for a child they afford to place

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,070
the babe in a reed basket on the banks

42
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,229
of long Nile there she set him free to

43
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,970
float down a path devoid of beard loving

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,680
tyrants away the reed basket went

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,210
falling through the deltas of the Nile

46
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,009
sailing through the tuna infested waters

47
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,720
of the Mediterranean past the Straits of

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,399
Gibraltar in unto the choppy seas of the

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,380
Atlantic long did the reed basket toss

50
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,030
and turn in the waves of the great sea

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,520
but no crying did Santa Christ make just

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,939
a gentle

53
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,369
ohoho in the middle of the Atlantic the

54
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,689
basket was picked up in the city of

55
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,939
Atlantis but the Atlanteans fearful that

56
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,200
they'd anger their guard threw the

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,219
basket back into the water

58
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,229
this in turn a Gerber guard in the city

59
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,450
was sunk after 40 days and 40 nights the

60
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,920
basket eventually washed up on the snowy

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,690
sheets of the North Pole there the child

62
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,250
was discovered by coca-cola drinking

63
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,100
polar bears who took pity on him and

64
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,020
taught him the ways of the bear bear he

65
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,850
learned to sled play with penguins ride

66
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,350
the icebergs and after it was all done

67
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,030
share refreshing iced cold coca-cola

68
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,980
with his fellow cops but it wasn't to

69
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,230
last for eventually his father Paul Kent

70
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,390
that's P aww in case you were wondering

71
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,890
kicked the coke bottle after succumbing

72
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,110
to adult onset diabetes from drinking

73
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,820
too much coke Santa Christ was

74
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,730
despondent Oh my sugary powers and I

75
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,230
couldn't save him

76
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,150
do not cry said his mother for your an

77
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,890
out of this world what do you mean

78
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,720
you're not a bear but what about my

79
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,610
white hair that's a beard and my love of

80
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,100
coke sugar addiction my fur that's

81
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,750
actually Uncle Frank's skin he tried to

82
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,250
eat you when you first arrived cuz he's

83
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,840
a bear and we sometimes eat our young

84
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,660
because we're bad so that burger meat

85
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,160
you've been feeding me enough questions

86
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,200
yeah we found this in your basket

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
it's a glowing peppermint rod we figured

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,440
when the time was right you'd know what

89
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,220
to do so I do Santa cry said but after

90
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,540
many months of beating other thing he

91
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,920
realized he had no clue what to do with

92
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,220
it so he tossed it into the frozen waste

93
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,230
and lo a mighty candy cane Castle rose

94
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,450
from the ice a fortress of sucrose awed

95
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,160
by its minty immensity since

96
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,900
christ-centered there he placed his

97
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,670
magic peppermint rod in a glowing mug of

98
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,770
charged hot chocolate and then a mighty

99
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,850
face appeared who are you I am Jehovah

100
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,120
one true gobloon yes and Who am I you

101
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,810
are my one true conception my son born

102
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,660
it to bring peace on earth and goodwill

103
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,910
to children and how do I do that

104
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,680
by fulfilling your destiny yes destiny

105
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,890
of half laid out before you where you

106
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,470
fulfill role a role which you are

107
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,330
destined to repeat again and again and

108
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,970
again and the sounds kind of redundant

109
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,500
trust me

110
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,200
you can make a great living and so was

111
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
that chief over the one Chuco bloom

112
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,380
instructed Santa Christ in the ways of

113
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,840
chaos acting rambling ranting talking in

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,340
circles placing your time laughs at

115
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,170
inappropriate intervals until at last

116
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,000
Santa Christ could disarm anyone with

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
his confusing charm and so his training

118
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,840
complete he received the candy cane

119
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,520
staff of peppermint power and was sent

120
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,680
out into the world

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
for three years he wanted to cross the

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,680
globe before geing many friendships with

123
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
powers great and small and his love of

124
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,650
pancakes grew

125
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,800
we're not spreading his word he saved

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,150
kittens and stuff I don't know there's

127
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,530
some pages missing if we try actually

128
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,090
reading the Bible Doctor Who is better

129
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,100
continuity but almost not well for the

130
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,480
Dark Lord Satan had gotten word that

131
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
there was a new player in town and he

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,230
was not to have known to where but he

133
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,490
had a plan to corrupt the children of

134
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,020
the world and it was video games

135
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,480
disguised as young tech-savvy CEO he

136
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
traveled from company to company

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,510
teaching them about updated graphics

138
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,400
faster processing technology an engaging

139
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,740
gameplay but they were all deceived for

140
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,690
deep in the bowels of Silicon Valley he

141
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,430
forged the counsel of his own and into

142
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,260
it he poured his malice his hatred and

143
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,910
his will to dominate all the children of

144
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,240
Earth the Philips CDI the master console

145
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,400
with this console children would be

146
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,350
fooled by snazzy full motion video web

147
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,450
browsing new Zelda games and online play

148
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,310
so much so that they'd sell their souls

149
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,229
for it which admittedly was far cheaper

150
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,450
than the $700 starting price I mean come

151
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,130
on that's like 1,100 bucks in today's

152
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,990
money one by one the children of the

153
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,240
earth fell to Satan's way and he left on

154
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,550
his throne of blood in Gary Indiana but

155
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,710
there were some who resisted sent Christ

156
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,180
d respect Cory the red horn or wall

157
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,010
caught wind of Satan's burn and flew to

158
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,810
sent Christ's secret hideout horrified

159
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,460
by what he heard he mounted his sled and

160
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,080
called out to his flying narwhals on

161
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
Campbell on Ramey on curly and Larry on

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,200
champey on Trumpy and don't forget

163
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,750
Marvin Harry using secret hyper Jets to

164
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,160
aid the tired narwhals through the

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
castle run they flew past the moons of

166
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,490

suggested a surprise attack on Pearl

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,910
mostly irrelevant mother Teresa

188
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,710
suggested helping the poor but that

189
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,120

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,500
their bottomless cups of coffee

194
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
exhausted and the syrup suppliers

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,830

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,690
with a plate of unfinished french toast

201
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,350
around a pitcher of coke and said this

202
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,770
is my Cola which I have given up for you

203
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,590

eat and drink of his brandy Cola and

205
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,130
then he said know that you are all

206
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,700

209
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,880
asked Wolverine yes actually and it was

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,370
a long and cup double silence hey you

211
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,919
asked but it doesn't matter we should

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,980
face Satan not with a sucker punch but

213
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,160
on a field of honorable combat and then

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,810
with a wrinkle of his nose and a wink of

215
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,360
his eye he smother 1985 bears running

216
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,660

219
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,060

220
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,110
wonder pass up a challenge

221
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,120
agreed to the bet should the league win

222
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,500
the CD I would be pulled from shelves

223
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,690
but should they lose the other consoles

224
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,310
will become Satan's forever and the

225
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,540
league would be forced to star in the

226
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,919
number of unsuccessful M night Shyamalan

227

233
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,979
difficult since they have fins but it

234
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,479
was no less difficult than for Godzilla

235
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,310
who had to ride himself making matters

236
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,810

they were known as the Hells Angels and

244
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,650
that was much scarier name than Santa

245
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,960
Christ team the snowflakes but who cares

246
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,100

the big rock candy mountain they fought

249
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,320
for the freedom of all earth the first

250
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,909

Hunter Steve Irwin accidentally scored

252
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,849
touchdown for the opposition three

253
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,349
timeouts wasted as team flag had to

254
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,400
explain the rules of American football

255
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,289

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,220
he'll yell but to play that is falling

263
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,990
apart like a flaccid penis Sacagawea

264
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,060
picks it up a touchdown flakes fourth

265
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,290
quarter near the end things were

266
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,730
desperate tie game at the two-minute

267
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,320
warning the lead substitute their secret

268
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,940
weapon Wolverine and he unleashed his

269

tornado claw but he missed in Santa Cruz

270
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,290
first our Father forgive me knows not

271
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,940
what he does and so it was that perhaps

272
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,010
he came to pass in Santa Christ fell and

273
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,000
there was a clap of lightning a

274
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,400
Wolverine screamed although three

275
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,660
seconds later Santa Christ worse can

276
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,160
have filmed up the awesomeness and then

277
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
Bears quarterback Jim McMahon snapped

278
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,190
his arm back but no Hitler forces a

279
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,750
fumble and he flies into the hands of

280
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,880
Alta Payton who shouts Hail Marys Santa

281
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,590
Christ and he throws the ball to the end

282
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,940
zone with Santa Christ is still rising

283
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,550
from the dead and lo skies opened up the

284
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,440
Sun did shine and the Angels rang out in

285
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,060
the glorious Alleluia as Santa Christ

286
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,440
caught the ball with the hairs of his

287
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,630
prehensile beard and yeah there was much

288
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,760
rejoicing for man and dinosaur the Bears

289
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,650

290
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,390
great console wars had ended as for the

291
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,070
CDI it disappeared into total obscurity

292
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,660
never to be heard from again

293
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,700
except in top-10 listless in YouTube

294

301
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,660
for his service in the cosmic Super Bowl

302
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,460
Santa Christ returned his precioso to

303
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,960
the waters of Loch Ness where the

304
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,250
monster retired and lived a happy life

305
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,530
photobombing Scottish Taurus but for

306
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,210
jolly st. Christ there was a certain

307
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,700
unease tired and despondent he returned

308
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,530
to his fortress of sucralose and spoke

309
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,470
with his Heavenly Father Jehovah I have

310
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,780
defeated Satan and yet my heart is

311
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,570
troubled for the kids now have no games

312
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,650
to turn to no consoles to play no

313
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,210
electronics to babysit their fragile

314
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,270
little box the answer was

315
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,000
for there was a alright his system which

316
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,140
fulfill all their needs something good

317
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:48,190
something pure not an end but beginning

318
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,800
Oh Gemma sense your instincts out

319
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,220
serving will my son go now give them the

320
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,430
power of 16-bits give them the speed of

321
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,600
7.2 megahertz CPU I changed the console

322
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,630
change the world and thus it came to

323
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,310
pass and every Christmas Eve Santa

324
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,900
Christ would ride with his nine narwhal

325
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,760
and pass out Sega Genesis to all the

326
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
young girls and boys said they were no

327
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,090
sooner forget what transpired long ago

328
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,800
when the world was consumed in the great

329
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,770
console war and if you listen closely on

330
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,780
a dark and starry night you might hear

331
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,460
him with a twinkle in his eye and a
