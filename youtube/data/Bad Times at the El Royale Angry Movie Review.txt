[Music]

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,770
hey guys angry Joe here and as you can

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,110
see we got a bit of a new setup I am

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,700
joined by other Joe and Alex and on the

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,439
other side of the table because I've

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,750
been told now that I have a tendency to

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,980
interrupt these guys when they're

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,710
talking rubbish never never happen ok it

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,930
does happen I will admit it but it was

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,210
on purpose in order to kind of keep the

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,670
movie review going keep it short and

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,159
also I have no eye contact with these

13
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,799
guys we're all staring forward it's very

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,830
kind of awkward feeling and so we wanted

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,540
to try a new setup where we're across

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,850
from each other right sure and this feel

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,920
more comfortable yes it's more a table

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,010
now yeah you can read this now I don't

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,040
have to be like what do i do what do I

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,080
do with my hands at the angry Joe movie

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,280
reviews and that's right segues into bad

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,580
times at the El Royale which is the film

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,910
we just got back from still still fresh

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,190
in our minds this is one of those kinds

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,050
of films that I think you know you

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,340
process a little bit it's artistic very

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,350
measured and intentional with its

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,770
visuals its storytelling it's basic and

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,410
and maybe the trailer has given away a

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,390
little too much the trailer was terrible

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,460
and I think that a lot of problems with

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,570
the trailer because I think this movie

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,640
was marketed incorrectly like Dell

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,140
thought this was a horror movie and

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,090
wasn't a horror movie at all and I don't

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,440
know where he got that idea but he saw

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,490
something that this is a horror movie

38
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,840
the first time I saw a trailer for this

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,490
is like I don't want to see this this is

40
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,470
gonna be all over the place it doesn't

41
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,909
look like it's gonna be a cohesive story

42
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,590
and it was just wrong I really like this

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,690
movie yeah and for me the trailer you

44
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,400
could see some of the spoilers it's like

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,530
well why ruin it I want to save movie

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,290
and be surprised but so we thought that

47
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,319
maybe there would be more twists in the

48
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,680
story unfortunately you know I'm not

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,450
gonna spoil anything there are some

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,490
turns and some twists and turns actually

51
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,890
so maybe they were holding they thought

52
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,720
we can show some of this because the

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,740
movie contains

54
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,100
you know a few more so this is a

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,830
collection of people they should have

56
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,780
renamed this film you know coincidence

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,750
the movie you know L coincidental or

58
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,280
something like that you know what I'm

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,590
saying because you have this really

60
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,240
interesting group of people come

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,700
together and shit starts going down the

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,070
film in the first act is quite slow in

63
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,150
fact and and I was I felt it was

64
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,960
meandering a bit maybe a little

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,510
self-indulgent with itself like I really

66
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,490
liked it you did like the pacing on this

67
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,740
so I like the pacing for the first

68
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,300
two-thirds and I know we you and I

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,620
disagree a little bit on this but I

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,330
think that they did a really good job

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,760
setting us up and this film is long it's

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,470
two hours and 20 minutes a little bit

73
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,360
longer than that and I wasn't bored at

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,920
all even in the beginning when they're

75
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,090
setting things up because they didn't

76
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,110
have scenes for the sake of having

77
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,660
scenes there was no we didn't learn a

78
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,340
bunch about the characters that we

79
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,840
didn't need to know like right like we

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,300
we got just enough insight into them

81
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,490
that was appropriate for the story so I

82
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,110
wasn't bored with it because there's so

83
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,910
many movies we see that the intros are

84
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,310
slow because we're learning stupid

85
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,150
things that don't matter

86
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,980
and that wasn't the case here do you

87
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,810
feel the same Jo oh yeah I felt like

88
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,280
everything was intentional and I really

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
like this way it was from the beginning

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,760
it reminded me of a crash yeah this is a

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,430
great yeah and I will say it's fantastic

92
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,720
performances that's perhaps why none of

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,580
these guys were bored and I wasn't bored

94
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,040
though the film is longer and it takes

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,290
its time setting it up it's characters

96
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,910
because you've got Jon Hamm you've got

97
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,330
Jeff Bridges Jeff Bridges it's actually

98
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,750
some of those heavy names right there

99
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,880
are good performances Chris Hemsworth

100
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,020
who is his he's doing his work it's a

101
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,840
little wiggle dancer if I had a body

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,880
like that that member memorize you yeah

103
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,830
you know I was couldn't take my eyes off

104
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,750
because like I want that you know what I

105
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,960
mean well Chris if I had that I'd be

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,310
doing that all day long

107
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,009
I don't ever come over

108
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,559
work on those I'd be like John working

109
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:44,029
from home what's the next thing alright

110
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:47,360
anyway so no great performances from

111
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,309
these actors and I gotta say I don't

112
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,889
know the actresses name but the singer

113
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,429
in this film Darlene is the character's

114
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,909
name voice is beautiful yep I really

115
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,949
liked her I kind of want to see a little

116
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,069
bit more on her which which is kind of

117
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,149
hard cuz like you have all these

118
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:07,069
characters there's like I think six

119
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:10,279
stories and it's so hard to kind of cut

120
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,869
it down to a movie but I want to see

121
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:16,669
more aspects of her and the maintenance

122
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,039
guy yeah you really enjoy everybody

123
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,240
stories because I think it's told

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,269
effectively it's it's kind of

125
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,069
artsy-fartsy a little bit it's like room

126
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,330
one room five room seven and you get the

127
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,719
backstory of the occupant of that room

128
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,449
how they're connected to the Ellroy yah

129
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,789
how they end up in the same place and

130
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:42,169
what an optin the past quite a bit of

131
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,749
the past yeah it wasn't so some of the

132
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:45,979
times like we've seen some movies were

133
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,869
they they do heavy flashbacks and it's

134
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,939
non-relevant garbage and there was

135
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,339
nothing here it was all flashbacks that

136
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,139
had directly to do with what was

137
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,930
happening during the 12 hours or 24

138
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,479
hours that happens at this film yeah so

139
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,800
this is one of those I guess you'd say

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,689
thrillers very intriguing film almost

141
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,939
whodunit kind of thing where the

142
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,759
audience is exploring the film and

143
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,529
learning new information about the

144
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,079
characters and how these plot lines will

145
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,659
then come together in the climax of the

146
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,610
film how did you guys think that the

147
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,740
difference individual storylines came

148
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,119
together I liked all but all but one of

149
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,099
them I loved and then the other one I

150
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,979
liked and it wasn't that well whose

151
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,899
storyline did you love and which one did

152
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,639
you like I liked all of them other than

153
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,569
the two girls yeah so the the whole

154
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,229
Chris Hemsworth line of like storyline

155
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:44,539
it wasn't my favorite it's one that was

156
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:45,979
kind of convenient and it allowed for

157
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,409
everything kind of come together and

158
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,269
just it didn't grab me like the other

159
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,029
ones did the the film has some some

160
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,009
shocking moments it's not action filled

161
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,679
but when something happens it's an

162
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,330
instant thing Joe were you shocked at

163
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,429
any time during the film oh yes I was

164
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,319
startled in one I don't want to ruin it

165
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,089
but yeah right right you can't talk

166
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:06,709
about it so I guess we'll talk a little

167
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:11,209
bit in spoilers but yeah so the subplots

168
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,219
did you think that all the subplots in

169
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:15,259
the film went somewhere was there

170
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,509
anything that you felt that was a little

171
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,089
bit of a plot hole or something crawled

172
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,099
to a halt because I can think of one

173
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,779
thing there were there are some things

174
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,149
that I if I remember we'll talk about in

175
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,559
spoilers a little bit it kind of seemed

176
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,139
a little out of character but only just

177
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,699
a smidge and that's only because we're

178
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,019
digging for it there was nothing that

179
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,419
was it was like no that doesn't make any

180
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,249
sense like most things in this film I

181
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,689
thought made sense did you like the

182
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,149
casino Joe or not Casino well I guess it

183
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:46,699
wasn't what do you like the hotel yes

184
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,610
but I still wanted to see some more more

185
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,479
of it I guess it was I'm not saying I

186
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,129
thought I thought that they would do a

187
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,499
little more with the whole California

188
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:59,839
State Line versa Nevada there's Liars

189
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,509
right but it's really just kind of this

190
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,229
this like a background drop that's right

191
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,409
exactly or a prop you know it's little

192
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,169
one-trick pony kind of thing and the

193
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,869
real story isn't the you know hotel it's

194
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,029
the characters within the hotel it has a

195
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,619
dark secret and then the secret spills

196
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:24,919
out amongst all of our interesting

197
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,409
characters that we are either invested

198
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:31,339
scared or intrigued by and and then we

199
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,199
see how these characters deal with it so

200
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:36,860
I think it's pretty fascinating and how

201
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,719
would you would you recommend this film

202
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,579
to you to your buddies Joe I would you

203
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,349
will definitely would it depends on what

204
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:42,889
your buddies

205
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,720
yeah I've got some buddies that want to

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,279
see you know Schwarzenegger blow some

207
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,959
stuff up and if that is your thing and

208
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,459
sometimes it's my thing this is not the

209
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,379
film for you this is it takes its time

210
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,089
it can be a little slow like you said

211
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,649
it's kind of artsy fartsy yeah but I

212
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,480
like that like I really enjoyed this and

213
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,319
there's gonna be people that I'm going

214
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,180
to like say go see this immediately and

215
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,100
other people it's like go see venom

216
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,600
again right

217
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,370
eight shots great visuals great

218
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,130
performances interesting story however

219
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,889
for me I think the payoff in the end and

220
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,610
that third act is not quite what I was

221
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,310
hoping for I was looking for a little

222
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,980
bit more impact in that that final act

223
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,529
and we could talk about it in spoilers

224
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,810
however I don't think that that makes it

225
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,389
a bad film I would still recommend you

226
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,339
go out and see that if you're willing to

227
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:29,870
and you know what you're getting into

228
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,240
with a film like this so let's go into

229
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,329
our final verdicts let's start with

230
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:38,029
other Joel this time all right I really

231
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,120
liked the beginning of this pacing like

232
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,130
I said I liked these kinds of individual

233
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,130
stories and the towards the end it did

234
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,810
lose me a bit we'll talk about it later

235
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,230
but throughout the thing I was a very

236
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,730
intrigued what was going on I was like I

237
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,310
really liked all the twists and I loved

238
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,040
the score - I like oldies so I really

239
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,480
like that - yeah I'm gonna give this an

240
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,810
8 Wow okay nice what about you Alex 8 I

241
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,759
think it was great there the only thing

242
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,720
that I wanted to give this a nine not a

243
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,730
like not quite attempt I wanted to give

244
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,610
this another way that this is a 10 I've

245
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,709
seen movies like this before where you

246
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,060
put all these characters together all

247
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,040
these interesting there you go that

248
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,199
would probably qualify yeah I definitely

249
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:21,500
agree

250
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,620
like I in the first the first half of

251
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,209
the film was like wow this could build

252
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,769
into something that's truly incredible

253
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:28,759
that's something I want to come back and

254
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,100
watch over and over and over it kind of

255
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,269
let me down a little bit towards the end

256
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,189
it's still a great movie

257
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,689
III definitely still think this is

258
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:38,660
innate ok I agree with these guys it's

259
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,220
an interesting film where interesting

260
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,259
characters come together at one point of

261
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,509
contention which hides secrets within

262
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,670
its own you know little things so kind

263
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,110
of think of like the hateful eight kind

264
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,250
of thing where people are coming

265
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,699
together in one location yet there are

266
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,529
flashbacks to other parts of the you

267
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,480
know country and filling in some of

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,370
these people's storylines however I

269
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,839
think the payoff could have been a

270
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,970
little bit better but I'm still thankful

271
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,610
that I watched it due mostly to the

272
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,209
actors I think maybe the singer girl may

273
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,430
be saying one too many songs like there

274
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,980
was one song where you know she's

275
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,199
drenched in in water or just went

276
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:16,279
through something she said

277
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,040
our hotel and I was like oh please no I

278
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,930
don't want to go through another song as

279
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,660
much as I love their voice as much as I

280
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,730
like that particular song it felt a

281
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,220
little forced to me for let's continue

282
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,949
to show off her best asset which I mean

283
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,540
it's a damn good asset to show up

284
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,819
because I will say her voice is heavenly

285
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,249
but I just felt it was a little forced

286
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,040
but then you realize what she's doing

287
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,680
she's using that voice of her yeah to

288
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,809
distract somebody and that's why

289
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,230
ultimately it didn't really bother me so

290
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,420
I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 as well

291
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,920
and I think that's all gonna be our

292
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,259
final verdict for uh my final verdict

293
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,439
Carell bad times at El Royale it could

294
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:58,850
have probably earned a nine maybe a

295
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,620
little bit better if the payoff was more

296
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,809
interesting and I think I would I would

297
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:06,499
like a little bit quicker pace because I

298
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,480
think in the middle it was started to

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,699
lose me for a little bit but then that

300
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:15,220
climax at the end it goes real fast a

301
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,079
final reveal is made about somebody's

302
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,170
backstory and and things go go into high

303
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,459
gear so yeah I enjoyed it so thank you

306
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,490
some some tweaks to be made and I think

307
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,160
I I could sometimes block Alex's face

308
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,620
with my hands and things like that or or

309
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,269

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,889
changes here we just talked a little bit

328
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,959
about what's going on so let's tackle

329
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,289
the characters one at a time well first

330
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:50,199
what's the secret of the El Royale Joe

331
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,659
the secret is there was some very

332
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,519
important person in that room doing

333
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,099
something he wasn't supposed to but he's

334
00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:00,279
also dead and the memory of him might be

335
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,289
tainted so they had this film of his 16

336
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,999
what do you mean a sex tape how was the

337
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:07,209
sex tape gotten how did Dave and well

338
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,449
the secret room you see here it's a spy

339
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:15,339
hotel the little windows and stuff and

340
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,089
okay so pervy hotel that everybody sees

341
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,369
all but it's purposeful so it's a spy

342
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:23,619
hotel like the the US government has

343
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:25,539
bugs in all the rooms but they're also

344
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,419
some other probably the Russians Soviets

345
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,549
have bugs in all the rooms we find that

346
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,919
actually bad Alex picking up on I

347
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,529
completely forgot about that you you

348
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,439
bring this huge because there were two

349
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,679
different types yeah of track so this is

350
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,949
in its in reno/tahoe border border of

351
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,779
California and so there's gambling there

352
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,119
it used to be you know big big place for

353
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,679
celebrities and both high rollers

354
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,259
important as politicians in particular

355
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,149
and so Hoover has the place bugged and

356
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,220
bad stuff is happening who do you think

357
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,129
they're talking about because the person

358
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,329
it's definitely one of the camp you

359
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,369
think it's John F Kennedy well it could

360
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:12,459
be it could be it's like and they kind

361
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,809
of throw some shade out of you know

362
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:15,999
somebody just talking who doesn't really

363
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,949
believe in it but ultimately just wants

364
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,439
to have sex I think at that point she

365
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,939
was just saying like she's heard it all

366
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:23,949
before she's she does not want to know

367
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,839
who's not actually she wasn't really

368
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,259
talking about that films okay that's the

369
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,699
only time they kind of throw shada at

370
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,229
that little science or any line but no

371
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:37,179
it was actually this cult leader so what

372
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,859
did you think of Chris Hemsworth is

373
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:42,279
wacky sort of cult leader comes in here

374
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,859
one of the girls who see these two girls

375
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,320
are Runaways the the younger ones

376
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,450
maybe killed her father or killed

377
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,030
somebody and this sort of religious cult

378
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,760
leader finds her on a beach charms her

379
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,600
and and takes her under her wing and her

380
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
sister runs away with her and their

381
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,170
that's why they're at the hotel they're

382
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,690
Runaways from this cult and she's also

383
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,910
she kidnaps her from like she's BOTS

384
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,820
she's had enough kool-aid that she's a

385
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,470
memoir and she's actually killed a bunch

386
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,170
of people and so the the younger sisters

387
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,850
one that drank all the kool-aid and then

388
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,800
the older sister sneaks into the cult

389
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,720
kidnaps or pulls her out and is gonna

390
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,780
try to like get her away from all that

391
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,280
but it doesn't quite work out

392
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,920
yes he's completely indoctrinated to the

393
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,050
point where she actually really doesn't

394
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,390
even care about her sister ever say

395
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,850
about anything you can't see she likes

396
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,800
it fucked up in the head I think I had

397
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,050
the crit the Chris a little plot line

398
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,510
should have been like a sub thing like I

399
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,010
wanted something more impactful at the

400
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,680
end when you say that you mean that the

401
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,110
ending of the film didn't revolve around

402
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,110
Chris right that's exactly so when I say

403
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,730
the payoff I was looking more for maybe

404
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,160
the management of the hotel or something

405
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,740
like that because this guy is is sending

406
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,780
these tapes and he gets calls from them

407
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,850
in order to do these things but that

408
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,110
wasn't what it was about it was about

409
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,030
these people coming into one place and

410
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,220
the climax is when the religious leader

411
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,620
shows up and he's acting crazy he's got

412
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,449
the gun and he's playing a roulette with

413
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,250
people's lives killing people left and

414
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,339
right and and then they just and then

415
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,980
they fight you know

416
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,630
turns out our priest is not a priest I

417
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,430
mean that was ruined in the trailer yeah

418
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,709
we knew that from way early on in the

419
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,170
film he's a bank robber and his brother

420
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,600
stashed cash Nick Offerman who's my

421
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,760
favorite there you go and and they stash

422
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,740
cash there and so he's there but his

423
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,680
mind is is given on him he's got to

424
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,810
mention he's been in jail for so long

425
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,730
he's an old man he poses as a father

426
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,800
because people kind of look away and he

427
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,450
could kind of hide amongst people and he

428
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,240
can't remember where the money is but as

429
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,640
the plot line goes forward and shit

430
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,670
starts going down he manages to find the

431
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,220
right room and splits it with the singer

432
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,890
now did you guys feel like what

433
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,870
did you really meet her would this guy

434
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,120
really I think it's because he was so

435
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,330
charmed by her her voice and and the

436
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,760
kind of person she is as a good person I

437
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,760
mean he was given you know his doctor

438
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,080
told me he's terminal like he does not

439
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,340
have very long he said that you'll

440
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,650
probably make it to your parole date

441
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,020
which is six months from now and he just

442
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,880
got out of jail so he probably didn't

443
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,890
have long to live he probably wanted a

444
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,480
little money to you know live out his

445
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,309
last days and then you know she seems

446
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,630
like a good person plus she had the

447
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:38,410
upper hand she had the gun Jon Hamm was

448
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,200
not in the film very much it was said I

449
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
liked him he's the slightly salesman of

450
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,660
the sales vacuums and she's like well

451
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,340
you look like he's talking to this thing

452
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,990
you look like you have a lot of friends

453
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,490
that might need a vacuum and she gives

454
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,740
him the dirty vacuum alone trying to be

455
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,570
sexist really he's a CIA and so he's

456
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,980
there to perhaps you know collect that

457
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,220
that's a little confusing get the film

458
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,919
was he trying to discover this place is

459
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,200
privately run and and then he's gonna

460
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,570
shut it down or learn more about it they

461
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,429
talked about is he in cahoots with the

462
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,490
place no he's not no but you know he

463
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,410
can't help himself they tell him do not

464
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,299
he also says you know I wished and

465
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,549
witnessed a kidnapping when I you know

466
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:30,820
figured out what's going on here and so

467
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,530
he he just can't help himself he goes

468
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,169
over in front which I like but which I

469
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,400
like though because like he was talking

470
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,290
his daughter before he's like so he's

471
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,580
like that's probably somebody's daughter

472
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,100
I need a help so that little thing kind

473
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,809
of ties to get a good guy cuz he was

474
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,669
specifically told do not help them

475
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:47,500
that's not what the mission is but he

476
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,450
can't help himself he's a good guy and

477
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,710
he gets it gets killed

478
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,559
murdered well so I'm not gloriously like

479
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,600
he's killed in the movies like we're

480
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,880
moving on now yeah we like that choice I

481
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,650
like that so actually you talk about the

482
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,390
two different like jump scares there

483
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,070
were two that got me him just getting

484
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,790
blown away

485
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,040
I was shocked as like were only like an

486
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,020
hour into the film like you just blew

487
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,470
away you know a big star yeah yeah the

488
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,690
other one oh and when he

489
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,039
the priest gets hit in the face with the

490
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,590
bottle anyways oh he's like he's gonna

491
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,929
drug this girl and she can't see it but

492
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,399
for whatever reason and he just turns

493
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,019
around and she quacks him in the face

494
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,909
initially I thought that maybe she hit

495
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,289
him in the in the face with a bottle for

496
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:28,120
a different reason when she hurriedly

497
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,610
runs outside and is doing something else

498
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,259
I was like oh she got her own agenda but

499
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,720
no she noticed that he was going to

500
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,490
eventually drug her and she's thinking

501
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,529
oh this guy's gonna fucking rape me he's

502
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,360
trying to act like a father a priest and

503
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,580
he's caught it you know coddling me and

504
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,049
thinking that you know he's gonna catch

505
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,399
me off guard oh fuck he's good boom

506
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:48,909
right but it was not bad at all what was

507
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,059
it he was the the the money was actually

508
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,740
buried in her room like under the

509
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,779
floorboards and so because his dementia

510
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,519
he didn't remember which room it was so

511
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,139
he booked the wrong room and so she

512
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,120
because she chose the one next to his he

513
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,190
wanted to drug her stash her somewhere

514
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,049
and then get the money right so he

515
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,450
needed to knock her out and put her out

516
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,070
of the way but now that she has the gun

517
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,789
she's got some leverage and okay so

518
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,080
that's pretty much all the characters

519
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,909
got the sister that we cover every ah

520
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:20,440
though maintenance man see I kind of

521
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,820
want to see more of his backstory like

522
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:28,330
how do once more of everything Joe wants

523
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,700
movies to be four hours long but that's

524
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,960
what it's a good movie I was like oh I'm

525
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,580
intrigued by these characters I want to

526
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,190
know more which is a good aspect but uh

527
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,440
the maintenance man I want like I said I

528
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,230
wanted to see how he tied into the ROI

529
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,320
how he came there I didn't like that we

530
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,539
learned about him so late in the film

531
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,480
that might be a cutscene Joe where he

532
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,019
ends up a broken war veteran who sniped

533
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,669
over all it got over a hundred and

534
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:57,820
twenty kills and and he is just you know

535
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,620
shell of a man and he'll start working

536
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,720
here yeah because he gets triggered I

537
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,399
hope that's in there he gets triggered

538
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,019
they're like hey help us kill that guy

539
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,850
there's a gun in front of you kill the

540
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,919
guy it's like no I've already killed two

541
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,240
men he's like how many is like a hundred

542
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,470
and something that's when it's watch

543
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,539
back shit ten minutes before the movie

544
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,299
ends we learned that this we care so

545
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:17,919
much in that third act but that that

546
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,360
character who you don't think is

547
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
important at all he's just kind of there

548
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,690
but he turns out to be almost the most

549
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,799
important character in the whole film

550
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,809
because he determines how the movie is

551
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,490
yes and we learned everything

552
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,980
about him at the end I didn't like that

553
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,050
there they needed something to close out

554
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,370
the film and they're like oh and by the

555
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,910
way this guy actually he's an action

556
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,470
hero all right great

557
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,809
cuz he does end up going on a shooting

558
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:43,420
spree he turns he turns in he turns it

559
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,760
on I noticed in his mannerisms other guy

560
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,800
but you know what I was intrigued enough

561
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,670
that I was into it

562
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,950
boom boom boom kills the cult leader

563
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,070
Chris Hemsworth is all you know Cara's

564
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,230
met bomb he's gone all of his little

565
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,660
fucking lackeys with guns and shit like

566
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,240
it militaristic just takes a which also

567
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,130
explains his drug problem that he had

568
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,470
yeah yeah and I knew what would exactly

569
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,080
so this is such good character develop

570
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,260
there are character arcs and so many

571
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,600
movies get character arcs wrong where

572
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,550
the character never develops I mean

573
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,500
we've watched many of them but every

574
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,540
single character name here develops in

575
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,640
some way well be yeah because we see

576
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,150
them

577
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,500
well what's kind of interesting is we

578
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,630
see all of these characters and then we

579
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,780
see the the flashbacks and we see them

580
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,820
develop from the flashback into where

581
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,650
we're at in the present and so it's it's

582
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,330
the characters didn't develop in the

583
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,920
movie because the movies takes place in

584
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,740
12 hours but what's nice is you see what

585
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,260
Jeff Bridges the priest looks like when

586
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,970
he's young and doesn't have dimension

587
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,530
what he's like in prison in another

588
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,059
flashback and we see him what it's like

589
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,710
in this movie so yeah they developed

590
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,470
quite quite well okay and so the climax

591
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,390
of the film and why you know going back

592
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,650
to that and they felt a little

593
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,870
disappointed because you guys felt like

594
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,490
maybe the religious leader shouldn't

595
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,960
have been the climax of the movie what

596
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,550
did you want the climax of the movie I

597
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,990
don't know what I wanted I mean like I

598
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,490
like the idea of finding more about

599
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,929
management cuz there's two levels of

600
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,970
surveillance in the hotel like the CIA

601
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,370
no think it's just a normal hotel and so

602
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,929
they bugged all the rooms they didn't

603
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,520
know that there's the you know the perv

604
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,290
windows and like the recordings they

605
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,400
didn't know about any of that stuff

606
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,530
because Jon Jon Hamm would have would

607
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,179
have known about it and so it would been

608
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,640
nice to see you know when he calls J

609
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,670
Edgar Hoover that like the CIA could

610
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,570
show up and there could be something

611
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,740
else yeah that sounds cool

612
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,570
but but and I think another good thing

613
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,300
is when they that you know what they did

614
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,360
ultimately was sent to the story on the

615
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,360
singer and the bank robber you know and

616
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,150
so do they win at the end yes they get

617
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,860
the cash

618
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,170
and they go there's she goes their

619
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,030
separate ways but assumingly at the end

620
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,690
he shows up nice he remembers it she's

621
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,610
got the performance the next day at 6

622
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,120
p.m.

623
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,710
though a lot of this stuff happens I

624
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,910
don't know how she still shows it's at a

625
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,650
later date he's healed up he does ok

626
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,410
yeah it's gotta be all right and you

627
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,910
know he's just watching her career and

628
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,860
you know he nods at her and she nods at

629
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,510
him by the way she destroyed the

630
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,760
evidence of John F Kennedy probably

631
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,670
fuckin I don't know Marilyn Monroe

632
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,160
Marilyn Monroe we assume it could have

633
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,840
just been it could have been Nixon yeah

634
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,140
no no no they said he's tarnishes all

635
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,270
right so and there were pictures I think

636
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,880
if you pay real close attention to who's

637
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,650
visited the hotel before so yeah I think

638
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,600
it is implied but she destroys that

639
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,760
evidence and just takes the money and

640
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,130
they're able to you know live their life

641
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,160
the the sister character we forgot to

642
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,920
mention her she ultimately stabs the

643
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,670
Milan hero

644
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,300
one final character the little girl you

645
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,100
know how does how does her plotline and

646
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,530
well she stabs the our military heroes

647
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:56,200
miles he saved everybody but he

648
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,240
essentially killed her God her leader

649
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,530
her you know man

650
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,400
so boy from birth stabs him and he's got

651
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,390
this plot line where he needs

652
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,130
forgiveness for all the people that he's

653
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,020
killed he's done so much bad stuff he's

654
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,120
been a part of this a creepy hotel and

655
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,210
filming people and even though he's not

656
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,190
a priest I feel so bad for that I

657
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,720
actually was feeling emotion I was like

658
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,820
all right well yeah because he has to

659
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,400
take care of the whole hotel by himself

660
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,360
yeah that was crazy yeah and he

661
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,680
describes some of the things he had to

662
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,570
do in the hotel and he described like in

663
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,310
my opinion one too many things like I

664
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,780
didn't need the whole dude who slept

665
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,940
with the wolf story like raping a wolf

666
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,610
yeah it was really it was weird it's

667
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,260
like we didn't need to hear this it was

668
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,280
like it was not sexual but it wasn't not

669
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
sexual what's going up but now you

670
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,340
didn't say like that he's way more

671
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,530
creepy than that yeah um yeah so I guess

672
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,560
you know other than Chris Hemsworth I

673
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,880
mean that that whole plotline

674
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,010
took over the whole film and it wasn't

675
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,720
really part of the movie in the first

676
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,640
like we got glimpses of it and the bit

677
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,010
like the first half but that became that

678
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,200
whole subplot took over the whole last

679
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,820
third of the movie that was the movie

680
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,220
the culmination in hand and him arriving

681
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,540
there after she called him on the phone

682
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,010
because she can't get enough of them

683
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,800
what did she do does anybody know she

684
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,030
was a runaway already no she killed her

685
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,220
family she killed that family in Malibu

686
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:28,360
oh yeah I got it now yeah all right guys

687
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,160

692
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,640
in there in middle of nowhere that you

693
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,560

695
