11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:10,840
runner here which is gotta be like eight

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,790

this is a fig the name of this episode

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,320
is I got a Learjet or something like

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
that I haven't upload our made it yet so

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,090
I don't but you get then I guess let's

21
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,369
talk about clickbait clickbait is a

22
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,960
beautiful term and what it means is when

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,210
the title serves one purpose that's to

24
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,950
get you to click and it can be like two

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,140
horribly misleading but as long as you

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,690
clicked the bait has succeeded okay I

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,250
don't I don't I don't believe in click

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,840
there's like a lot of caveats here

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,360
clickbait at times can be just egregious

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,820
and horribly misleading and the rule

31
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,209
that I try to follow is to intrigue but

32
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,970
not mislead I want you to see the title

33
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,770
day hmm wonder what's going on there

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,020
click playing like oh this is great

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,340
that's intriguing

36
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,630
but if you click on the title you're

37
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,780
like this guy's foolish then I've misled

38
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,640
you sometimes you do a really good job

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,430
of this like the $21,000 first-class

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,190
seat great title totally intriguing and

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,709
perfectly accurate and then sometimes I

42
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,239
just totally screwed up and you guys

43
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,140
give me a hell for in the comments today

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,299

Philadelphia in the next couple of days

59
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,760
with an empty plane I know it's not a

60
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,110
lot of flight but I wanted to offer a

61
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,420
free ride if you're interested in going

62
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,280
to Philadelphia maybe you're thinking

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,930
like why would you fly someplace you

64
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,840
don't need to go but a private jet is

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,940
like this is like this is an empty

66
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,340
plenty to be like it's my plane this is

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,459
a Perry I'm in my lights this is a very

68
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,209
special opportunity so yes I am getting

69
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,330
my own private jet but I only get it for

70
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,560
like a half an hour flight or something

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,709
and I'm more like cargo than like the

72
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,110
actual like guests on the plane but

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,950
