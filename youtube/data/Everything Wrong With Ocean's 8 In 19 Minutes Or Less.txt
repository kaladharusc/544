1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,070
orange is the new book as you know

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,049
parole is a privilege just because

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,280
Ocean's eleven began with the

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,870
protagonist parole hearing doesn't mean

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,520
you got to make the all-female spin-off

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,109
do the same thing does everything need

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,760
to be nostalgia and parallels when

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,260
filming in New York never pass up the

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,550
opportunity to give us one of those

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,080
overhead helicopter shots of the city

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,160
Hollywood I bet I could make a whole

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
feature-length film called overhead porn

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,029
title sounds dirty but the contents are

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,650
boring hey my name is Monica there

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,880
anything else I can do for you I've

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,559
never known the hotel clerk to tell you

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,820
other name when checking out but

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,739
apparently that's this hotels policy and

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,480
Debbie uses it to her advantage I mean

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,739
she could have just glanced at her

21
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:41,879
nametag and it would have been the same

22
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,950
thing right and instead of saying some

23
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,440
horrible airport hotel we were hoping

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,760
that maybe we could get our original

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,710
room back Debbie is able to steal a room

26
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,480
using the previous tenants information

27
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,070
without the clerk asking if she wants to

28
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,840
use the credit card on file or how long

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,879
she plans to stay you better be in there

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,500
whether he is or isn't can someone tell

31
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,719
me his actual life span because I swear

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,660
it said 1963 to 2018 just a second ago

33
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,390
and now it says 1958 to 2017 so either

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,830
someone in the continuity department

35
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,360
needs to be fired or the oceans

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,979
franchise is setting up some ghost

37
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,780
conman spin-off because George Clooney's

38
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,549
right-hand man was Brad Pitt it was only

39
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,259
natural for the other half of gravity to

40
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,520
pick the other half of Benjamin Button

41
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
to be hers is it just me or are these

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
windshield wipers on to highest setting

43
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,409
for wiping off what appears to be

44
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,180
exactly zero amounts of rain Claude

45
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,400
Becker Claude Becker Claude Becker also

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,530
since when does GQ ever write this much

47
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,420
about a person underneath their name and

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,100
with article teasers this hard to read

49
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,659
on the cover and compounded a pass both

50
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,540
the banks cease to Taunus sounds amazing

51
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
yeah we got lucky won't be the last time

52
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,369
but before we start believing this plan

53
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,170
can work even with luck think about the

54
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,820
monstrous hurdles they need to jump to

55
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,590
even start this heist the first hurdle

56
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,390
finding a fading fashion designer who

57
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,159
was not only desperate but is also still

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,810
good friends with Anna Wintour who will

59
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,340
somehow convince a hot Hollywood actress

60
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,170
to wear her designs a jeweler's loupe

61
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,299
like this one is used for examining

62
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,070
stones between 2 and 10 inches from the

63
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,960
face there's no way a focal range on

64
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,610
this would see anything as far away as

65
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,020
across the street how long would it take

66
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,800
you to make

67
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,540
a piece of jewelry of the stones ready

68
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,190
cut I guess we also are concerned about

69
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,990
any ear witnesses on this extremely

70
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,820
crowded Street for being so precise w

71
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,570
sure does leave a lot of chance like as

72
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,460
if the F train is any worse than any

73
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,660
other train you could take if you're

74
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,650
going through Manhattan on the F train

75
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,630
route your other choices are usually the

76
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,550
B D or M trains and those aren't any

77
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,330
better or worse

78
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,580
wait BD m sorry say this looks like

79
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,230
you're just getting effed name ball

80
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,300
which real name eight-ball we use real

81
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,710
names around here this is some sort of

82
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,360
anti reservoir dogs' by us or something

83
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,700
that's when we get it yes

84
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,290
what's it because a nervous non

85
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,580
professional is exactly the kind of

86
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,200
person you would pronoun game in this

87
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,670
situation instead of running her through

88
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,360
the details

89
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
I get that cloning a pit or having fun

90
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,930
with daemon here wait for helping us

91
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,210
with the feline rescue project

92
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,560
apparently all it takes to get a meeting

93
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,150
with the hot celebrity is to donate to

94
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,530
their charity and they'll come to meet

95
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,000
you at a swanky restaurant at a moment's

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
notice just in time to move a jewel

97
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,660
heist plot along ok she's dressing her

98
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,290
anyway

99
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,230
I think page six just because Penelope

100
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,240
Stern is rumored to be using ROS to

101
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,830
dress her for the ball Daphne gets

102
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,600
jealous enough to track her down as if

103
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,280
someone like Daphne wouldn't then try to

104
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,870
find someone way better than ROS to

105
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,000
one-up her so-called rival do you want

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,900
me to set up a meeting I love Anne

107
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,270
Hathaway put her in all the things I set

108
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,160
all the things I know a real one you

109
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720
know you know what I mean is it the

110
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,610
usual practice of pickpockets to admire

111
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,020
their stolen goods with a bunch of

112
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,790
people standing around him gets notice

113
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,170
to her gets ignored and for once we want

114
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,640
to be ignored setting aside that we

115
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,140
weren't even really asking for an

116
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,670
explanation as to why the whole team is

117
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,860
made up of women isn't this the opposite

118
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,480
of true when it comes to the Met Gala

119
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,730
aren't all eyes on the women while every

120
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,050
single male is wearing the same black

121
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,820
tux with very few distinguishing

122
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,010
features seriously what she even mean by

123
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,200
this just how exactly does Tammy have

124
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,670
Debbie's current number on her phone

125
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,500
Debbie's been in jail for five years so

126
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,090
unless she's been paying her phone bills

127
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,620
all that time this caller ID is a lie

128
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,690
sweetheart I will be right there

129
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,520
little kid wouldn't immediately run over

130
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,140
to where her mom is as soon as she said

131
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,040
something not that it would really

132
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,600
matter since this kid has no idea what

133
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
Debbie's presence even means but this

134
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,480
movie is trying to make us think it does

135
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,900
we would like to present you all with a

136
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,640
hypothetical situation and we'd like to

137
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,260
do it with a high-tech expositional

138
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,910
PowerPoint that includes full video

139
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,620
graphic overlay and animations because

140
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,630
our evidence trail just isn't quite long

141
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,220
enough yet considered to be one of the

142
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,549
most exclusive

143
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,609
most the most exclusive party invitation

144
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,590
in America really I'm calling out

145
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,270
Sandra's bollocks here how can you be

146
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,889
sure that there aren't any more

147
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,449
exclusive parties you don't even know

148
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,979
about I mean me and my college roommates

149
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,599
through a super Bomberman tournament for

150
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,729
just our closest friends in 1995 and

151
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,650
only seven people knew about that so

152
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,990
nice try ladies you just tell me one dev

153
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,940
for a MetroCard that's it how about this

154
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,979
we steal fifty million dollars I'll buy

155
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,240
everybody MetroCard

156
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,310
yeah that's funny at all but Constance

157
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,229
needs the MetroCard before you steal all

158
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,879
that money so what's the freaking point

159
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,770
besides this Constance or anyone else

160
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,240
not have enough money to pay for a

161
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,370
monthly MetroCard why not ask Lou who's

162
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,810
debbie the last word on Metro cards

163
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,539
maybe just um I said uh whores

164
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,990
Oh feel me my fault good grief the whole

165
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,880
reason why Cartier allows Rose to look

166
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,349
at the Tucson is because she speaks

167
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,270
French to them and appeals to their ego

168
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,380
in some stupid way the whole reason

169
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,610
they're being stubborn is for good

170
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,380
reason the piece would require any new

171
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,630
insurance policy and a security team but

172
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,889
now that somebody knows how to speak

173
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,509
French to them they forget all that

174
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,940
Wow what a technological wonder glasses

175
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,469
with crystal clear heads-up display

176
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,000
where the lenses somehow disguise all

177
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,319
the graphics from everyone else in the

178
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,180
room so you get a two-way mirror and a

179
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,889
computer screen all in one not to

180
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,630
mention being able to sustain VR levels

181
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,250
of clarity with this tech so close to

182
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,039
your eyes this is some BS tact

183
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,620
she must have this son this works oh

184
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,610
come on

185
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,259
some of these glasses create a perfect

186
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,180
AR overlay so you know exactly which

187
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,099
parts have been scammed up a hell movie

188
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,659
simple percentages aren't good enough

189
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,639
for you anymore also considering this

190
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,080
necklace is completely symmetrical

191
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,909
couldn't you just have scanned half of

192
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,289
it and saved yourself some of the

193
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:51,520
precious time from this completely

194
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,259
manufactured tension look I'm all for

195
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,819
these pair of glasses that can scan

196
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,560
images and send those images over Wi-Fi

197
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,360
I just don't know why it would take this

198
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,009
long to do it considering these classes

199
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,509
are already do perfect what's one more

200
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,550
thing thank you are you gonna light up

201
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,529
the sky good god and how the way steals

202
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,389
this movie a difficult feat with so many

203
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,979
great actors I'm gonna remove another

204
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,440
Hathaway sit if you like him you go

205
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,319
right and if you don't I don't I mean

206
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,599
Kaling and discount Evian here are truly

207
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,699
hilarious but is there anyone under the

208
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,259
age of 40 who doesn't know how tender

209
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,789
works even if they've never used it

210
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,740
before Oh Hollywood is remaking famous

211
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,089
paintings now the museum's agreement

212
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,320
with your father so let me get this

213
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,639
straight he planted a painting in the

214
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,090
museum so they would have the Sookie

215
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,470
the meeting that you could buck and

216
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,790
somehow you not only knew exactly when

217
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,870
they would call the meeting but where

218
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,460
also you decided to wait until the

219
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,750
meeting had already started to place the

220
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,130
bug rather than doing it at a less

221
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,350
conspicuous time moving a camera mm-hmm

222
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,560
it bit 1012 these how long did it take

223
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,180
you to figure all this out there is no

224
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,680
way that Debbie while in prison knew

225
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
about the camera just outside of the

226
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,380
bathroom at the met and she definitely

227
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,850
didn't know how long it would take to

228
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,260
move the camera so that it made an

229
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,790
effective blind spot I don't care if she

230
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,530
did win an Oscar for the Blind Side well

231
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,310
that was easy

232
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,440
also once again the oceans crew gets

233
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,000
lucky because the person who works at an

234
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,979
important place is a moron why does the

235
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,840
video window have a JPEG file extension

236
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,040
couldn't be some sort of video file

237
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,720
extension instead and considering its a

238
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
live feed why is it a filename at all

239
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
instead of some sort of network address

240
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,139
well you certainly seem qualified this

241
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,120
plan has too many moving parts now they

242
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,770
have to get Tammy hired at Vogue so that

243
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,150
she can arrange the seating chart at the

244
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,680
gala to their liking they had to somehow

245
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,389
give their previous coordinator chiggers

246
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,430
of all things and have vogue so

247
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,900
desperate that they hired Tammy on the

248
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,030
spot and have Anna Wintour so

249
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,740
preoccupied with a tennis match that the

250
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,780
hire takes place immediately but don't

251
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,220
worry I'm sure Debbie thought about all

252
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,580
this while in prison you have that

253
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,380
interview for the Mets top position do

254
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,810
it hey pointless Anna Wintour cameo /

255
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,090
roger federer joke is sure to confuse at

256
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,660
least 99 percent of the audience Taylor

257
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,110
Shaw white that's racist his publicist

258
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,419
was into it I barely hit her ass so wait

259
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:00,710
a minute how do they invite Claude

260
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,510
Becker whom is Debbie's ex-boyfriend to

261
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,190
come to the gala and somehow sweep

262
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,139
Daphne off her feet and instantly become

263
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,880
her date this is well before Daphne is

264
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,770
even in on it so what if she didn't like

265
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,060
Claude Becker what if you happen to be

266
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,530
dating someone at the time this is yet

267
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,760
another thing Debbie couldn't have known

268
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,590
when she planned this in prison you

269
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,700
better tell me this it's not what I

270
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,370
think it is what Claude Becker geez how

271
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,900
paint by oceans is this movie gonna be

272
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,389
to seek loo knock and pitch yet having

273
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,580
the exact same conversation as in 11:00

274
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,229
is making me wonder why they didn't just

275
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,270
go full psycho remake route and shop or

276
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,440
shot the whole thing throughout this

277
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,630
entire film expert hacker 9-ball does a

278
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,490
whole bunch of stuff in public that well

279
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm not saying they necessarily get

280
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,849
caught significantly raises the danger

281
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,050
of them getting caught these are the

282
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,360
crown jewels from eight Royal families

283
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,020
of Europe

284
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,669
that's probably why there's mote mote

285
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,230
shadowing

286
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,120
let me just see so how does it work

287
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,009
there is no way that phone is taking

288
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,459
video of that necklace problem with

289
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,819
Mouse

290
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:54,410
I guess Rose is only sending her

291
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,149
messages to Lou it's almost like this

292
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,680
movie realized it was wasting cate

293
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,850
blanchett and needed to give her

294
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,620
something anything to give her more

295
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,540
screen time so it seems like they use

296
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,939
Polly magnets and a spring why in the

297
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,139
world is Veronica I need to check all

298
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,999
this stuff out and give updates on this

299
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,199
loud-ass subway train

300
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,480
also convenient magnet expert sister is

301
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,699
a magnet expert I mean her sister

302
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,709
I mean convenient hey Anne Hathaway and

303
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,329
Katie Holmes are here did someone forget

304
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:25,430
to invite maggie gyllenhaal considering

305
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,389
there were several people in this

306
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:27,920
bathroom I'm pretty sure discount to

307
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
sunny here would have been noticed

308
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,249
almost immediately also how convenient

309
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:32,749
that women at high society events only

310
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,730
use the restroom for non toilet related

311
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,259
activities because she didn't even

312
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,999
glance to see if any of these stalls

313
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:44,809
were occupied in the first place come on

314
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,339
like security wouldn't have had a plan

315
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:47,870
in case daphne needed to go to the

316
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,550
bathroom this is supposedly the best

317
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,990
security in the world trusted to guard

318
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,149
the pope but fire on the amazon here is

319
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:55,160
gonna stop them from walking in all my

320
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,629
ladies still in the dark

321
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,879
but are they though and as much of a big

322
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,290
deal as they make out of this bathroom

323
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,059
blind spot it really doesn't do anything

324
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,009
other than hide the actual handoff right

325
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,930
I mean known criminal Debbie ocean is

326
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,430
seen entering the area right before the

327
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,870
vomiting episode she single-handedly

328
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,850
keeps security from entering and they

329
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,170
know this is when it went missing it

330
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,370
doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to piece

331
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,720
this together in fact I'm not even sure

332
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,459
Katie Holmes wouldn't figured it out and

333
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,470
did Marcia Clark just break the security

334
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,480
camera fourth wall and shrug they do

335
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,309
realize they're committing an actual

336
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,110
crime right it's not even like the

337
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,000
stupid necklaces even hidden very well

338
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,040
on the tray sure it's possible that the

339
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,689
busboy would have been too distracted to

340
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,100
see it but you know what else is

341
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,779
possible about a gazillion other

342
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,339
scenarios where someone spots this

343
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,899
necklace before the ladies of larceny

344
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,939
take care of it good God hold the

345
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:39,350
priceless jewels out in the open for a

346
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,809
really long time I don't yet your

347
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,370
attention before I've even hidden this

348
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,439
stolen merchandise these seriously may

349
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,120
be the lousy estai stirs that ever heist

350
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,459
at a heist let's ignore the fact that

351
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,170
somehow all this would have had to have

352
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,519
been planted in this bathroom and

353
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,990
organized like this at some point before

354
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,730
let's even grant them for some reason no

355
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,740
one needed to change a baby or use that

356
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,690
machine or even accidentally found it

357
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,459
since then tell me this how does she

358
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,110
remove all of this evidence when she

359
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,660
leaves holy is that a camera in the

360
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,250
kitchen directly looking at the sink

361
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,139
where amita held up the necklace how is

362
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,940
it Mita not in all the trouble after

363
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,709
this thing is over this supposedly tense

364
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,690
moment is decidedly less tense when you

365
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,949
think about how this door should be

366
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:20,269
locked and there's no way this

367
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,920
independent security detail got the keys

368
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,810
to every door in the museum what the

369
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,760
hell in the water as if it just

370
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,800
magically disabled the magnetic clasp

371
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,480
and flung off her neck I'll show you

372
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,889
might be asking why they didn't just put

373
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,180
the fake necklace on Daphne in the

374
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,649
bathroom and avoid all this bullshit

375
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,880
well it's because they needed the room

376
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,529
evacuated while the remaining crew was

377
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,360
pulling off yet another heist that will

378
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,070
be explained later the problem is how

379
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,510
much money do you need you were going to

380
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,190
walk away with a boatload of cash after

381
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,899
you steal this necklace even with a loss

382
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:48,980
of what it will take to frame

383
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,630
jean-claude van dump this thing right

384
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,459
here nearly screws up both operations

385
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,260
all because that amount of money is not

386
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,360
enough also speaking of that fancy

387
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,459
magnetic clasp has anyone noticed that

388
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,899
this fake replacement doesn't have one

389
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,370
considering it was a last-second thing

390
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,019
and magic magnet sister-girl

391
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,579
only brought them an unlocking tool

392
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:05,990
there's no way they would have had time

393
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,310
to put one on the decoy it's like the

394
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,720
security and the criminals are having a

395
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,990
dumbassery contest it should be noted

396
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,610
that Amita did not unlock this door

397
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,199
before opening it when she clearly

398
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,790
locked it earlier and don't give me that

399
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,170
she had to help Cate Blanchet later

400
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,790
stuff because you know she would have

401
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,079
locked that door once she was done

402
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,029
Constance gives everybody their share of

403
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:24,589
the diamonds and for the most part it's

404
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,449
a slick passing of the baton through the

405
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,339
gala floor except when she gives Rose

406
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,079
hers where the diamonds are in full view

407
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,120
of any camera watching why did they even

408
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,880
need to hand off the diamonds now anyway

409
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,829
[Music]

410
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:38,389
of the many parts of this plan that

411
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,639
strain credulity the idea that after a

412
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,139
long-term relationship with this woman

413
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,209
that he wouldn't recognize her because

414
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,860
she put on an accent and a new hair

415
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,810
color is probably the strangest I'm

416
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,889
sorry but I have to take this

417
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,660
opportunity to rant a bit more about the

418
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,190
camera problem we've established that

419
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,810
the only place the cameras can't see is

420
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,639
a small spot by the bathrooms created by

421
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,709
9-ball which means there is now recorded

422
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:58,970
evidence of every single one of the team

423
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,980
doing everything else they did hiding in

424
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,480
the bathrooms check placing the necklace

425
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,949
check entering the ball looking like

426
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,540
Rihanna after the lockdown already

427
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,160
happened check and now they're all

428
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,630
leaving the ball in a different state

429
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,579
than they came in sure for some of them

430
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,200
it's just extra jewelry but

431
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,910
others are on camera as kitchen staff

432
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,769
and now leaving us fancy-schmancy guests

433
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,300
but good thing they created that little

434
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,339
camera shelter and everything Qumu be

435
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,740
first of all I'm not a member of law

436
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,360
enforcement I work with the insurance

437
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,230
carrier huh

438
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,970
luckily for the entire ocean screw law

439
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,680
enforcement never gets involved in the

440
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,480
heist of a necklace valued at 150

441
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,399
million just James Corden because Jimmy

442
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,019
Fallon wasn't available I guess it was

443
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,149
my week hilarious misunderstanding that

444
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,740
would in no way happen whatsoever if

445
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,420
John introduced himself as an insurance

446
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,160
investigator and what he was here for

447
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,690
which he surely did before this

448
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,670
interview even started servers on

449
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,800
YouTube were alone while you were

450
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,050
wearing the necklace not pictured the

451
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,510
security guys for some reason and when

452
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,600
did they have time for this you guys are

453
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,680
it's a fun little twist and everything

454
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,709
and nice pg-13 placement as well but I'm

455
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,510
still a little shaky on the details here

456
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,130
her explanation seems to indicate that

457
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,050
petty Kluger here didn't finally put all

458
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,279
the pieces together until she was

459
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,260
interrogated so how did she even find

460
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,300
the oceans crew after that excuse me you

461
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,790
are trespassing oh we asked her to come

462
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,560
and didn't tell you guys for some reason

463
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
we think it's better that not only is

464
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,170
the audience surprised but our entire

465
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,720
team is too and I almost never throw up

466
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,250
this is Daphne's explanation for how she

467
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,779
knew something was up the whole time but

468
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,130
it's still kind of amazing she didn't

469
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,240
freak out when the necklace was stolen

470
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,980
she didn't know who's behind it until

471
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,390
she was interviewed by the insurance guy

472
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,949
so just because she knew something was

473
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,600
up doesn't mean she'd be so calm about

474
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,490
it like she knew she was gonna befriend

475
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,589
these people later and last but not

476
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,399
least I never forget a face so what are

477
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,839
you part of the IMF or something do you

478
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,910
scan the room for faces so you can tell

479
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,829
Kittredge you saw the other IMF team the

480
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,209
waiter was standing behind Hannah at the

481
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,430
top of the stairs bowtie 12 o'clock his

482
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,370
name is John Frasier you know him yes he

483
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,350
busted my father twice my brother wants

484
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,390
his family so because he busted Debbie's

485
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,010
father twice and her brother once

486
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,620
he just likes you or something also is

487
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,760
this the only guy who does insurance

488
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,050
investigation how the hell does he

489
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,459
manage to run into the same people

490
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:02,870
committing crimes over and over and that

491
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,910
just happened to be related boyfriend

492
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,440
yep they were gonna be looking for

493
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,160
somebody

494
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,449
Debbie's plan also requires the

495
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,920
professional con man Claude Becker

496
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,449
doesn't notice heavy diamonds being

497
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:12,949
slipped into his coat pocket or that he

498
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,209
would notice them at any time when he

499
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,889
got home or gave the coat to somebody to

500
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,240
be dry-cleaned

501
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,589
don't have that any close female

502
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,209
friendships you're becoming a criminal

503
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,140
because you're lonely

504
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,610
tam-tam would be excellent at cinema

505
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,060
sets it's not just Pro fades revenge

506
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,680
it's a twofer yeah and Debbie Does

507
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,750
callous here is for some reason being

508
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,370
very transparent with you about framing

509
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,260
her ex because she trusts you I guess

510
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,550
but in what world is an insurance

511
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,529
adjustor the final say on a criminal

512
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,149
investigation are the police not doing

513
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,410
their own investigation is he not

514
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,000
worried about being an accessory to the

515
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,100
whole thing he friends you you frame him

516
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,899
scores are settled I'm just the courier

517
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,279
all is right with the world it's

518
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,839
brilliant it's at this point that I wish

519
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,220
Debbie and the rest had just gotten away

520
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,899
with it this little epilogue or whatever

521
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,160
the hell it is drags the movie right

522
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,870
down it asks you to swallow a lot just

523
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,339
because you want Debbie to get away with

524
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:56,720
it Debbie apparently knew that John

525
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,370
Fraser would be conducting an insurance

526
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,660
investigation but she did not know

527
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,100
Daphne would figure out the plan and

528
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,390
went to help them so what was the plan

529
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,160
to frame Claude if Daphne wasn't in on

530
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,899
it you know what time for 20 extra sins

531
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,040
for all the things Debbie couldn't have

532
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,080
known when she planned this this totally

533
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,370
means that she slept with him after

534
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,899
obtaining the evidence doesn't it damn

535
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,240
girl why would you just steal one

536
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,630
necklace when you could steal one the

537
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,310
thing about this final hice prevail is

538
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,870
that it's about something we have zero

539
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,459
investment in sure you wanted to keep it

540
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,140
as a final twist from both us and the

541
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,550
rest of the gals for some reason but we

542
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,050
never felt any of the tension or joy of

543
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,730
the job because we didn't even know

544
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,350
about it until after it was over it had

545
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,850
absolutely very little to do with the

546
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,410
heist that we thought we cared about and

547
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,420
makes this final reveal feel unnecessary

548
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,200
and anticlimactic

549
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,329
also there's absolutely no reason why

550
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:39,740
the rest of the crew wasn't in on this

551
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,459
from the beginning

552
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,079
I guess it's fun to spring surprises on

553
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,310
your criminal buddies and what's more

554
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,420
she didn't even show them the other

555
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,829
necklaces until someone told her the

556
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,420
math didn't add up for everyone Cher I

557
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,310
spent a lot of time in gangs and someone

558
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,050
would have got shot for that also also

559
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,040
this might have been good information

560
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,079
for 9-ball to know considering she was

561
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,640
the one looking at the security monitors

562
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,260
the whole time and helping them out with

563
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,910
certain issues like when the security

564
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,279
shows up Amazon sells these 20-foot

565
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,800
selfie sticks all they saw was a quick

566
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,600
little blur damn it movie just when I

567
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,280
think I'm done talking about the cameras

568
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,780
you pull me back in does no one remember

569
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,270
these cameras are recording everything a

570
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,949
quick little blur where the cameras not

571
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,449
on while you were setting up this ruse

572
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,040
even if there are only two cameras in

573
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,630
this highly important room wouldn't the

574
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,490
one camera have a shot of you trying to

575
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,140
fool the other camera not to mention

576
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,429
there's no way to get that equipment in

577
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:23,929
either camera without the camera first

578
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,760
seeing you plus there are other cameras

579
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,350
watching you enter the room leave the

580
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,939
room

581
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,710
we distract security outside the room

582
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,480
there's so many cameras camera ring the

583
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,279
camera cameras the camera camera camera

584
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,929
count also you needed to have an

585
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,639
existing picture from this angle to pull

586
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,259
this off so when did you guys get one

587
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,090
and since when two iPhones display full

588
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,710
screen still photos when the actual

589
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,480
camera is on I see a number of times

590
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,549
where Yin probably tripped the alarm on

591
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,409
this thing but who cares it's fun right

592
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,779
also did they pay yen a discount rate to

593
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:51,220
do all this because remember they're

594
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,289
still dividing all of the money by 8 so

595
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,179
I guess Yin did this for a couple grand

596
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:57,639
maybe I won't have to organise his event

597
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,139
once again this prevents a guard from

598
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:00,429
seeing anything I think I should add

599
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:01,870
about 20 cents for the realisation that

600
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,850
almost every aspect of this plant from

601
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,860
its inception to its execution probably

602
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,269
would have ended up failing look at me

603
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,759
fellows I'm handing out wings and look

604
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm not done after that necklace got

605
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,759
stolen security would have done a whole

606
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,169
sweep of the area to make sure there

607
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,059
wasn't anyone unaccounted for inside now

608
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,769
so I skipped this important wing of the

609
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,779
museum there is no way at the speed this

610
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,460
toy boat is moving that Lu had time to

611
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,019
exchange every single one of these jewel

612
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,580
pieces back and forth the Lou Diamond

613
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,259
physics just wouldn't work but wait

614
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,029
wasn't a meet up busy taking diamonds

615
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,799
off that necklace the whole time this

616
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,149
other heist was going on when did she

617
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,039
have time for this also did Mindy

618
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,480
project really have to stop her

619
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,309
jewellery assembly job to join Lou on

620
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:38,049
the trip to this truck just to open one

621
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,610
door and shut another one she couldn't

622
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,110
take care of that herself you know it's

623
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,970
great when your team of thieves can hop

624
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,590
onto a train without anyone else on it

625
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,450
so you can get an awesome group shot

626
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,039
without any other assholes blocking the

627
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,380
frame

628
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,900
I was just wondering how many cameras

629
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,789
you got there in that town somewhere in

630
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,200
the vicinity of 5,000

631
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,720
oh that's a lot of cameras nice watch

632
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,880
it's my brother's five long years he

633
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,220
wore this watch up his ass then he died

634
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,320
of dysentery while landing his launches

635
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,520
the same thing didn't you learn about

636
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,850
that it's rainy spectacular great big

637
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,190
blingy big old Liz Taylor jewels that

638
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,320
are locked in about 50 feet underground

639
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,380
you ought to be free I do not deny that

640
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,860
my heart has greatly desired this how

641
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,450
long is it gonna take us to build a

642
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,530
nine-foot blind spot

643
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,940
Tony here's your quarterback all right

644
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,799
you protect his blindside when you look

645
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,929
at him you think of me now that looks

646
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,870
like a fast dog is that faster than a

647
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,179
greyhound you put him in a race who

648
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,890
would come in first you had a little

649
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,850
jockey on him

650
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,909
cheers Cheers hey I'll be right back

651
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:47,779
I'll be right something man you can't be

652
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,460
I have gel in my hair I haven't slept

653
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,649
all night I'm starved and I'm armed

654
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,000
don't mess with me
