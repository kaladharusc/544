00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,010
anywhere all right well here we go we're

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,180
gonna have a bunch of questions here

67
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,650
that there be famous here's a question

68
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,680
for you whose mood it's harder to gauge

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,390
like whose mood is harder to be around

70
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,310
like when we switch moods who's smart of

71
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,650
him are you yeah like who's a little

72
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,330
more crazier with their boats and I

73
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,500
think of him maybe like when you were a

74
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,430
kid versus me now now he's super easy to

75
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,410
be right but when he was a kid when you

76
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,060
were a kid I had extraneous yeah yeah

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,130
you're a rough neighborhood you know

78
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:20,510

79
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,669

now like me do some well now I know how

82
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,430
to manage people better when I was a kid

83
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,260
was probably harder because I don't know

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,910
what I was doing but now he's very

85
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,419
