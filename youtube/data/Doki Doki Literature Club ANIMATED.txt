16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,640
Doesn't a good cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,520
I DON'T TRUST YOU, YURI!!

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,080
That's good enough for me! What about you, Yuri?

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,160
*with accent* Yuri?

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,200
She's still sulking, she's dead inside...

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,320
...just like everybody else is gonna be dead on the outside!

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,160
I wrote...

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,720
Butthole on one, just in case someone's favourite word is butthole, You'll never know!

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,160
Aardvark, for people who enjoy the beginning of the dictionary, you know. (Or for Arthur cos he just took it)

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,220
Uh... Markiplier, for people that don't want a cupcake. (Sayori: LETS BACK IT UP!)

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,400
Anyway, I'd say, I'm gonna go with Monika. I know Sayori probably needs to be by her side right now, but

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,160
EH!

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,280
What's this? I flipped to Sayori's poem. It's one that I haven't read before.

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,080

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,720
Sayori? Wake up dummy! There's no response, I gently open the door-

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,020
WASTED

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,680
