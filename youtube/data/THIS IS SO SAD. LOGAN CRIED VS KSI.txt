1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,420
waaaaaalllmaaarttt (echos)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,620
*smiles*

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,000
Youtube has become a reality TV show, everybody,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from Tanacon, to Fouseytube

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,400
toooooooooooooooo (drumroll please)

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
the fight between KSI and Logan Paul and Jake Paul and Deji

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,580
i wasn't even gonna watch it...

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,580
i didnt even care when i heard about it

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,620
but then the memes *ding *

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,000
the beautiful- the beautiful memes.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,560
wherever there is memes

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
i will be there (to kill them)

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,580
and the last press conference was a beautiful thing

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:38,600
Jake/Logan: (chants a curse upon KSI and Deji)

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,360
waaallmaaart

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,600
last conference was in LA,

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
this one took place in UK, if you ask me

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,000
the Paul brothers won the first press conference

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,400
they just went full meme

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
KSI and the Deji? they just weren't ready for it

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,120
*chuckles*

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,540
you can tell

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,680
(logan paul impostor stares into your soul)

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,600
so now this one takes place in UK

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
and no one like the Pauls in UK

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Jake Paul : Aye! Y'all dumbasses say anything ELSE?!

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Deji: BOOORING! (Deji chants his curse upon jake)

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,660
Crowd: BOORING! (crowd makes curse stronger)

29
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,460
Jake: Y'all say anything else?

30
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,600
P: like, Walmart

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
*giggles*

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,500
you guys keep saying the same thing, WALMAAAAAAAAART

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,600
*laughs*

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
their press conference started off, half of it is completely normal,

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,800
because -  because it's not youtubers involved,

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,440
it's actual boxers.

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,860
True Geordie (ref): &quot;You used to be a boxer?&quot;

38
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,520
Undercard guy 1:&quot;YEAH&quot;

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,180
person: we owned this charity called rethink.or-

40
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,860
pewds: no one cares

41
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,600
blah blah blah charity this charity that c'mon

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,340
Jake: yeah.

43
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,600
pewds: then the youtuber comes out

44
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Jake: Boo if Deji's a bitch! *Crowd Boos* (x2)

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,320
pewds: they fell - i can't, i mean the audience must feel de-destroyed right now

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,820
i cant believe they fell for that

47
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,600
oldest trick in the book. well played Jake.

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,900
Jake (Dumbass): Thought you guys were on Deji's team?

49
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,020
YEEEEAAH (mating call)

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,980
DID SOMEONE THRoW AN AIRPLANE???

51
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
(repeats mating call)

52
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:06,820
basically, people kept throwing things on stage and the ref got so done.

53
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,440
Jake: Respect. (all about it in japan according to logan)

54
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,940
Geordie: &quot;Don't be throwing anything&quot;

55
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,160
Jake: &quot;Yeah&quot;

56
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Geordie: Don't be throwing nothing, alright?

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,960
Spoilers, people gonna keep throwing stuff (how could you)

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,520
even outside there was a riot and people throw,

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
G Fuel (dramatic sound effect)

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
can you believe this?!?!?! (no)

61
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,060
Who just throws G Fuel (beings of pure evil)

62
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,260
Geordie: Alright,

63
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,260
And his opponent...

64
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,880
It's Deji.  *crowd cheers*

65
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,340
pewds: and then out comes Deji and he finally has,

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,060
a crowd that cheers for him (for the first time)

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,240
(Havana by Camila Cabello plays ?????? I don't really know tbh)

68
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:42,460
(Jakes bodyguard becomes an overprotective mother)

69
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,320
AH, AH

70
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
LOOK AT THE PIT STAINS

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,180
HE'S SWEATING!!!!!

72
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,500
Jake: Look at his pit stains!

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,240
Jake: HE'S SWEATING! (which is heresy)

74
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,040
Jake: LOOK AT THE PIT STAINS!

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Jake: HE'S SWEATING! (watch for spanish inquisition)

76
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,860
Geordie: Don't be throwing anything.

77
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,700
Jake: (mating call)

78
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,800
Geordie: (essentially repeats)

79
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
(mating bird gets attacked by hawk)

80
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,000
(not captioning this, Jake Paul is retarded)

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,740
Geordie: -cause it's an easier fight. Is that true?

82
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,340
(another hawk)

83
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,700
Can we stop throwing (BRRR) because everyone's gonna go home.

84
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,120
Jake: Next boxing gym: home of 0 world champions.

85
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
Deji: 0 world champions?!

86
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,180
(Geordie tries to talk to Jake but Jake's too focused on why his mating calls have no effect)

87
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,040
*patting the mic*

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
YOUR GYM IS BAD

89
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,780
*continues patting the mic*

90
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,860
YOUR GYM IS TRASHED

91
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,060
Jake: (repeats)

92
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,620
*jake pats the mic*

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,660
Jake: C'mon in today to Vic's boxing gym! We train Deji and that's it.

94
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,060
Deji: DAMN STRAIGHT! DAMN STRAIGHT!

95
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,320
Deji: THAT'S HOW IT IS!

96
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,020
pewds: (feels the cringe) oh my god, the comebacks are so dumb, and so bad.

97
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,120
here's what he's saying

98
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,760
you don't say, &quot;Yeah, that's it!&quot; you say, &quot;Yeah, they only need to train the Number 1!&quot;

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,400
or

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,420
&quot;Yeah, I don't even need training to break your spleen right now.&quot;

101
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,740
but then they get into the real stuff, the really important

102
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,600
the-the comical observations

103
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,060
like, &quot;What are you wearing?&quot;

104
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,020
Jake : He's still dressed like BRRR

105
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,880
TrueGeordie : Do you think he's deliberately uploading like these lots of (...) for this fight?

106
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,200
TrueGeordie : Do you think Jake Paul is putting minimum training footage.

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,440
Jake : At least try on the second-

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,420
TrueGeordie : JAKE! JAKE, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN ALRIGHT? (geordie puts jakey to nappy)

109
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,440
TrueGeordie : Do you think that Jake is deliberately putting bare minimum videos up to make it look like he's not training

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,060
so he's got excuses or d'you just think he's trying to hide it from you?

111
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,860
here's the question.

112
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,580
Do you think Jake is putting up bare minimum videos to sh- hide that he's actually training?

113
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,920
What is the answer to the question?

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
Deji: I just hope he can fight better than he can dress.

115
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,660
cuz Jake dress like BRRR.

116
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,280
You are actual BRRR.

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
You are actual BRRR.

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,620
u dwess bad. no U dwess bad. Uh-huh. no U dwess bad *laughs*

119
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,340
Jake: Let it out. Let it out. -----
Deji: Yeah, whose period blood is that.

120
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,660
Whose period b- YOU'RE WEARING RED TOO!

121
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,620
god dammit

122
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
TrueGeordie: Deji is clearly smaller than you.

123
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,340
Deji: My man, you're still wearing heels.

124
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,120
Jake : There's zero percent chance that Deji wins this fight.
Deji: Why are you wearing high heels?

125
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,040
(Jake repeats while Geordie peeks)

126
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,720
*chuckles* the ref checks if he's actually wearing high heels *laughs*

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,760
he's like... &quot;Those are high heels actually&quot;

128
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,460
*ukulele note plays as a crow flies*

129
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,640
TrueGeordie: No touching.

130
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,280
TrueGeordie : Don't throw anything. C'mon.

131
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,880
Deji: (chanting) Leave the stage! Leave the stage!

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,520
Deji: Yeah YEAH

133
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,660
*earrape*

134
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,660
honestly I think Jake Paul won that one because he actually delivered insults and despite being,

135
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,780
fish out of water. it's all Deji fans here. It's all KSI's fans

136
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,160
he handled himself well i thought.

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,640
Deji didn't really say any thing.

138
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,420
B U T  T H E N

139
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,560
when it looked like it was all over

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,440
Deji delivers the fattest line, the most devastated line i-of the century

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,880
*epic music* i have never heard an insult so efficient that it completely switched the whole thing around

142
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,540
and Deji won it.

143
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,920
Deji: (chanting) Suck your mum, suck your mum

144
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,040
(repeats) (chant is bass boosted as Deji insults Jake)

145
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,380
*crowd joins*

146
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,220
*a battle army joins*

147
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,700
suck your dad. suck your-

148
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,660
WHAT IS THIS *laughs* SO DUMB

149
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,820
TrueGeordie: What they installed, no more throwing BRRR seriously because the whole thing will stop straight away.

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,340
(hawk rebels)

151
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,280
Just do us all a favour.

152
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,200
next up Logan comes out and he looks like he had the worst s*** of his life i honestly

153
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,080
eh, i am a bit concerned about him

154
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,820
*fart sound*

155
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,900
*one more*

156
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,260
Pew : what is up with him? look at him

157
00:06:46,260 --> 00:07:02,780
*tragic low-key music plays as logan gets a Vietnam War flashback*

158
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,660
*earrape*

159
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,160
And then, out comes KSI

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,080
*crowd cheers as KSI with Logan Paul wig comes out*

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,580
Oh. snap.

162
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,800

163
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,500
he wore the wig.

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,320

165
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,240
*crowd cheering continues*

166
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,700
KSI: that walmart BRRR won't work here boi

167
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,460
*crowd cheers*

168
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,780
Pewds : what is he doing? he's just-

169
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,280
*pewds laughing*

170

*more laughter from pewds*

171
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,620
Pewds : Oh Logan!

172
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,360
...he looks like he's about to cry

173
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
KSI: Hasn't England already suffered enough?

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,180
We lost to Croatia in the semi-finals...

175
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,120
We had Trump come over last week...

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,400
NOW WE GOT *YOU* THIS WEEK!

177
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,060
*applause from the crowd*

178
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,900
KSI: How you feelin' bro?

179
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,700
he doesn't look like he's feeling well

180
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,340
you're literally in a room with a thousand people that just despise you

181
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,100
Jesus!

182
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,340
KSI: How are you, gonna try and audition for Baywatch...

183
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,080

184
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,020
and still not end up in the final movie?

185
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,220
*loud applause from the crowd*

186
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,560
My song ended up in the final movie!

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,200
Wher- Where were you?

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,220
Oh yeah...

189
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,700
DELETED SCENES. (ouch)

190
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,980
pewds: OHHHHHHHHHH *warped laugh*

191
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,940
?              ?

192
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,680
OHH OHH OHH

193
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,880
aww that's gotta hurt

194
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,820
the end of this is beautiful cuz he- he just stops going after Paul, Logan.

195
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,260
and he goes after her(!)- his parents instead (bad speak)

196
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,240
KSI: -lusional dad

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,720
*crowd*

198
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,800
You're disgusting, mate.

199
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,600
You said you'd beat me in the fight...

200
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,260
(repeats)

201
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,340
....with one hand right?

202
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,920
You wouldn't do BRRR!

203
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,960
You're an old man!

204
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,040
But I'm sure, I'm sure, you wouldn't mind lasting one round of all the little girls you like kissing.

205
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,100
Pewds: OHHH

206
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,060
*crowd cheers*

207
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,120
AHHA HOH

208
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,980
ugh

209
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,940
OHH OW DAMN OHH

210
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,380
oh my god, he looks like he's trying to be twenty.

211
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,360
KSI: YOU SICK, DEAD BEAT, BALD-HEADED PBRRK

212
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,540
Pewds : omg

213
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,400
KSI: How you gonna make not one but two dumbass children? (he has a point)

214
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,120
*crowd cheers rise*

215
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,240
The f- is wrong with your sperm?!

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,440
*pewds loses it*

217
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Logan Paul's father : If you wanna ask about the...

218
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,420
*KSI mocks*

219
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,660
...ASK YOUR MOM! (terrible your mom insult)

220
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,500
Pewds : oh wow
Logan Paul's father : ASK YOUR MOM

221
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,360
AHHH YOUR MOM

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,940
Jesus Christ

223
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,120
this thing is so DUMB i can't believe it *chuckles*

224
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,940
KSI: Is that lip quivering?
Logan : Yo! Hey!

225
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,620
KSI: Is that li- How's that lip?
Logan : Hey, I would

226
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,020
Logan : ...love to sit here...

227
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,360
and answer your questions...

228
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,100
I feel like KSI addressed everything.

229
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
London, I'm out!

230
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll see you in August 25th. (leaves like a girl)

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,040
Pewds : DAMN I CAN'T BELIEVE HE BAILED

232
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,560
(hero saves mic)

233
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,460
KSI: Oh where you going bro?

234
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,420
*trademark maniacal laughter*

235
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,520
*epic battle opening music*

236
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,780
Youtube is a strange place right now,

237
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,140
but it's entertaining at the very least

238
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,480
at least we have that,

239
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,040
at least it's not boring,

240
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
(reads) Logan Paul has disconnected from The Lobby

241
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,860
*chuckles*

242
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,400
man, he didn't even try, did he? Jesus Christ.

243
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,940
next up is the fight. i don't know why i am so invested at this point (me with ur captions)

244
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,900
this is so dumb,

245
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,640
i hate how i'm invested. it's like when you watch trash TV (love island)

246
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,300
and you're like, &quot;Why am I watching this?!&quot;

247
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,180
no. i don't want - just go away

248
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,120
Deji, uhh, seemed like no one was rooting for him, like

249
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,880
all his friends, Keemstar, they're all like, &quot;Ah...

250
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,680
...I don't think he can beat Jake.

251
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,020
Jake is a lot bigger.&quot;

252
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,720
but i felt bad for Deji. i was like, &quot;Damn!&quot;

253
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,340
especially after the LA conference, i'm like 'wow, no-one's rooting for him, he changed trainer--

254
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,180
but he's also such an idiot, he's also so dumb.

255
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,160
like, it's very conflicting emotions here.

256
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
i want to root for Deji, but he's just too much of a moron

257
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,140
but then again you have Jake, who's a double moron

258
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,960
i think the reason why this match is so interesting is because i don't care who wins.

259
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,000
it's the same thing, but what i hope happens is that Jake wins, over Deji,

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,520
because to be honest, i don't care who Deji fights next, right?

261
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,320
i would rather see Jake challenge someone else next-- that would actually be interesting

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,980
i think KSI's gonna beat Logan Paul, and i also hope that's gonna happen, not necessarily because i hope KSI's gonna win--

263
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,660
but-- Logan Paul, he probably had the worst year of his life, i do feel a little bad for him

264
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,280
he never really recovered after the whole Japanese incident

265
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,880
and yes, he's a moron, yes everyone knows now he's a moron, but-- i feel like---

266
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
there are definitely worse people on youtube

267
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,940
and then KSI can go on and challenge more people as well, so you have one winner from each team.

268
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,700
that's what I hope, at least, i don't know why i care,

269
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,520
i don't care, by the way, trust me, i don't care, like *laughs* could go either way-- I DON'T CARE, alright?

270
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,860
Why am i promoting this for free they're just going to claim the video like last one.

271
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:01,000
