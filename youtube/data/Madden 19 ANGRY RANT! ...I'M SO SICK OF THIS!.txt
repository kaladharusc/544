player motion makes its madden debut

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,500

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:40,490
fluidity that's that looks the same

36
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,409
they're passing this office brand-new

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,439
like this but it looks no different

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,450
it's either alone user controlled

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,600
celebrations

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,049
it took them 14 years and longshot is so

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,630
shitty they even removed dialogue

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,469
options they made it worse was already

43
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,739
mine a new progression that gets rid of

44
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,239
the old progression what if the Oprah

45
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,520
Gretchen is better

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,050
you can't you can't choose the way you

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,380
want to upgrade your teams now get

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,310
locked into teams and Mott teams okay

49
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,200
where you make all the fucking money

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,840
that's what's new this is not a football

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,660
this is not a football game anymore it

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,130
is a platform that that looks and plays

53
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,040
like football but every year they are

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,060
adding small small tiny little upgrades

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,550
that have we have requested for years

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,550
and years and years franchise mode

57
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,860
hasn't been touched forever wait five

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,870
years till everybody's super pissed and

59
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,790
then add one little thing two little

60
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,440
things to franchise mode and then people

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,810
will stop bitching but then add 17

62
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,600
things to the mutt mode where you make

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,690
this is why this is why Madden is the

64
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,700
same game every year and then I look at

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,730
the reviews and this is what I'm seeing

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,489
Madden NFL 19 and eight from ID from

67
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,220
GameSpot of King 9 from IGN and 8.9

68
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,959
that's what's the difference between a

69
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,330
nine and an eight point nine IGN

70
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,030
seriously what is it hmm

71
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,250

72

78
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,770
can create all 500 guys in the draft

79
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,730

85
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,200
depth chart positions just to sound

86

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:52,979
put the big ones they need these little

95
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:59,819
shifty eyes in this is sixty dollars

96
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,490
this is eight hundred million dollars

97
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,770
near a billion dollars and that's all we

98
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,319
get for franchise it's the same aim

99
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,050
every year the amount of things that are

100
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,810
being ignored in favor of all of this

101
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,849
all of this mutt mode crap and it breaks

102
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,190
my heart because everybody who used to

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,860
collect real physical football cards

104
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,479
cards with actual value because there's

105
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,610
signatures and you could go on the you

106
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,740
know trade market and all man I really

107
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,659
love that player I want memorabilia I

108
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,610
want things that I can own and pass on

109
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,880
to my children those people and there's

110
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,310
pieces of jerseys there's some crazy-ass

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,659
shit that they've included

112
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,060
in in card collecting these days and now

113
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,919
all of those people have been conned

114
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,409
into this new much mode where you're

115
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,029
collecting digital cards that are

116
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,610
completely fing worthless they can't be

117
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,710
passed on that have no fucking inherent

118
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,500
value only to that particular Madden for

119
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,319
that particular year and then it's done

120
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,229
so you're wasting thousands of dollars

121
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,180
there are people wasting thousands of

122
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,240
dollars in this mode and that is why

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,330
Madden barely upgrades every fucking

124
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,919
year because of those people and I'm

125
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,440
tired of staying silent about it and I'm

126
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,029
tired of our freakin journalists outlets

127
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,120
giving Madden nines and eights and tens

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,940
okay not tens because they know that

129
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,550
this shit is going on it's as if they

130
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,089
fucking assign a new reviewer to each

131
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,669
and every year's Madden so that they

132
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,380
have no perspective on

133
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,150
what was missing last year what was

134
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,740
taken out last year what needs to be

135
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,510
improved for next year they hire

136
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,280
somebody new and they think it's the

137
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,740
greatest Madden ever because of some

138
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,110
small real motion upgrade that then that

139
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,400
it should have been in the game five

140
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,890
years ago oh my god

141
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,200

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,520

168
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,320
don't count this is a little darker

169
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,460

170
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,520

172
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,090
dollars

173
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:48,120
why have I been waiting 15 years for us

174
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,360
to be able to customize our ad what

175
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,510
white option skin phase six they get two

176
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,570
more phases look at these fucking douche

177
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,900
bags Joe look at how awful they look -

178
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,060
why can't we create our own face at this

179
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,920
point like I'm basketball like in

180
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,470
fucking golf for Christ's sake and

181
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,170
you're telling me this game makes 600

182
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,900
million dollars annually I can't believe

183
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,820
that we're still dealing with this shit

184
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,950
they know people fucking want to create

185
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,639
themselves how

186
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:38,550
holy Sh 46 we only have huh look at

187
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:50,639
three and eight three oh god oh my jaw

188
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,350
we need to get a tan if we want to get

189
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,990
options on who we wanted to and I bet

190
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,820
you if we go through there's about half

191
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,529
of these are look at face 21 22 23 and

192
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,949
24 no shit that's the same fucking face

193
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:10,399
Wow Madden two thousand nine out of ten

194
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
says IGN my tattoos don't want Khushi I

195
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,399
know look at this I can't believe year

196
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,589
after year after year I hope that they

197
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:20,910
do something in that section and then

198
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,040
let's go and create our own team Joey go

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,540
back I want to create my own pain go

200
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,610
back for a bit I like how they word that

201
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,779
tweak don't tweak your uniform Isaac you

202
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,300
do you don't cut so I can't cook you're

203
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,940
telling me I can't create my own team I

204
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,250
can't create my own team that's why the

205
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,690
thing in years like eight nine years

206
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,040
you've not been able to get only

207
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,880
relocate yes so you have to pick like

208
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,529
the worst team you have to pick like the

209
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,569
Raiders or something where their fans

210
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,010
ate them and they want them to relocate

211
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,990
or something and you have to hope that

212
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,209
or the Browns and you have to hope that

213
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,970
baby then you'll hear three generic

214
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,970
presets I know and there's these preset

215
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,529
teams and I've been waiting for shit

216
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,630
like that forever so I can make a custom

217
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,639
league and play with the angry army and

218
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,199
everybody have their own fucking team

219
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,560
and you if there's ways to do it but

220
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,269
it's all hidden under this and it never

221
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:16,980
gets any attention because all the

222
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,889
attention is in Ultimate Team and they

223
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:22,800
can't overhaul Madden they can't

224
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,319
overhaul the franchise mode they can't

225
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:28,079
allow us to customize teams and you know

226
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,810
in a real and meaningful way they can't

227
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,010
add the RPG like elements or the goddang

228
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,920
Ingle player experience and creating

229
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,260
yourself like they do in the basketball

230
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,070
games

231
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,640
those those customization features are

232
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,430
far better than this this what is it

233
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,320
called the fucking what's the mote

234
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,780
called Joe the single-player mode and

235
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,620
Madden the longshot the garbage long

236
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,360
shot that is essentially it is so bad

237
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,100
they're taking features out look even

238
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,140
even GameSpot agrees with that they're

239
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,970
taking features out in no other genre in

240
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,050
gaming is this acceptable a $60 game

241
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,150
with countless microtransactions in them

242
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,920
it should be a free to play game with

243
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,280
how much money Madden makes on ultimate

244
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,800
team and how much time and effort and

245
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,550
development goes into the mutt modes

246
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,290
Madden should now be a free-to-play game

247
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,060
with all the micro transactions that are

248
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,680
in it for those that play that mode and

249
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,260
now they want to charge you $80 you're

250
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,690
they want to charge you $80 so that you

251
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,970
could go in and bust more packs and

252
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,590
spend even more money in the micro

253
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,580
transactions

254
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,150
what the hell what the hell has happened

255
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,760
to our football I'm done I'm done with

256
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,060
this rant but I might actually why am I

257
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,950
getting into Madden well not only did it

258
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,840
create the angry Joe show for those of

259
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,870
you who know that story but also it's

260
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,640
the first year it's out on pc and I was

261
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,680
considering picking it up and I go to

262
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,410
this screen and then I talk with Joe who

263
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,300
refuses this is the first year Joe is

264
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,520
refusing to buy or not right Joe even

265
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,700
Madden fans we're friends my friends

266
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,620
pressure Joe to buy that shit this year

267
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,470
Joe's like I'm my vitamin I'm not buying

268
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,690
it and I was like why how he's like I

269
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,070
did a roster update I was like how did

270
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,080
you go on did you like hacker console

271
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,440
get a file from the internet community

272
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,420
no there's actually the the stupidest

273
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,980
thing they could have done was they

274
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,010
allow community files now and drafts and

275
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,400
stuff so now people can just do the 2019

276
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,040
roster 2020 roster I was shocked that

277
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
they did that because

278
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,370
it almost invalidates their game you're

279
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,759
telling you I mean I mean no don't ruin

280
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,079
my plan that's my plan

281
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,029
but I bet you I go in there and they're

282
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,329
still missing stuff from NFL fever and

283
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:06,899
it fell Bieber on a sports magnet 2008

284
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,470
of 2009 2k he they just put in the

285
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,709
broadcast sucks the presentation sucks

286
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,360
of the game it's like look at these

287
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,310
fancy things with plenty of screen

288
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,649
tearing but that's all you get every

289
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,959
year they never actually put time and

290
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,990
effort into the presentation okay so oh

291
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,269
oh cool we get some fireworks in the

292
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,339
stadium looks great this part looks good

293
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,829
but then when you start to realize all

294
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,720
the different actual scenes it's the

295
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,930
same freaking scene wait over and over

296
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,790
it's one second each

297
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,829
it doesn't immerse you it doesn't give

298
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,930
you good presentation they do this year

299
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,029
after year after year and then what

300
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,949
you'll see here is the same camera

301
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,190
angles just with the different team

302
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,899
colors and team stadiums they don't even

303
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,990
bother doing like a set of 32 different

304
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,470
animations or or 56 animations so you're

305
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,300
seeing something new every time you're

306
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,829
seeing something interesting every time

307
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,990
now look over here player ratings I know

308
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,300
what my player ratings are I'm playing

309
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,600
franchise whatever happened to showing

310
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,139
matchups and interesting stats and stuff

311
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,639
you know like they do on television

312
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,949
broadcasting oh my god ladies and watch

313
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,860
out for right exactly like we throw

314
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,110
primarily to the right side and we win

315
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,810
75% of our games if we score before the

316
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,149
half you know stuff like that shit but

317
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:29,759
no it's the same thing and then you

318
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,529
notice you can't do it still got that

319
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,120
stupid can't do the instant replay

320
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,880
unless you wait in five minutes I mean

321
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,100
what engine are you using that was like

322
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,930
that before frostbites like that after

323
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,209
frostbite what is wrong with your engine

324
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:46,410
and look at this half time 14 years ago

325
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,889
espn2 k5 had Chris Berman showing you

326
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,959
all the really awesome highlights that

327
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,880
you can rub and your friends faces and

328
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,130
you can just have fun with here is the

329
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,900
halftime show listen

330
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:36,560
we're standing by regular-season games

331
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,060
so they'll talk about scores that are in

332
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,590
the real NFL but they won't talk about

333
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:47,940
yours why is it short why is it a short

334
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,280
version why did you show absolutely

335
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,620
nothing here's the highlight of our game

336
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,320
only played once and at the end of the

337
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,600
game it wasn't even a touchdown there

338
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,010
were two touchdowns in the game you

339
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,330
didn't even show the touchdown the

340
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,890
fucking eye light system is broken

341
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,339
nothing happens at high and halftime the

342
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,350
presentation sucks and that's because

343
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,330
all of the fucking money is going into

344
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,060
the mutt mode period these stupid

345
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,120
fucking cards this is like a mobile game

346
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,980
man with how much money they generate

347
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,260
from this shit this is what they really

348
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,680
care about I cannot believe we let

349
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,980
Madden and EA get away with the shit in

350
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,320
sports and nowhere else and they try

351
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,160
pulling that shit with battlefront too

352
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,160
and I bet you as an anthem to a greater

353
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,200
degree before the battlefront two blew

354
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,420
up in their face and I don't understand

355
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,570
why these outlets continue to let them

356
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,020
get away with it our gaming press who

357
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,120
are supposed to you know protect us from

358
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,120
this stuff or at least inform us at

359
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,230
least inform us seems largely untouched

360
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,880
this largely untouched is largely

361
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,760
untouched 8.9 9.0 on

362
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,530
fortunately the second half of the thing

363
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,970
feels forged in cliche 9.0 in complete

364
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,800
transparency I'm not a frequent visitor

365
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,920
to the ultimate team why you reviewing

366
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,170
the game you need to tell me how much

367
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,210
packs cost and then you'll realize what

368
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,940
the what the hell is going on here why

369
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,950
that's why there's so much emphasis on

370
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,470
this mode 8.9 why is man only get an 800

371
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,170
the dialog options in long shot

372
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,630
really and where is the breakdown our

373
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,380
sports RN our NFL our soccer our

374
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,010
American football Eric they've

375
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,930
completely fallen to the dark side and

376
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,360
people have been putting up with this

377
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,750
yearly roster update these bare minimum

378
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,910
changes have changed the Frostbite

379
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,140
engine we're supposed to be some

380
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,710
revolutionary thing it's like this kind

381
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,290
of improvement and then oh this year's

382
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,850
manon is so much better because of

383
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,270
realistic movements and and we were

384
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,190
looking through these reviews because I

385
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,860
refuse to buy Madden we are looking

386
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,570
through these reviews is it now safe to

387
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,220
buy Madden and I'm so goddamn

388
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,890
disappointing and these reviewers that

389
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,020
aren't telling it like it is but I bet

390
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,940
you if I go on YouTube they'll tell you

391
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,830
like it is or I bet you if I go to the

392
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,900
community they'll tell it like it is I

393
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,850
bet you anything I mean I'm gonna go

394
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,140
there right now see how does this happen

395
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,090
critics 82 user score 5.7 yeah that's

396
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,040
where that is the reality of the

397
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,410
situation that is what the fans really

398
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,910
think 5.1 we go over to the Xbox version

399
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,100
6.4 man them Xbox boys heat it up it

400
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,400
only takes it only takes yeah it only

401
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,360
takes down everybody sucking this up to

402
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,730
not make any amount of change it's

403
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,880
missing so many points and when you see

404
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,680
how much money is made from this

405
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,150
franchise you're like how can they not

406
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,150
affect that user score by now how can

407
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,590

411
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,130
development team to supplement the

412
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,480
Tiburon team because they make so much

413
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,050
money and will put you know and and and

414
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,179
