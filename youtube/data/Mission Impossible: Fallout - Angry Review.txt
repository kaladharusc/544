2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,650
hey guys welcome we just got back from

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,250
seeing Mission Impossible fallout which

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,310
i think is like six the sixth in the

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,380
series that's a lot it's a lot

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,990
considering like I don't remember almost

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,660
anything I do remember those motorcycles

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,520
and them jumping and slamming into each

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,980
other you know Ben Stiller did that Mary

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,220
this just got a hold up so I guess what

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,480
can I say

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,270
did you guys enjoy the film I really did

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,580
it was very enjoyable all right hell

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,180
yeah

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,070
cuz I'm gonna say that right at the

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,150
beginning of the roof this is no

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,680
spoilers if you want spoilers stick

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,930
around to the end but this is a film you

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,400
need to go out and see okay

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,820
action-packed it is action-packed you

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,250
you could tell Tom Cruise's working his

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,430
ass off he really goes above and beyond

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,100
for this series he broke his leg what he

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,110
broke his leg jumping with Wayne they

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,400
kept at it I think they kept it in two

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,540
like he jumps from a building to another

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,650
building and then when he's getting up

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,939
you can see him limping like he broke

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,250
his leg right when he like holds on to

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,740
the side and he's like wow that's kind

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,240
of weird but but then he's full

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,250
sprinting after that eight weeks when

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,370
this motherfucker weeks later when this

34
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,740
but his recovery must have been amazing

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,600
oh yeah where did this for a high before

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,210
I couldn't I cannot run that fast

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,180
Joe can't run that fast Alex can't run

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,430
that fast and this leg day that's leg

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,260
day I'm done

40
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,680
jelly this guy is twice our age and he

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,670
just continues to impress doing all of

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,560
his own stunts and that really benefits

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,110
the film here you have amazing action

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,180
sequences I have to point out the action

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,680
sequence in the bathroom what did you

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,460
guys think about that

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,510
it's definitely the highlight of the

48
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,930
film what definitely not not like that -

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,030
here's the bathroom scene and also the

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,299
house seems like every fighting was spot

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,930
on his way very exactly the director was

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,700
the same director that did rogue nation

53
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,700
a lot of the storylines from rogue

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,129
nation carry into this film so I was a

55
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:16,400
bit lost on specific names

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,610
and maybe syndicate cells that are being

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,620
continued from the first but I would say

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,540
that it you don't really need to have

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,640
seen the other five in fact you don't

60
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,709
need to see any of the other four the

61
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,650
the fifth one rogue nation will help you

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,569
a little bit I remember almost nothing

63
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,549
about any other Mission Impossible movie

64
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:35,870
other than I kind of liked all of them

65
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,920
like they're all pretty good actually

66
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,200
seen along so I and I don't remember

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,819
anything about him so I was I was in

68
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,920
loss at all it will thoroughly satisfy

69
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,909
you newcomer Henry Cavill who is of

70
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,010
course amazing in my favor yeah the

71
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,170
mustache is talking about that was it

72
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,810
worth ruining Justice League that Dobie

73
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,329
was already rich and I'm not just

74
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,890
kidding right they didn't have to do

75
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,629
that they could've gave him a beer they

76
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,129
could have gave him a mustache hey

77
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,690
Superman within my sense it's happened

78
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,319
before but no seriously uh he was a

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,989
badass in the film starts off as sort of

80
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,560
an CIA agent assassin yeah another thing

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,659
he's the strong arm of a particular

82
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,299
division hammer version ham Tom Cruise's

83
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,000
over scalpel yes and that was really

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
good in the film that they had their own

85
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,569
styles yes

86
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,280
that was cool and you could tell like

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,859
one uses tech obviously you have the

88
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,810
tech and then Henry Cavill picks up okay

89
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,510
so this is brute force so it worked out

90
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,419
really really well um the only way what

91
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,010
do you think weakness is we're obviously

92
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,780
praising this film you didn't go out and

93
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,690
see it in theaters it is a fun wild ride

94
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,349
with eggs but to me it kind of dipped

95
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,389
because it felt long there's twenty

96
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,769
eight hours here's a long where's the

97
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,030
horn nitpicking right so we're

98
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,280
nitpicking it was too long hard for me

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,329
yet have been trimmed down there was I

100
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,310
got wearing it wasn't dragging like

101
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,930
specific there was a specific are

102
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,879
because there's a specific arc that felt

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,099
kind of unnecessary kind of was shoved

104
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,260
in there that we didn't really need okay

105
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,579
so there are you talking about the

106
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:10,970
broker

107
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,650
yeah the broker and yeah it was kind of

108
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,150
unnecessary there's this blonde

109
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,940
character of the white widow who is a

110
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,220
broker of this information because these

111
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,959
nuclear weapons have been stolen and

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,760
that's another thing about this you

113
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,860
would think oh come on Joe not new to

114
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,140
their weapons but no this one

115
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,850
really

116
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,670
Vince's you and engages you in the film

117
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,980
the entire time the film isn't

118
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,590
interested in social commentary it's not

119
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,840
interested in politics it's not pushing

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,150
an agenda in your face or even behind

121
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,650
the background this is a straight-up

122
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,130
action film with all the tropes of

123
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,320
Mission Impossible like those seconds

124
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,100
ticking down it's complicated for no

125
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,290
reason

126
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,510
like saving it in time but the tension

127
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,430
is still there damn should still date

128
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,950
after six films right and so that's why

129
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,270
we're so surprised

130
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,820
is that how can it still engage us like

131
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,860
this when it's using these tropes and oh

132
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,140
he's not a pilot but he's piloting this

133
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,510
this helicopter the battle is that rages

134
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,600
look cool no dumb oh it was really cool

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,640
and I enjoyed it but watching is like

136
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,840
this is so stupid

137
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,020
this helicopter I did was stupid but for

138
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,510
me stupid in a good way because he's

139
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,610
literally trying to ram him you know the

140
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,750
he's good the helicopter out of the sky

141
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,830
there's a yeah there's like a helicopter

142
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,780
sequence in the Himalayas and they're

143
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,940
like chasing each other and so he

144
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,320
doesn't know how to fly a helicopter but

145
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,690
he's also like the best helicopter but

146
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,850
saying but it gives the director and

147
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,800
action choreographed for the opportunity

148
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,960
to use really unique shots and none of

149
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,270
it looks CGI I mean this dude is

150
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,940
literally pulling himself up a rope and

151
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,740
and the way they put the camera in

152
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,570
certain areas you can tell wow this shit

153
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,000
is real of course a lot of practical

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,640
effects in movie magic but it's worth

155
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,070
going alone for the bathroom fight scene

156
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,560
which is perhaps one of the most fastest

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,650
and well choreographed scenes and sure

158
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,140
it was way it was the holy was it was

159
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,490
good it was really good and it wasn't

160
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,140
this is not what a moron

161
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,210
Jean lark is his name which I thought

162
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,210
was maybe a play on John wick cuz he's

163
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,400
as good as John wick is cuz he's beating

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,730
up both even most bad henry cavill

165
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,520
characters so i'm like holy crap alright

166
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,410
guys but let's get right down to brass

167
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,690
tacks were super satisfied with the

168
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,710
action the effects the stunts

169
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,020
even the story even though it's kind of

170
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,520
standard fare

171
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,770
what and supporting characters what

172
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,480
about his team

173
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,940
good I mean I I felt there was parts of

174
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,800
the movie where I they were kind of

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,930
missing and but they were really

176
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,400
impactful when they were there yes oh

177
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,470
yeah and I think that they involved this

178
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,910
team well enough at least in my opinion

179
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,190
they're always there when he needs him

180
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,460
last minute kind of moments they are in

181
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,750
their spot on the team though they've

182
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,330
done that several movies ago and it's

183
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,940
just more of the good stuff more of the

184
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,160
good a character appears from the

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,020
previous film rogue nation that sort of

186
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,330
kind of integrates themselves into the

187
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,580
storyline and it and is moving along

188
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,290
with the team and I think she does a

189
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,140
great job this is Elsa whatever she's

190
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,900
fantastic character and it goes a little

191
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,750
bit into Ethan hunts sort of backstory

192
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,430
and what makes them tick and and how do

193
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,160
you get to Ethan in order to sort of

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,500
ramp up the intrigue in the film I think

195
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,690
it works all right so let's go final

196
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,140
verdicts

197
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,710
Johanna verdict I'm gonna give this an

198
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,980
eight out of ten Oh an egg you know why

199
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,190
not a nine because in the middle it kind

200
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,530
of dragged down for me like it was like

201
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,840
unnecessary yeah but throughout the

202
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,970
whole thing it was amazing shots of the

203
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,970
chase scenes the fighting scenes the

204
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,420
helicopter was amazing there's training

205
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,210
he trained so hard he became a pilot

206
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,500
right but at the end of the day it's

207
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,960
like the other ones it was a great ride

208
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,670
but you're gonna forget about it yeah

209
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,350
the bathroom scene we'll remember that

210
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,890
but remember the big in the middle and

211
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,750
yeah we recorded this review already and

212
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,300
III had forgotten to mention the the

213
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,790
police the sort of it gives you a

214
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,560
feeling of call of duty the Russian

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,480
level in the airport for those gamers

216
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,650
out there that know what I'm talking

217
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,970
about they got something like that in

218
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,560
there they even have a beautiful

219
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,320
underwater shot where he tries to find a

220
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,330
creative way to basically capture this

221
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,830
head of the syndicate that's a very

222
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,630
dangerous person from the rogue nation

223
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,490
film and he finds a really creative way

224
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,540
to do it

225
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,850
but what about you Alex what would you

226
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,800
oh yeah I think this is innate I think

227
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,420
it's a really solid eight it's like

228
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,029
super enjoyable but this this is nowhere

229
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,680
near a legendary film like my dear if

230
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,180
you'll remember every detail you want to

231
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,399
watch again that's a ten yeah so this is

232
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,290
candy yeah that yes but this is nowhere

233
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,300
near that I'll like this isn't a movie

234
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,350
where you're like hey you wanna go see

235
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,430
this tomorrow it's like no I think this

236
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,170
was really good to see once you want to

237
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,670
see at the movie weekend or maybe like

238
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,839
within a couple first couple weeks it

239
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,579
comes out and it's a definite it was

240
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:16,839
like entertaining all the way through it

241
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,759
was a little too long it did dragging a

242
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,290
little a little bit and it a little

243
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,500
because it's a spy thriller they kind of

244
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,240
made the movie tells you who the bad guy

245
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,850
is really early in and so they try to do

246
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,290
a little twist and turn but yeah but

247
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,509
they weren't they weren't like really

248
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,220
good they're really good you could still

249
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,589
predict who was the villain it was a

250
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,440
very maybe yeah I guess so like what

251
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,470
it's very obvious yeah get a mustache

252
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,199
like yeah so likes for us damn it is

253
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,500
this a spoiler in the trailer in the

254
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,130
trailer you know so for us like sixes

255
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,810
and sevens are above average like a

256
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,579
takes a good film it's a really solid

257
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,980
film ninth excellent and I don't think

258
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,310
this hits excellent like it is it's I

259
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,019
want to give it so my final verse so

260
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,300
that's an 8 out of 10 in editin I want

261
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,490
to give it a not and on the initial

262
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,870
recording I gave it a 9 here's the

263
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,610
reason why I went one point above

264
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,069
because of all of the effort that Tom

265
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,620
Cruise puts into this role the practical

266
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,199
effects the stunts are all real and this

267
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,269
dude is old and he's still chugging

268
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,339
along and he makes it feel like rogue

269
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,000
nation and now fallout is the prime of

270
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,310
Mission Impossible shoes and this thing

271
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,949
has been out for two decades when he was

272
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,420
a little kid man

273
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,069
have you seen little Mission Impossible

274
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:41,709
one looks like yeah he looks like a Joe

275
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,000
it's crazy

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,769
he's coming fresh often like risky

277
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,920
business or some shit like that Joe yeah

278
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,949
no it is that old look it up it's well

279
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,810
okay maybe a few years after that but

280
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,870
still it has been like 20 years I think

281
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,350
oh my gosh but ok so but to still be in

282
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,709
that kind of prime and cranking out

283
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,920
consistently good films III wanted to

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,350
give it that credit but over time since

285
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,180
we've had a day or two to think about it

286
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,430
remember our reviews are literally 15

287
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,529
minutes after watching the film so we

288
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,029
have a kind of a different review style

289
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,209
but sleeping on it I do agree with you

290
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,100
guys it's an 8 out of 10

291
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,040
why because you're not gonna remember

292
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,250
all the plot points it is derivative in

293
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,360
many many ways

294
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,519
but here's the thing that's not a bad

295
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,680
thing because you don't care that it's

296
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,660
derivative you don't care that it uses

297
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,550
oh we got to cut the wires in the bum

298
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,130
and this man it the same things that

299
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,870
we've seen over and over because it's so

300
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,360
well executed but because of that and

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,010
because you'll forget much some of the

302
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,709
major plot lines it does end up at an 8

303
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,800
out of 10 these guys are right yet again

304
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,269
for good Tom Cruise is Mission

305
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,360
Impossible fall out which is it's

306
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,279
interesting because did you see Bethesda

307
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,689
tweet and Tom Cruise

308
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,059
where they were like a man Tom Cruise we

309
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,550
really loved your film oblivion and now

310
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,220
we love your film fallout call us we'll

311
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,199
give you a head start on the next one

312
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,380
cuz Tom Cruise is making films with the

313
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:21,069
titles from Ojai gosh but I'm freaking

314
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,130
out and I think it's really cool so his

315
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:35,829
next film is gonna be what oh you know

316
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,689
why this movie can't be a nine right why

317
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,819
because his arms don't make the noise Oh

318
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,410

section where we you know basically get

325

into the nitty-gritty so Henry Cavill

326
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,070

327
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,540

329
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,250
family why there's a phone scene where

330
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,260
you see that the bad guys phone is

331
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,120
broken but when Henry Cavill turns in

332
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,620
he's like this is the evidence that

333
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,450
either broke either Ethan Hunt is the

334
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,430
bad guy to face down

335
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,520
alright but then they show you clearly

336
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,490
show you the screen ok it happens right

337
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,950
away so you know from the very beginning

338
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,320
that he's the bad guy but very twist

339
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
later on the trailer it looks like

340
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,070
Henry's fighting Tom Cruise yeah so they

341
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,020
do this thing where as this John large

342
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,810
person is is obviously a good guy and

343
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,820
he's a mole and he says actually a

344
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,920
syndicate operative which the syndicate

345
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,840
are the bad guys and the leader of the

346
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,990
syndicate is who this plot line centers

347
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,230
around where he has managed to obtain

348
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,480
three nuclear weapons and there he's

349
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,850
gonna set them all off and the syndicate

350
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,020
is serious business because they've

351
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,590
already set off in aids in Ventura

352
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:19,140
smallpox epidemic in Pakistan and China

353
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,180
cares man yeah and so they're like okay

354
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,560
these guys are serious they're gonna do

355
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,820
something about it so that's when the

356
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,380
broker character comes in that she

357
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,870
really had no purpose I don't know why

358
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,540
she was there is she a famous actress or

359
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,250
a famous singer because she didn't

360
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,990
really look like somebody I recognized

361
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,300
but maybe she's like a European pop star

362
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,460
I don't know but we were confused as to

363
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,780
why she was in there because she doesn't

364
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,990
really factor into the plot much this is

365
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,290
an awkwardly yeah it's a weird but

366
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,210
ultimately none of that mattered because

367
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,240
her and her brother were trying to also

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,460
creepy mustache creepy mustache and

369
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,830
another very basically break the guy out

370
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,510
that's when Tom Cruise comes up with a

371
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,630
creative idea to instead trap the police

372
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,510
escort and gun every good guy down which

373
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,220
is what would have happened in this sort

374
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,170
of dream sequence where Tom Cruise you

375
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,150
think Tom Cruise has to actually execute

376
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,540
a police officer how many people in this

377
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,170
this movie and but he's like I draw the

378
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,510
here that was well done and you know it

379
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,930
he kills bad guys and it was touching

380
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,630
that he wouldn't let good people die so

381
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,340
it's Tom Cruise's fault

382
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,110
this whole film happened because he

383
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,460
didn't want to let one of his team

384
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,810
members divert what's his name Luther

385
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,160
yeah so Luther gets caught and he's like

386
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,630
it's either Luther or the nuclear device

387
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,180
any other agent and this is pointed out

388
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,410
in the film would have just killed

389
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,500
Luther and and that and saved the

390
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,480
nuclear device from me did you guys find

391
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,430
the Alec Baldwin pep talk a little

392
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,830
cheesy yeah I think he was right it was

393
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,690
a little cheesy it was nice but it just

394
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,400
he went a little too far he's like this

395
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,990
is the reason why I love you and I trust

396
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,610
you because you care about the one line

397
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,380
who's gonna turn into a villain yes he

398
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,810
was like monolatry somebody you think

399
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,490
it's because they were like oh shit he's

400
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,960
in it but he's not really what you need

401
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,670
to find something well paying him the

402
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,620
Alec Baldwin salary gotta get me out of

403
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,270
you know something and that's a shitty

404
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,640
part that I didn't like they killed off

405
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,920
Alec Baldwin for seemingly no reason

406
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,260
Henry Cavill once he's revealed to be a

407
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,110
bad guy well here's the mask that masks

408
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,670
effectively that's been in the film

409
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,440
since like the first or the second one

410
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
looks really those kinds of props

411
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,630
oh those masks are amazing those guy

412
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,100
that makes them I mean they look at

413
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,430
you're not seeing this hyperreal they

414
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,500
are oversized like Trump and Putin ya

415
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,150
ever seen that one but if they make them

416
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,240
smaller they look really realistic and I

417
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
so the trick henry cavill the revealing

418
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,400
he's actually the the unknown operative

419
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,680
bit reverse scooby-doo him reverse

420
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,870
scooby-doo him and then and then they're

421
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,130
like and it's a what's the guy's name

422
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,670
simon Pegg's character so they do that

423
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,810
they find these nuclear devices at in

424
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,000
the same location as Ethan hunts wife

425
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,030
because this guy is mad obsessed with

426
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,589
destroying not only the loved you know

427
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,010
the world so that the world can restart

428
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,380
after great suffering comes great peace

429
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,030
he thinks if he fires off these nukes

430
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,829
he'll bring down the world governments

431
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,020
which makes no sense but whatever but he

432
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,000
also wants to kill Tom Cruise's wife and

433
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,079
that's kind of some of the dream

434
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,990
sequences tom has it was afraid

435
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,840
and so they eventually get to the area

436
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,220
with his wife and he has to like play

437
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,139
dumb like he doesn't know his wife and

438
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,629
her new husband's like hey baby silly

439
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:40,600
happy-go-lucky and you know it's kind of

440
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,639
a creepy and not a creepy scene but just

441
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:46,149
a weird scene that he has to you know

442
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,590
hold back his feelings because he can't

443
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,570
be with her no more he is now having

444
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,720
feelings with they look the same

445
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,549
any other do they do look the same you

446
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:00,419
do a picture or something yeah you joke

447
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,220
they show a picture and the two girls

448
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,749
side by side to look very similar but in

449
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,499
the film they don't look that simulating

450
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:11,590
and so you know they all go there to set

451
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,090
these nuclear devices off and they only

452
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,080
have 15 minutes now this one camera yeah

453
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,119
this one cannot be cut unless this other

454
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,100
one cut is at the same time plus the

455
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,950
failsafe trigger has to be outside of

456
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,440
the the piece and they were like this is

457
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,809
the most secure bomb system once it

458
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,509
starts it never stops but then they find

459
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,340
a way to make it stop oh yeah that

460
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,080
wouldn't be a movie nyan right I know I

461
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,340
think so but it's really still to

462
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,820
tension-filled because what because oh

463
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,179
yeah well the copter seemed and he

464
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:47,289
doesn't know how to fly a helicopter

465
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,279
he's a make a boy chase them how did I

466
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,960
guess when I have Kallen copter he's

467
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,399
gonna chase him down and I'll figure out

468
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,860
where the helicopter is like oh you and

469
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,519
a helicopter

470
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,309
yeah I'll figure it out that's that's

471
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,779
that's the tagline in the movie I'll go

472
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,240
figure it out and he figures it out

473
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,740
everything good time but the problem is

474
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,509
isn't it I think we lost Alex there

475
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:10,869
here's make groaning noises when this

476
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,340
was trying to ram the other helicopter

477
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,769
they made a point like they specifically

478
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,749
had dialogue in the movie that says wait

479
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:18,340
he's in hell copper he doesn't know how

480
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,379
to fly a helicopter all they had to do

481
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,059
is just have him get in and start flying

482
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:23,830
a big Oh Ethan I could fly helicopters I

483
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,909
think that makes sense she's a badass

484
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:28,210
like that was the one time but script

485
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,429
doctor missed something he gets in and

486
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:31,600
he's like wobbling around he doesn't

487
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,100
know what he's doing and within 30

488
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,929
seconds he is in the Himalayas going

489
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,609
over mountain tops like your clouds and

490
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,440
he's dive-bombing and when the drivers

491
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,540
truck maneuver

492
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,930
what the hell is a pilot without wit

493
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,430
with the helicopter that's already been

494
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,590
shot out because Henry is shooting at

495
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,450
him the whole time with a fucking 50 Cal

496
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,540
machine gunner no I think it was a some

497
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,550
big some big-ass gun let me a law or

498
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,960
something I don't know but it just

499
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,000
peppering him and his helicopters on

500
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,920
fire but still as manages to be faster

501
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,690
than the other one I killed an innocent

502
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,360
pilot bat fuck him Joe they were bad

503
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,590
guys anyway you don't know that he's

504
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,060
crew that they were over there heroes

505
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,230
killing innocent no no that's not true

506
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,240
because remember the pilots do try to

507
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,310
shoot him and then no okay so they're

508
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,900
all not from the other no they make

509
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,110
their did he didn't be ugh the one that

510
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,520
he commandeered there was nobody in it

511
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,960
with him so if somebody jumps into your

512
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,540
car would you try to shoot him so you're

513
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,610
saying that you're a bad dad good guys

514
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,050
the Peace Corps have guns

515
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,670
yes I don't think when you're in Kashmir

516
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,350
you got to go high so yeah and and

517
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,880
although these and then the helicopter

518
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,310
crashes and it spins and everybody is

519
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:52,410
still in Malaga and it's rolling at 300

520
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,560
miles an hour down a Himalayans hillside

521
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,780
not calling an avalanche but whatever

522
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,520
and then it hangs there and then they

523
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,530
have this epic fight right before he

524
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,570
tries to pull the trigger while another

525
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,520
fight scene is going on with the main

526
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,350
villain two really good boys and his

527
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,720
girlfriend is she's an agent and mi6

528
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,940
agent is she's beating them up and Simon

529
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,590
Pegg is being choked and killed at the

530
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,770
same time cuz he's not a good attention

531
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,690
he's not good at close combat but she is

532
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,190
and they both have to team up to fight

533
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,990
alright then finally like cut the wires

534
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,510
and it's great and that's why it's funny

535
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,890
though cuz like he's tied up he's

536
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,180
looking at the bomber he's like you

537
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,610
cannot disarrayed ah he's all happy

538
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,290
because like you can't yeah and he's

539
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,940
still alive by the end of the film and

540
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,510
then at the antes around me you fuck

541
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,280
thank you hey we suffer gonna mentioned

542
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,810
that Superman becomes two-face yes cool

543
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,290
spawning scene at the cliff who spoke

544
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,900
about the ramifications of of everything

545
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,980
flipping is a little

546
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,159
so oil lying yeah sprayed right in

547
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,990
Henry's face it melts his face it's real

548
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,720
and I I liked that because it kind of

549
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,220
shows cuz Henry might be a better

550
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,169
fighter than Ethan they never really

551
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,539
proved that their burger or both pretty

552
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,389
II even know no they will pass hey John

553
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:09,120
wick who kicked their ass sir John lark

554
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,860
kick their ass

555
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,720
but that way they show that you know

556
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,419
he's a little bit lessened and Ethan can

557
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:22,970
overcome him in the way that he did so

558
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,380
yeah alright well I thought you were

559
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,500
gonna go with the mustache something off

560
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,490
his mustache I did they remove it at the

561
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,230
very end just as like a final we could

562
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,659
have got rid of it but we didn't want

563
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,970
but but whatever it turned out to be

564
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,679
great at didn't the mustache did

565
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,870
separate him from his other roles and

566
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,059
make him you know look pretty rugged and

567
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,470
badass so whatever guys it was Justice

568
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,669
League's fault for that fucking mustache

569
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:58,289
thing I will never forgive it I will

570
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,559
never forgive WB and Zack Snyder and

571
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,480
Josh Whedon that they didn't just let me

572
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,700
be Humana because and we're talking

573
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,870
about Justice League this is mission

574
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,269
impossible call out we're done with the

575
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:11,460
fucking spoilers area unless you

576
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,399
motherfuckers can think of anything no

577
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,019
it's probably best not to think about

578
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,460
this movie too much because it'll just

579
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,610
get worse no it was good and no but it's

580
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,350
a spy movie one thing that you pointed

581
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,659
out was one of the and the reason why we

582
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,460
pointed it out is because the film does

583
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,190
a good job of addressing things like

584
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,740
wait that's not all okay oh wait no no

585
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,750
all I see you see but then this one was

586
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,490
wait why don't you just say he's a

587
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,460
fucking pilot I mean it's fine yeah but

588
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,350
they were trying to create fake tension

589
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,210
like all Kenny really pilot it but they

590
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,409
didn't need that because the scene

591
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,690
already has two Abella copters doing

592
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,700
tricks slamming into each other trying

593
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,139
to ram each other out of the sky with a

594
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,299
fucking 50 Cal shooting and all many

595
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,100
ways it was great anyways go out and see

596
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,539
