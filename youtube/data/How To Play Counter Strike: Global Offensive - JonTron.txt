play Counter Strike global Offensive now

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,309
the first thing you want to do is you

5
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:14,170
want to get one of these pistols here uh

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,320

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,960
don't know what the hell that's doing

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,230
here

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,609
as you can see wearing some sort of

13
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,910
person's house which oh you thought you

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,349

rule don't let no let him get to you

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,019
just don't let him get here and this is

22
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,610
a ploy right there what you're seeing

23
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,500
that is a ploy so you want to make sure

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,760
you're playing this is realistically as

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
possible so just imagine you were in

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,449
this situation in real life and you will

27
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,909
