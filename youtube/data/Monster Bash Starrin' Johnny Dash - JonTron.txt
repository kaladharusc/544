1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,730
now this is the story all about how on

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,130
up in my rig to SLI but then

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,350
accidentally burn to my processor and

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:21,609
I'll holy videos a couple days way I

5
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,039
really fits a big one again so just

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,410
pretend it's Halloween you douchebags

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:43,280
[Music]

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:01:07,680
jontron I think that somebody might have

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,590
a compass might put some things it was a

10
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,590
little candle okay I think cementum

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,149
everything in a bath but we have more

12
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,190
important things to cover for it's the

13
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,600
month of the haunted

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,540
the days of the dam the weeks but a

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,100
pumpkin Halloween baby I'm just

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,770
something loved when Halloween rolls

17
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,200
around you can just feel it I love it

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,460
it's the beginning of the holiday season

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,259
and I'd be hard-pressed to not

20
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,940
appreciate it every time it comes around

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,920
you just you just feeling like I'm a win

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,020
like a Swiss come on detectives I got oh

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,350
you know it's feeling magic it's a

24
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,259
special time of year time for a special

25
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,060
time of game kind of game Buchan monster

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,580
bash an Apogee classic ran on the DOS

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,289
operating system is generally pretty

28
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,119
rare to find in this condition this

29
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,099
crappy little CD right here commands

30
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,289
some pretty outrageous prices online in

31
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,280
hell there aren't even that many of them

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,690
to begin with so I think it's safe to

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,090
say it's generally a rare little gem I'm

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,670
pretty lucky

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,060
ah Apogee just the name brings back

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,340
memories pretty early memories - Apogee

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,200
might very well be the first video game

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,940
company I came to know you can think of

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,190
the days of ms-dos the Wild West of the

40
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,200
video game industry anything was free

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,730
game technologies were imperfect

42
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,040
sometimes even horrible games were all

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,530
over the place no genre was safe he had

44
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,480
kids games violent games puzzle games

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
and weird fucking games

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,150
[Music]

47
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,920
it was seriously a mess but for a kid in

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,630
the 90s well it was some sort of hidden

49
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,220
playground I don't know how to describe

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,290
the appeal to a young mind but it wasn't

51
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,180
like it is now nowadays you can go to

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,830
local 7-eleven and pick up the most

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,660
advanced version of Street Fighter 4 but

54
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,580
back then it was a much different story

55
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,570
being told out of a book imagine all you

56
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,670
had was yourself no money and a computer

57
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,710
that looked like this yeah look and this

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,530
scene walruses look better than this

59
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,060
core that's not correct to say he had to

60
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,740
type weird confusing commands just to

61
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,510
get the game running and that was if you

62
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,860
got the game running there weren't many

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,720
standards back then and let's just say

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,450
it wasn't fun when you did get it right

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,950
when the stars aligned in your favor

66
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,300
will you suddenly unlock the world

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,440
beyond your wildest dreams and

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,700
imagination that you were free to frolic

69
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,730
in and explore that is until it crashed

70
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,160
or something yeah and at the very top of

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,930
this industry sat companies like Sierra

72
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,090
in Apogee software sure there were other

73
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,770
developers and publishers out there who

74
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,120
can compete with names like Duke Nukem

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,250
Commander Keen Wolfenstein 3ds rap to

76
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,390
call the shadows King's Quest and

77
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,310
Leisure Suit Larry well maybe that

78
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,020
doesn't sound like much now but I assure

79
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,610
you back then it was the cream of the

80
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,800
crop nowadays Apogee is known as 3d

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,080
realms and we all know how that wins

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,300
today we're talking about the Golden Age

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,000
right now this game almost came to me is

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,860
it my chance a passing game out there

85
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,390
somewhere in the world landed in the

86
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,550
hands of a starry-eyed child waiting for

87
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,450
adventure and it meant more back then to

88
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,959
old friend

89
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,480
let's pop you in over some fine dining

90
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,260
and booze ketchup shop don't forget to

91
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,500
be careful with your air games come on

92
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,650
he's get in there we got play I hope it

93
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,900
doesn't run you get any pizza in there

94
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,900
mm I mean something smells good no wait

95
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,270
that's just the reminder that I'm stuck

96
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,490
with you for the rest of my cyborg life

97
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,620
all right let's just try to boot this

98
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,510
decrepit old game up time for those

99
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,520
obsolete skills to come back to me baby

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,310
yo I once spent like 230 hours trying to

101
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,050
get King's Quest 5 to work to this ship

102
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,969
well

103
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:41,909
should be a breeze okay so we're on Z

104
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,849
here oh okay C doesn't exist except it

105
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,539
does okay mount CC : / DOSBox okay good

106
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,369
let's change directory to see right

107
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,259
making progress here change directory to

108
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,330
DOSBox okay apparently I'm going to jail

109
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,319
practice is illegal

110
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,129
oh okay uh change directly task box nah

111
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,619
yeah that's a sin I'm stuck let me just

112
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:02,699
type some random things maybe they'll

113
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,159
work okay baby we're in directory bash

114
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,539
now just to get this son of a bitch

115
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,039
running let's type the magic word bash 1

116
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,349
yeah that's right you type bash one to

117
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,689
start the game ms-dos ladies and

118
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:24,010
gentlemen

119
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,010
monster bash starring Johnny - more like

120
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,690
what they call it this I always thought

121
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,310
the intro theme to this game was just

122
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,380
jazzing so let's begin the game

123
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,170
oh Jesus a lot of freakin options wait

124
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,690
was that ordering invoke this ordering

125
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,050
info in the game as new one ordered by

126
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,470
tax machine yeah just imagine that the

127
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,770
past man times were rough yeah yeah okay

128
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,300
is a story who cares about zombies

129
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,740
inside let's let's get in there stop

130
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,510
blasting already Oh was that Monster

131
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,660
Mash hitbox to exit level free all the

132
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,660
dogs and cats hitbox huh more like

133
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,580
necessary to complete the game box

134
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,440
seriously no now seriously thank you mom

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,690
who gives a shit oh yeah

136
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,610
bad connection baby and this is truly

137
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,840
one of the very first games I ever

138
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
played and I remember that it all felt

139
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,410
very real to me at the time perhaps

140
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,720
these roots are what put me where I am

141
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,180
today who knows I'm not I'm not even I'm

142
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,160
not even a tree so like that completely

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,290
imperative that you read box says you

144
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,550
got to free all the animals to beat the

145
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,840
level cuz who gives two tits in the

146
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,960
gravy oh just look at that art that dull

147
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,090
colored pixel aesthetic it's a style not

148
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,280
bred by choice but by limitation it's

149
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,630
something really special to me that I

150
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,190
don't think can ever be recreated again

151
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,380
it was truly an air of taking less and

152
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,150
making it more even if a person were to

153
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,710
go back and make a game that calls back

154
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,450
to this Golden Age games which many have

155
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,370
I can never truly regret the field

156
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,930
nowadays we've got everything imaginable

157
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,820
in our hands all the way up to true 3d

158
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,410
gaming but hey every now and then

159
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,850
doesn't hurt to go back and try to

160
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,710
imagine living in a time when this was

161
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,380
the benchmark mmm nothing like a good

162
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,610
kids Halloween gay

163
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,449
oh do Jesus this game is as gory as

164
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,189
Mortal Kombat that was always one of my

165
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,509
favorite parts of this game games

166
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,860
general at the time they certainly

167
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,569
didn't have an established rating system

168
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,949
and it was just kind of free reign from

169
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,419
the outside this game looks like none

170
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,889
important the kids game I mean you're

171
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,139
saving animals to beat the level yeah

172
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,289
hmm what is this everything just blows

173
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,250
up I love it but I guess since it's

174
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,409
zombie door I'm not human gore it's more

175
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,180
forgivable huh does everyone in the MPAA

176
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,629
are a bunch of zombies did anyone see I

177
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,310
just did this let's just go down here oh

178
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,180
great

179
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,949
you got to get hit to go down there oh

180
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,259
yeah one up in Monaghan that is an

181
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,259
awesome looking one up according as um

182
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,169
now what was it doing man maybe Johnny -

183
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,940
should be more worried about his diction

184
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,669
than these zombies yeah so when other

185
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,379
games you open chest to get the items

186
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,449
inside and monster bash though you make

187
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,949
chips in the side of it until if any

188
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,279
falls out then you're done I guess oh

189

walls

192
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,490
I got a know one thing about this game

193
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,110
is it's rather unforgiving

194
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,360
he's pretty frigging hard man look even

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,830
these things only allow you to step on

196
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,509
them once before they break forever oh

197
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,150
