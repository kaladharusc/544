00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello everybody! My name is Markiplier,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,640
And welcome to three weird games

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,260
Now, these games aren't weird because they're so unbelievably out there

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,620
they're weird because their methodology and their utilization

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,180
isn't necessarily what you would find in normal games.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,540
The first game of which, is actually controlled

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,220
By my singing.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,740
So you'll see that soon, but before I get started I wanted to say that

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,760
I am leaving for Amsterdam in two days.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
This Wednesday I'm gonna be heading over to Amsterdam for our shows on Saturday.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,240
So, if you haven't gotten a ticket yet, please check the link subscription below for Amsterdam tickets

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,460
if you're anywhere in the 'nair'-- in the air--

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,140
if you're anywhere in the area of Amsterdam.

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,900
So check that out, thank you everybody for watching!

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,180
and enjoy~

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,780
Okay, so this is &quot;ONE HAND CLAPPING&quot;.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,300
So apparently this game is controlled by your voice.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,760
You...

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,800
(mouth sounds)  bleh bleh bleh bleh

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,920
And sing away and then it does something in the game?

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,720
I'm not a hundred percent sure how accurate that's going to be

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,300
or how well I have to sing...

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,040
if I..

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,760
if it require some sort of accuracy, I don't know if its gonna go too well...
(hah)

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,440
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA! Eh, No?

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,400
Nothing yet?

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,520
Hello?

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
Oh, shi-- aAAAhAHah...

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,540
(weird moan-singing???)

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,720
...All right. I don't know what the hell that was all about

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,080
but that happened...I'm very happy about that?

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,880
Oh?

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,620
What?

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,640
Huh?

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,800
(MARKIPLIER NOISES)

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,560
I can hear myself in the game!

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,060
Oh!

38
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:40,500
(Hits lowest note possible)

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,600
Okay, got that.

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,780
OH!

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,400

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,460

43
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,000

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,100
HEEEEEE~! (High pitched singing noises)

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,020
See?

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,740
You see?

47
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,400
That's what that's about.

48
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,480
La la la la la la la~!

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,860

(High-pitched semi-yodel)

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,540
Sorry, I'm just having fun with this one...

57
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,060
laLAAAAAAAlaola~

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,660
Okay,

59
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,240
All right, so this is the game.

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,660
its pretty- its pretty fascinating!

61
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,420
This, this guy is just gonna go off on all times because it's gonna...

62
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,060
It's gonna...

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,620
It's gonna go off, uhh, just because I was talking all the time.

64
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,100
But anyways, so it's like a little me in here... (Markiplier noises)

65
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:52,280
(Repeated &quot;BLAH&quot; sound)

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,320
(Baby sound)

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm having too much fun with it.

68
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,380
Okay!

69
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,940
Ohh.

70
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,320
Wait.

71
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,940
(Vocalizing)

72
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,880
(More vocalizing)

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:11,780
hiYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
(LOUD VOCALIZING)

74
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,200
(snorting laugh)

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
That's so funny.

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
That's so good.

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,780
That's so good!

78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,660
That's funny!

79
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,140
That's really cool!

80
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,900
That works!

81
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,500
Okay!

82
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,760
All right then.

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,820
Uh oh.

84
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,360
Hey guys..

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,680
(beautiful Italiano vocalization)

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,420
Oh..

87
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,040
What am I supposed to do here?

88
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,480
(Continues &quot;La La La&quot; + Vocalization)

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,540
I wish it was like, you know, like with Bugs Bunny. Like in the orchestra, like...

90
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,880
You raise it higher like..

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,460
HIYAAAAAAAAA!

92
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,260
You know?

93
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,420
But, apparently nothing...

94
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,620
So, I don't know what they're doing about it...

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,840
(Hitting low note)

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,440
Hmm.

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,740
WELL!

98
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,080
I don't know about this..

99
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,860
Heh, just falls in-- AHH.

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,200
All right, I don't know what I'm suppose to do there.

101
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,140
But, we got this moaning crowd in the background and I don't know what that's all about.

102
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,580
So I can't get back,

103
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,320
Oh, I'm stuck already guys..

104
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,720
Apparently I'm absolutely stuck..

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:43,020
aAAAAAYHOOOOOOOOUOOOOAAAAAAAAIIIAIIIIIIII AYAYAYYAYAYYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAY

106
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I don't know what I'm suppose to do here!

107
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,080
Higher pitch?

108
00:04:45,080 --> 00:05:00,920
(Amazingly on-key high vocalization)

109
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,220
This is as high as I can go, I don't know what more..It was doing something!

110
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:29,640
(Whistles)

111
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,260
(Catches breath)

112
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,880
Okay!

113
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,600
All right. That's-- woof.

114
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,780
Okay. I think I need to re-calibrate it, because it seems to be-

115
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,160
(Hits low note)

116
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,760
Okay, that's low..

117
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,360
And now hopefully, it would be not require- oh!

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,980
hey, how's it..

119
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,200
hi-oh.. that's horrifying

120
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,780
ugh! its some wiggle worm gecko going on over there,

121
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:07,660
(Vocalizes low, high, then low notes)

122
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,620
okay!

123
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,180

128
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
tough crowd out here..

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,420
what? you don't like my singing?

130
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,200
HUH?

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,540

132
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,500

(Vocalizes loudly) hAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

134
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,740
Oh, I can stop now?

135
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,360
okay, alright.

136
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,240
this is a great vocal warm up game.

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,540
(giggling) yeah.

138
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,140

139
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,900

140
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,800

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,780
Will I ever see my family again?

146
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,360
Will I ever see?

147
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,980

148
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,460
I'm not singing anymore!

149
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,900
And , I don't know why.

150
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,580

358
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,960
its just a unique concept for a game

359
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,500
(sings)

360
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,020

that's so weird!

367
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,440

378
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,060
(tries over and over for the note)

379
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,420
(laughs)

380
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,160
it so cool cause you can hear yourself

381
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,180
it actually records your voice in the game

382
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,040
(sings)

383
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,960

that's so weird

390
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,180
its like..this is actually trying to teach you how to sing

391
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,720
because, what that was, it was trying to help you find intervals

392
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,500
and that last one

393
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,300
(green creature sings)

394

this game is teaching you how to sing!

398
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,520
that's what its doing, or at least is a rudimentary thing in it, but its teaching you to sing

399
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,420
that's so cool!

400
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,300
(sings)

401
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,300

410
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,240

where was that

636
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,240
*someone new is taking over the subtitles now, yay!!*

637
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,880
*weird sounds*

638
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,240
This is a dead end! *No idea what's going on*

639
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,920
What is this weird house?

640
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,480
What kind of creepy party is this?

641
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,840
What are you people?

642
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,780
Where'd you all come from?

643
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,580
And why am I here and I don't know anybody?

644
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,240
There are so many people in this place

645
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,060
and I still don't know anybody?

646
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,040
Oh God damn it, oh no

647
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,680
Oh! *Inhalation from Markimoo* There! There!

648
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,840
Maybe it should be the first move is just looking around for where the arfs are coming from

649
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,820
but maybe the arfs don't show up until you get a certain distance

650
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,320
to it.

651
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,540
Because that could be entirely possible. *arf*

652
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,600
Wait!

653
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,240
*Bunch of continuous waits and woah's*

654
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,040

685
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,980

686
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,880

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,300
(Sad silence)

694
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,040
Okay, well that sounds pretty good.

695
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,780

696
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,780
I explored 69 roooms

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,820

I saw that arf. Well this is a bad start.

709
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
I saw the arf.

710
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,580
It's on the other side.

711
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,860
It's somewhere wrapped around.

712
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,740
Excuse me, pa- oh god im already off to a bad start.

729
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,260
Ooh boy, ooh boy

730
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,080

735
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,780

I also like how I'm running, straight sprinting with my hand jutting out in front of me.

805
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,760
Like- The most threatening thing I could do in a room full of other people is just like-

806
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,700
HUAGH - HUAGH (mark exhaling)

Breathing heavily sprinting through, knocking over chairs with my hand stretched outwards.

808
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,120

Hello. I-I could not literally care less.

821
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,720
I don't care. You are human and therefore irrelevant to this, entire organisation.

822
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,260

How can you talk with pizza in your mouth? I don't even understand! D:

837
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:29,980
Hallo.

I was right- GAUGH! Did I go the wrong way?

845
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
AWW!

846

But it was totally worth it! :3

847
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,620
On the pool table like a- Cleo!

848
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,580
Like a good- Like a star!

849
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,480
Way over there. Ok. So I'm guessing its gonna be like a wrap around from the other side.

850
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,180
I have no reason to guess that...

851
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,860
But its gonna be over this way.

852
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,660
I need to make a right eventually.

853
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,760
Alright, here we go.

854
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,940

855
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,800

856
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,440

857
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,500
u-huh.

858
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,440
Ok there's a dog bed.

859
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,320
Dog? HUAGH (Mark inhales)

860
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,680

(Whispers) Definitely cute! &lt;3

864
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,180
Definitely 100% cute.

865
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,820
Aw man, that was a good one.

866
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,540
Aw man, there's the closet again.

867
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,120
Hello.

868
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,620
Hi.

869
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,340
How are you?

870
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,940
How you doing?

871
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,440
Good? I don't care.

872
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,100
Literally don't talk to me, just shut up. Everybody literally just- Pf-eh- Fall down a well.

873
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,940
I- I literally couldn't care.

874
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,600
There's a dog,

875
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,400
and I need to pet it. :3

876
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
I absolutely have to pet this dog.

877
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
No matter what I do, I have to pet this dog.

878
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,900
'Scuse me.

879
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,400
Pardon me.

880
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,040
Sorry!

881
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,780
Pardon me! Get out of my way!

882
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,380
Alright. Hello.

883
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,880
Hi.

884
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,420
Nice SHET!

885
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,440
I dont know what kind of person lives in this mansion but they're probably a stuck-up asshole.

886
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,980
But...

887
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,200
That was close...

888
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,440
That was VERY close.

889
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,420
Where was that??

890
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,060
Where was that?!

891
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,560
Where?

892
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,760
GUAGH! :(

893
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,100
Where Was That?!

894
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,780
That was someplace nearby!

895
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,860
Oh no..

896
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,660
o-oh-Oh no...

897
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,780
Oh no.

898
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,520
No. :(

899
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,840
No not like this! Not like this!

900
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,460
What is this? A BROKEN? IS THAT A DOOR? IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A DOOR?

901
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,320
Oh no :regret:

902
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,920
Not like this. Please.

903
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,420
HUAGH (Mark inhales)

904
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,180
SECRET DOOR!

905
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,080

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
FLORENCE! &lt;3

909
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,740
I dont think it matters which way you go because...

910
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,300
I believe there is only like probably one generated path to..

911
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,720
like the destination right?

912
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,680
It would'nt just..

913
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,540
It wouldn't just lead you around in circles right?..

914
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,860
Am I going the right way or the wrong way...

915
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,920
Hello?

916
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,600

00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,800
That was a good one. Tar- TAR! :3

947
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,100
That was so worth it!

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,260
That was so worth it!

949
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,820
I don't think im gonna get another one.

950
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,020
Unless I get like laser-focused into the exact right place that I need to go to be able to get this one pup. :(

951
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,540

This is the greatest day of my life!

965
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,180
This is the greatest day of my entire existence! :3

966
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,680

Secret door!

979
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,580
I love those secret bathroom doors.

00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,240

00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,260

Oh no.

1008
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,280
The worst thing that could ever happen to me is if I see it in sight-

1009
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,720
and I dont have enough time to get to it. :(

1010
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,800
Thats gonna crush my entire soul. D:

1011
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,640
I am never gonna forgive myself.

1012
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,200
