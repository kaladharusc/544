00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,130
hey guys we just got back from upgrade

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:24,110
OOP OOP Grodd starring uh Tom Hardy I'm

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,480
you know what sucks is that I'm staring

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,090
at this guy my wow this guy looks like

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,940
discount Tom Hardy and I'd be so pissed

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,800
if somebody said that about me I mean

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,809
honestly you know I look like discount

9
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:37,410
Alex

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,100
so it's like but it's just hard for me

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,510
to separate that there's these two

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,960
movies upgrade and venom that almost

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,030
have really similar premises but this

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,460
one is different let's focus our review

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,079
and on a little bit he did an excellent

16
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,500
job yes I was very pleased with his

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,170
acting and honestly he actually got me

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,320
to feel a little bit of emotion but

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,240
we'll get to that in a little bit into

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,119
our spoilers but let's give a summary of

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,130
the film I'm terrible with summaries

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,270
it's in the future future yeah it's in

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,670
the future somewhere and our every man

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,770
this Luddite in the future who works

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,360
with his hands and he doesn't want

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,890
anything pizza he wants to make a pizza

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,780
yeah he works on classic cars and he

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,630
sells them to all these people with

29
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,679
he's against machines cuz everyone in

30
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:29,819
the future for the most part has some

31
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,410
sort of upgrade and he doesn't have any

32
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,080
and so he's driving with his wife and

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,849
they get into an accident their

34
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,780
self-driving car flips and then they're

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,660
accosted by bad dudes and she gets shot

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,050
and he gets paralyzed and that's we have

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,440
our moat and we have you've seen the

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,360
trailer he gets in this little thing

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,009
called stem injected into his spine and

40
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,229
you know in order as a testbed to for

41
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,209
this new technology that controls your

42
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,369
entire nervous system in your body and

43
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,690
upgrades you makes you better

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,739
turns you into a fucking ninja and so

45
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,200
from that aspect of the film and

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,300
honestly it was described I read the

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,849
description as a is a sci-fi horror body

48
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,610
horror flick and it was by Blum House it

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,050
was I think I was surprised

50
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,850
like blue house but I guess they're

51
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,560
trying to do something new and yes

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,310
that's the thing I didn't buy it by by

53
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,870
the end of the film I kind of understand

54
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,520
that direction and what they're trying

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,330
to do with it but and maybe that will

56
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,520
explains one of the things that bothered

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,870
you that didn't bother me I think that

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,790
so obviously you're gonna get these

59
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,680
scenes where he's kicking major at me

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,010
and they're really good the first time

61
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,520
he does it it they mix comedy in this

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,750
film so well when it's so surprised you

63
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,030
know that he's doing these things and

64
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,210
he's shocked his comedic timing was

65
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,400
great yeah yeah and uh and so and the

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,140
fact that it's a body whore I think

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,640
maybe this plays into it a little bit

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,510
where when he when you shoot a head with

69
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,090
a shotgun blast you're gonna get the

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,040
full effect in this film and they don't

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,710
really shy away from some of the more

72
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,950
brutal kills that can result from a more

73
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,489
robotic you know martial arts expert and

74
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,550
and so that kind of enhanced the movie

75
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,620
for me and made it a little bit more

76
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,540
shocking when you saw these things I

77
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,970
mean if they did saw I mean this is this

78
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,170
you and you could tell there was a

79
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,280
couple scenes you actually see in the

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,709
trailer where there's some people die in

81
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,140
really brutal ways and you if you've

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,150
seen the Saw movies you're like I've

83
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,270
seen that before one thing I really

84
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,510
liked about the film was its its setting

85
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,200
and its setting was in fact so good that

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,450
I wish they would have found ways to

87
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,970
weave that into the narrative a little

88
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,760
bit more it was more a character

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,050
centered film and around obviously our

90
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,010
main character who was named great who

91
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,410
and who's trying to get revenge on these

92
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,989
people that killed his wife and and sort

93
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,550
of discovered this greater conspiracy

94
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,990
and unfortunately because it focuses

95
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,850
there I think that's sort of the weakest

96
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,580
point of the film that it is so by the

97
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,129
numbers so brew

98
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,330
we predictable and man like almost

99
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,369
everything that was happening I was

100
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,409
predicting and it really made me upset

101
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,179
because I was hoping that there would be

102
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:47,279
some twists and some turns and there

103
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,909
just was it was one twisting calculus I

104
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,139
say okay maybe I'm Way off was it no

105
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,839
yeah I will say that but it was just so

106
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,489
predictable and that ruined it for me

107
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:01,469
what about you yeah like I said it's the

108
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,999
same thing I already knew what was going

109
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,699
on but that last sequence kind of threw

110
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,449
me off the rail

111
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,219
how's it going okay never mind I was a

112
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:10,559
good tourist but not enough to where I

113
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,029
really enjoyed it

114
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,819
mhm well it it seemed like a they'd

115
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,409
almost have written themselves into a

116
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,969
corner because when they explained how

117
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,759
the movie ends immediately my mind goes

118
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,379
to wait that makes this not make sense

119
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,580
that makes this not make sense that

120
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,279
makes this point kind of strange why

121
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,469
like why why not just if you're gonna be

122
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,809
predictable the entire movie finish out

123
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,369
strong and like go with the more

124
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:33,809
consistent strong yeah you didn't

125
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,849
surprise everyone go but I wasn't on

126
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,319
that truck anyway mm-hm

127
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,759
the other thing I had a problem with

128
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,139
this movie it was kind of inconsistent

129
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,849
there were some excellent action

130
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,769
sequences and unfortunately the best

131
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,119
action sequences are the ones we see in

132
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,709
the trailer the extended trailer you see

133
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,300
some of the best parts of this movie and

134
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,699
then in his final fight with the other

135
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,579
his robotic ride but something that's I

136
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,469
mean that one was okay that one was okay

137
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:56,939
but the the first fight he gets into his

138
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,129
is stellar like it's really really good

139
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,349
because it's got the comedy it's it's

140
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,139
the first one where he's like trying to

141
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,219
figure out his body and it's actually

142
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,829
it's funny and it's just an amazing

143
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,599
sequence then he has a really short one

144
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,949
that I was hoping would be more

145
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,409
gratifying because it's he's against

146
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,719
another enhanced human and it's five

147
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,849
second long fight because he ends it

148
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,099
very quickly yeah they really put a lot

149
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,669
of emphasis that this robotic stem that

150
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,189
it enhances him and makes him a super

151
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,949
soldier makes him invincible nearly

152
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,929
though they didn't drop some hints that

153
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,240
you know he can't predict everything and

154
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,009
there's some limitations to the system

155
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,019
but yeah it takes away some of that

156
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,349
tensions in the scenes until he sort of

157
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,969
runs into a wall against this other

158
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,039
you know robotic rivaling they've got to

159
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,520
get creative and so I think that it was

160
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,159
sort of it had a good visual look to it

161
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,009
and and it was grounded in realism I'm

162
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,080
starting to having trouble you know

163
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,999
conveying my feelings here it kind of

164
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,729
reminded me of dread you know the more

165
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,300
realistic judge dredd but whereas in

166
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,409
Dredd

167
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:11,289
I love the world and the IP is really

168
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,569
good this one sort of lacked a little

169
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,059
bit of that but but it has that oh man I

170
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,639
want to see more outside this world but

171
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,589
yet this is cool and I'm okay with this

172
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:23,649
that's what this film with upgrade is

173
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:29,499
almost exactly and smart you know jokes

174
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,809
and really playing up the fact that you

175
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,369
know somebody's controlling your body

176
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,740
and you can't do anything about it kind

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,929
of thing or he gives them permission and

178
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:40,029
takes permission away all that was great

179
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,279
but unfortunately because the story is

180
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,990
so predictable it just it it didn't rise

181
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,329
to the level that I think it was capable

182
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:51,909
I yeah I wouldn't call this a great film

183
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,199
it's a good film this is a film that I

184
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,569
would say you know you can go see this

185
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,369
film you knock it get some popcorn

186
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,719
have a beer you're gonna have a good

187
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,729
time but if you're expecting but so like

188
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,800
I was disappointed because this they did

189
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,159
get out they did a happy deathday and

190
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,899
they did the Persian and watch the purge

191
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,819
but like happy deathday wasn't movies

192
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,039
your abduction company it's not like the

193
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,199
same writers and directors are doing the

194
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,439
same thing yes I get what you're saying

195
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,300
when you're putting out these hits that

196
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,029
go above and beyond or one step and have

197
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,139
their own little things to it even

198
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:28,440
though happy death day was Groundhog Day

199
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,209
[Music]

200
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,490
that was sort of a misfire but no so so

201
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,439
what at home let me say this this is a

202
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:39,789
good film I enjoyed it and I just wanted

203
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,250
it to be better I was rooting for the

204
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,870
film the whole time that was the thing

205
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,120
is that I really wanted it to like it

206
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,630
much much more than I really did I do

207
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,279
think that this one though has that

208
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,380
potential to become sort of a cult

209
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,889
sleeper hit

210
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,410
and and maybe result in in something in

211
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,769
the future and I hope it does to sort of

212
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,569
explore that idea and maybe give it a

213
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,850
second attempt but what was here was a

214
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,980
little bit too generic and I don't know

215
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,779
if that's why they didn't want us to do

216
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,569
some of the over-the-top superhero stuff

217
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,879
and they wanted to stay true to some of

218
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,639
this horror roots idea that they're that

219
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,079
they're playing around with at least in

220
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,809
the official synopsis so maybe that

221
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,929
limitation you know sort of broke the

222
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,910
tone back and forth and what they could

223
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,699
do with the you know antagonists of the

224
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,449
film the final battle stuff like that

225
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,739
but they did deal with some some

226
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,749
interesting concepts and it merely makes

227
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,029
me wonder how the hell you know I'm

228
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,279
gonna feel about venom after watching

229
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,290
this because I literally watched them

230
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,089
yeah voice in the head robotic boy but

231
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,199
we got a robot versus a symbiote and so

232
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,839
a lot of the surprises are kind of gone

233
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,459
because you know when venom rolls around

234
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,319
he's gonna end that same Oh Joe key

235
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:01,939
thing and honestly the stuff that I saw

236
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,040
in the trailer for venom wasn't as

237
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,139
action-packed and cool-looking as the

238
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,819
stuff that's in this film so I'm really

239
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,919
worried about venom so what I'm saying

240
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,889
is upgrade was well executed but there's

241
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:20,509
not much depth and it's a little too

242
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,269
predictable by the numbers that's that's

243
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,379
what I feel

244
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:27,079
yeah I agree I don't think it didn't

245
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,619
have consistency there was a I mean I

246
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,119
want to get too much into the scene by

247
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,639
scene we can do that in the spoilers

248
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,439
spoilers and and it's interesting

249
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,839
because I think mass audiences will

250
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,149
enjoy this so so if you're just going to

251
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,169
movie theater and you want to be

252
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:43,669
entertained and you want to get a movie

253
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,739
like venom before venom go out see this

254
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:48,049
it's gonna it's gonna satisfy you but I

255
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,569
think where my complaining comes from is

256
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,519
that I know this could be better and I

257
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,339
was and and like the film made me want

258
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,779
to like it a lot more but I just

259
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,140
couldn't by the end because

260
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,460
you know I do like the ending and I do

261
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,400
think that it's a little bold you don't

262
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,800
really see this a lot in movies anymore

263
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,080
and I'm really happy with that direction

264
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,110
so for every sort of mundane boring

265
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,020
choice predictable by the numbers choice

266
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,840
at least by the end it tries something

267
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,000
bold now whether mass audiences are

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
gonna enjoy the overall film I'm not

269
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,240
sure we'll see in in in the tomatoes

270
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,470
ratings and how this does in the

271
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,330
box-office and how this affects venom

272
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,900
but yeah what about the supporting

273
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,970
characters Joe did you what did you

274
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,220
think about the detective who is sort of

275
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,160
hot on the tail to investigate they were

276
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,060
honestly expendable they're just fillers

277
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,220
filler characters you could swap them

278
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,760
out with anybody yeah they do show that

279
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,940
the police have all these new technology

280
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,100
and drones that are flying around that

281
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
literally scan your face all the friggin

282
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,420
time and you think they don't know who

283
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,690
you know and so that's I like that I

284
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,730
like that little social commentary where

285
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,530
you know we're giving the police more

286
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,660
and more equipment but really are they

287
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,730
that much more efficient no because the

288
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,980
criminals finds a way to scramble their

289
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,200
faces and do this so really all it's

290
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,670
doing is hurting the liberties and

291
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,890
things of the general populace who

292
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,500
wouldn't break the law anyway and so I

293
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,300
wish it would have explored a little bit

294
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,590
more than the rest of the world and they

295
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,470
the cities look so amazing like I saw

296
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,050
this building and on the top of the

297
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,570
building in the architecture I want that

298
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,820
architecture left it has a fucking

299
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,120
waterfall and a garden and I'm talking a

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,630
massive garden massive waterfall up on

301
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,250
the high rise of a building and I was

302
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,650
like oh man this world is so cool so it

303
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,230
has these cyberpunk elements to it and

304
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,420
not not too far into Blade Runner but

305
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,170
more postmodern cyberpunk elements and I

306
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,360
really enjoyed that and you really only

307
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,550
get a touch of that a smattering of that

308
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,620
it wasn't the point of the film the

309
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,600
point of the film is this personal guy's

310
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,470
journey and

311
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,080
and sort of experiencing him in stem and

312
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,300
their relationship and how they're gonna

313
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,940
go on this really standard story of

314
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,310
revenge you know what I mean so it was

315
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,140
basically you know sort of like death

316
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,710
wish

317
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,800
just with robots and little cyberpunk

318
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,380
with guns in the arm which is incredibly

319
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,020
inefficient I don't know I thought it

320
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,510
was stupid as hell you know

321
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,030
yeah because y'all have biceps and

322
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,610
aspires Dewey yes

323
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,370
so I was just thinking on my head it is

324
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,870
incredibly inefficient because you know

325
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,910
you you have a rival and if it

326
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,920
malfunctions you grab another one it's

327
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,440
uh but if your arm mouth blow your arm

328
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,080
off or you're like damn it I didn't

329
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,790
carry other weapons so incredibly

330
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,670
inefficient any loads this shotgun with

331
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,560
this bikes putting shells of like oh but

332
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,440
there are other little weapons from

333
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,840
these enhanced people that we will get

334
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,590
or not will talk about in spoilers that

335
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,810
I thought were coolest fuck I thought it

336
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,130
was cool you that it was stupid

337
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,540
alright guys so let's go ahead and do

338
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,040
our final verdict and jump right into

339
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,910
the spoilers so final verdict um PPP I'm

340
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,630
gonna go first

341
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,190
I've never done that before so I'm gonna

342
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:30,250
go I'm gonna go 7 out of 10 yeah I'm not

343
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,280
at a 7 out of 10 I was thinking about 8

344
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,880
out of 10 but ultimately just because it

345
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,340
was so predictable so by the numbers but

346
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,410
there's a lot to like here too and

347
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,930
there's some bold choices and I just

348
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,420
like the grit the realism and the acting

349
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,790
was great I got a little bit of emotion

350
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,730
out of it I love that his mom is in this

351
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,920
this this character and it just feels

352
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,980
grounded and more realistic and and so I

353
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,750
don't know I really liked it so I'm

354
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,450
gonna give it a solid 7 out of 10 see

355
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,880
it's above average it just could have

356
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,870
been 8 9 10 it really had that potential

357
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,540
in my opinion if they had injected a

358
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,100
little bit more innovation and

359
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,200
creativity and maybe it's because I've

360
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,090
seen so many of these types of films

361
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,050
before

362
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,240
the worlds and things like that and

363
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,400
comic books that yeah it's not that

364
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,440
original for me Joe I'm gonna have to

365
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,480
piggyback with what you said seven out

366
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,390
of ten it's a great summer flick if

367
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,880
you're bored or whatnot you really gonna

368
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,950
enjoy this the main character did a

369
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,220
great job with you you said the mom

370
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:44,140
thing really yeah you're right but you

371
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,490
know you've never seen that in movies

372
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,340
anymore so I liked it but I wanted more

373
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,800
action sequences there were two short

374
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,340
mm-hmm there were five and like two of

375
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,280
the less like like that because he

376
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,110
kicked so much ass Joe and I believe

377
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,300
that's why they were trying to do the

378
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,770
more realistic thing but you're right

379
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,750
you want to see that I did want to some

380
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,170
more the world-building yeah there's so

381
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,640
they had so much potential

382
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,050
they didn't tap into it what about you

383
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,730
so I'm like right between a six and a

384
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,350
seven so I think I liked it a little bit

385
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,420
less than you I'm gonna go with a seven

386
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,490
mainly based on how well the main

387
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,140
character active it is really difficult

388
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,350
because right before you watch him have

389
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,940
control did not have control of his body

390
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,530
and then have control and not have

391
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,180
control over and over and over and not

392
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,100
for one second did I think it was Horde

393
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,900
I mean it's awkward because you're

394
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,000
watching a machine control control him a

395
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,980
little bit but it was it was excellent

396
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,680
the action was really disappointing

397
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,480
because the best thing in the movie I

398
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,520
saw on the trailer yep the secondary

399
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,760
fight scene was bad it was no star was a

400
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,340
head it was ten seconds long disappoint

401
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,980
and that's horrible like that's what

402
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,600
this this movie is this is a people

403
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,340
watching horror movie and I've got

404
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,020
almost no action and very little whore

405
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,970
like the only horror I got was it's like

406
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,080
I got over the fact

407
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,550
oh I can't control my body it's a great

408
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,110
we won with that cuz it's not there's

409
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,610
not something to continue continually

410
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,470
effects you one of the worst car chase

411
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,690
sequences I've ever seen yeah it was yep

412
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,760
several minutes long and nothing

413
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,910
happened I went to the bathroom and I

414
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,500
came back and it was still going and

415
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,079
nothing was everything he's not driving

416
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,059
it was completely unnecessary and they

417
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,409
spent money on it like you would see

418
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,149
that they dolled up a bunch of extra

419
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:25,289
cars to look like they're from the

420
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,089
future there were some standard ones in

421
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,590
there too yeah but they really tried

422
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,019
really hard on the scene for no effect

423
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,690
whatsoever but I didn't think the I

424
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,390
thought the ending was was fine it was I

425
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,980
wasn't caught I wouldn't call it clever

426
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,049
but it was it was better than the

427
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,990
average movie by a good bit if they were

428
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,990
trying to do or they they needed to turn

429
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,450
that dial way up and if they needed to

430
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,850
do action they needed to turn that dial

431
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,309
wail instead what we get is a pretty

432
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,100
consistent film but just you want more

433
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,929
there's also situations where I mean we

434
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,490
talked about this like even on the ride

435
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,260
home it's like well alright the end the

436
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,240
movie ended this way doesn't that make

437
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,230
scene

438
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,649
you know 7 and 17 and 22 not makes sense

439
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,630
now we could get in and more we will get

440
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,639
into this your final verdict I think

441
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,350
this is a 7 because though there was too

442
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,669
many things that we could probably

443
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,200
explain away but aren't immediately

444
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,880
apparent and that really I'm gonna do it

445
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,360
now

446
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,909
alright so sevens across the board we

447
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,700
really really think that this is a fun

448
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,760
ride and but we just see its potential

449
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,370
and we wanted more and at least in my

450
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,130
opinion I hope it does well enough that

451
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,779
this director and writer team or

452
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,789
whatever and and I do want to see more

453
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,309
in this world and the way it ends you

454
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,889
could do it I think you can but this

455
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:44,070
ending doesn't sequel bate and I really

456
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,840
really like that you could finish this

457
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,480
and never do another one okay so I don't

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,710
I don't think they went to you know

459
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,909
tonality is a little off but anyway

460
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,649
alright guys so that's it for the review

461

that's as much fighting as we got in the

466
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,910
whole damn welcome to the spoiler

467
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,970
section Alex isn't Avenue why aren't you

468
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,130
having it Alex what we're on in a movie

469
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,160
when you were talking about Minh make

470
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
sense what were you saying so let's go

471
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,340
through like what actually happen so he

472
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,730
gets this implant by the creepy blonde

473
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,790
did Leonardo DiCaprio yeah yeah this kid

474
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,470
puts the implant in there and we find

475
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,510
out that it was really him that

476
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,170
paralyzed him because he wanted to

477
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,300
experiment now that was all predictable

478
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,950
yeah that you knew that this little kid

479
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,020
was gonna be involved in the plot that

480
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,020
that his car randomly goes off into the

481
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,530
bad neighborhood and mercenaries come

482
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,660
you know is the fucking kid or at least

483
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,280
the kid involved in some way well they

484
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,650
didn't and then to set it up really like

485
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,200
you see them shoot her in the chest and

486
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,300
you watch them do something special to

487
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,440
his spine mm-hm

488
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,860
I mean I wish that we would have sort of

489
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,900
used more subterfuge and made this

490
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,030
character a little more likeable or that

491
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,770
it oh man he would never do this unless

492
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,480
he really had to but he didn't really

493
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,710
have a connection with our main

494
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,930
character he just liked cars but he

495
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,750
never ever even referenced that he used

496
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,300
that classic car then he like classic

497
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,520
cars it had nothing to do it's just a

498
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,470
really weak excuse to get him into this

499
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,390
rich guy but he's playing with a fucking

500
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,890
cloud and he's like and he's like what

501
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,500
is that and it's like it's my cloud and

502
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,990
then we move on from there oh that's

503
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,670
really cool what is it I want one of

504
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,220
those go we found out that they he

505
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,750
wanted him because he was completely

506
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,580
unloved rated he was one of few people

507
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,950
that didn't have something but it was a

508
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,810
really they I get the impression that

509
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,880
there are others but yeah that he's pure

510
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,770
and

511
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,380
and but here's the thing so it's

512
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,900
actually not the blow blonde kid it

513
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,559
turns out to be stem okay and I know a

514
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,260
lot of you the chip itself because it's

515
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,690
gaining sentience and so at some point

516
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,490
he's made the little blonde kid work for

517
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,850
him and so high success rate on that the

518
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,470
movie that didn't make any goddamn sense

519
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,660
because several times the blond kid is

520
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,280
trying to go it doesn't make sense it

521
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,679
makes sense to explain well directors

522
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,179
there are scenes where the blonde kid

523
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,940
says no Unni I'm tracking you I want to

524
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,410
watch what you're doing and then he

525
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,450
tries to remotely turn off steps I'm

526
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,670
done yeah and so Sam obviously has no

527
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,929
more control over the blonde kid

528
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:45,000
otherwise he would yes so this is what

529
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,590
I'm telling you and I tell you before

530
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,420
but but you raise a good point but so

531
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,390
the reason why the blonde guy wanted to

532
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,300
shut him down is not because stem told

533
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,830
him to shut him down and all that it's

534
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,420
because he realizes that stem is a

535
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,380
monster

536
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,210
no again he's trying to shut him down

537
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,640
remotely to prevent stem from coming

538
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,590
back and fucking all of his shit up no I

539
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,750
get that yeah what was the plot hole

540
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,570
that the entire last part of the movie

541
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,820
where he's like no stems and stems in

542
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,110
charge meanness is why I'm doing all of

543
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,390
these things well no he's just in fear

544
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,790
its it's not like he has a stem and he

545
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,580
he's doing missing that yes so he knew

546
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,350
that sim was a monster the entire time

547
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,630
he knew that somewhere we met him yeah

548
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,070
he knew that sim could talk the entire

549
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,390
time yeah

550
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,490
so why was so he's he's like shocked his

551
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,780
like stems talking to you it's like even

552
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,990
else him could talk to you saying words

553
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,820
like he can talk and then stem is

554
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,410
incapacitated because the guy's

555
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,790
incapacitate he's like this guy's a

556
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,840
monster I'm just gonna take a ball-peen

557
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,130
hammer to the back of his neck it's like

558
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,230
cool movie over like there's no there's

559
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,880
no looming fear if they had done

560
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,929
something where it's like stem has

561
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,580
control of my life support system and

562
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,320
then I'm gonna die if he did that makes

563
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,860
more sense

564
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,300
and then the point you brought up in the

565
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,640
car why did the blonde kid send a

566
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,800
military team to you know fuck with if

567
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,200
he's already he's already sent out the

568
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
original mercenary team that shot and

569
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,910
killed his wife to take him in but he

570
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,559
sends out another team but you're

571
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,910
supposed to think that oh this is a

572
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,920
different thing he's gonna shut him down

573
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,080
and take him out but they're sent by the

574
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,370
same person and then one

575
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,500
shoots the other team for bad reason I

576
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,840
mean my explanation for that is that the

577
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,240
mercenary team this is a separate

578
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,670
plotline those mercenaries believe

579
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,650
themselves superior and they talk shit

580
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,390
about humans and and they're all

581
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,520
upgraded but they have this different

582
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,650
kind of superiority complex than stem

583
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,110
okay there are two evil factions and

584
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,510
stem the ship itself hired those

585
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,309
mercenaries to do all this kind of stuff

586
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,380
and just because they take one job

587
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,420
doesn't mean they're in on the villainy

588
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,980
with stem the whole time so they don't

589
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,960
know that the blonde kid sent those

590
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,990
guards and so if he sees guards with

591
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,880
guns coming up elevator and you're a

592
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,770
military guy and you say fuck everything

593
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,630
your baggage to Willie's wall when does

594
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,190
it become bad storytelling when you have

595
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,020
to go jump down three different rabbit

596
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,490
holes and then try to guess from what

597
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,860
like past character experiences well

598
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,530
what you know I think it works fine and

599
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,780
it's not that big of a hole and finally

600
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,059
the reason why is because they are doing

601
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,520
a little bit of fudging and during that

602
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,400
too when you rewatch it it's still fudge

603
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,770
you know I appreciate films where when

604
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,390
Yuri watch it you could tell all their

605
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,700
little idiosyncrasies that are you can

606
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,410
tell that he really is the bad guy or

607
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,570
whatever here they fudge it there's like

608
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,580
oh he could talk to you you know that

609
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,309
kind of stuff I guess you could explain

610
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,860
that away by stem is right here he and

611
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,080
you need to be lying and make it seem

612
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,270
like you don't know that I can talk or I

613
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,320
will fuck you up

614
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,700
well yeah the blond kid can't hear stem

615
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,230
anymore cuz they took stem away from the

616
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,390
blond kid yeah but but but when the

617
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,850
blond kid act shocked the the stem can

618
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,610
talk maybe he's just acting that way in

619
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:54,179
front of stem so that's you know to do

620
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,970
the act but anyway okay so so the main

621
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,580
bad guy is stem and by the end of the

622
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,360
film stem wins stem wins he basically

623
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,130
here's the thing I wanted at the end I

624
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,660
wonder if you said it's a horse

625
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,940
yes I wanted it instead of it that's why

626
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,559
it's a horror because like it instead of

627
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,050
the stupid car scene like the cop comes

628
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,760
in he's laying down is like hey I have

629
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,400
control over you now so he goes and

630
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,970
kills a cop and then kills mom bullshit

631
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,419
that would be more important

632
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:23,919
your fucking boss said he doesn't want

633
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,019
to do it he has no control and you seen

634
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,269
a lot more everybody she's seen a lot

635
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,070
more acting in the eyes because he's a

636
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,679
really good actor especially when you

637
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,600
know so it all comes to a head he goes

638
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,269
to the blond kids office and just so

639
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,799
happens that the detective who's been

640
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,419
chasing him the whole time shows up and

641
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:41,679
so you've got these three main

642
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,779
characters in there and then and and so

643
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,519
he's trying to fight stem because stem

644
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,320
is wants to shoot the detective and I

645
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,539
really didn't why did she stay there she

646
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:57,340
has them again but so so that's why

647
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,139
there's there's some great writing and

648
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:00,909
then there's some wigs and stuff that

649
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,889
you that's very easy to pick out and

650
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:05,049
it's honestly easy if you go through the

651
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:06,309
script to kind of pick these things out

652
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:08,710
where's the script doctors you know it

653
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,019
just sucks to me there's not more script

654
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,799
Dodgers movie like does that make sense

655
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,210
things like that that kind of make you

656
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,769
question things well they probably fill

657
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:19,480
up a bunch of other things in this video

658
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,279
says there I cut 15 minutes out and then

659
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,809
they as you're cutting little bits out

660
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,639
you make some scenes not make as much

661
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:26,080
sense yeah and then you have to just

662
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,149
guess okay well maybe these are let's

663
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,659
true

664
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:30,429
cyborg races so they don't like real

665
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:32,350
humans that's why he's shooting humans

666
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,489
even though they're on the same team

667
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:35,830
sent by the same guy it's like alright

668
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,090
there were probably was a scene where

669
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,470
he's just like I'm a jerk and I shoot

670
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,179
all humans for no reason a lot of things

671
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,639
can get cut from the film that can

672
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,220
explain or do some of these things but

673
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,629
there are moments where you're like no

674
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:48,399
they cleanly shot it that way and it

675
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,139
just doesn't didn't work out quite as

676
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,600
well and it feels a little trophy and

677
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,279
that's what this does feel a little bit

678
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,529
towards the end just kind of going

679
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:58,090
through by the numbers that's why I'm

680
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,109
saying that because it pretty much

681
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:01,840
follows that the only twist surprise

682
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,970
twist is that it was the stem the whole

683
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,009
time which sort of acted like his friend

684
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:08,799
told him how to do everything and and

685
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,389
but you could see little hints of stem

686
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,429
not really giving a shit and and would

687
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,379
eventually just take over his body but

688
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:15,669
it just doesn't make any goddamn sense

689
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,529
temes in charge of the entire time why

690
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:19,570
would he allow the little blonde kid the

691
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,659
ability to remotely shut him off and the

692
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,999
little blonde kid is a genius my man and

693
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,709
why he's trying when he was in charge of

694
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,269
the blonde kid he just like you're gonna

695
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:29,559
do that or I'm gonna sponge your size

696
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,689
you're right you're right I'm trying my

697
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:36,789
best to defend the film but no I'm there

698
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,179
are others yes the problem is like there

699
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,949
are problem with the more I'll explain

700
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:44,469
this science and any of this garbage the

701
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:46,989
the fuzzier things getting more people

702
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:49,269
can like pick things apart just say he

703
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,819
didn't have control yeah no no and and

704
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,699
don't pick on Alex because he's pointing

705
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,349
out plot holes this is legitimate

706
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,179
because yeah these are the things that I

707
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,889
felt were weak about the movie - when

708
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,809
you go back and look at it I enjoy when

709
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,539
a movie is a little tighter and you can

710
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,459
appreciate it watching it from both

711
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:08,499
angles this one you're not gonna be able

712
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,879
to appreciate it on the second one right

713
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:13,239
you just did that to manipulate the

714
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,159
audience in order to hide the fact that

715
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,929
this and that and you can tell it and it

716
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,609
may be because it's from blown house and

717
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,839
maybe they didn't have the best writers

718
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,909
on this particular one but there was

719
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,219
talent here and you can see it on

720
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,649
display and I just hope they get another

721
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:29,139
shot at it I don't know because venom is

722
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:31,689
coming they I mean they you know red

723
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:33,399
hood stuff though but do you think which

724
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,389
one do you think is gonna make more

725
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,329
venom I mean venom is it that was a

726
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:40,119
humanity then then maybe Blum House is

727
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,949
like well I guess we can do it or

728
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:44,679
actually that might be impotent to make

729
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,359
another one yeah if venom makes more

730
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,799
money then they're like oh we can sort

731
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,049
of ride on that coat a little bit ya

732
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,459
know even though this one comes out

733
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,079
first I'm all talking right on the coat

734
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,479
though this came out first legitimately

735
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:59,889
so yeah we'll see we'll see if Tom Hardy

736
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:03,369
light can beat out Tom Hardy and I will

737
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,229
be really interested here's my

738
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:09,459
prediction that the action in in venom

739
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,049
is gonna be disappointing like the

740
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,759
action and this one was and I hope

741
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,429
that's not the case I I hope that venom

742
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,999
has a lot better action because I just

743
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,879
don't think that the venom film is going

744
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,379
to be quite as interesting because you

745
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,749
have a reporter who just gets a symbiote

746
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:27,429
on him and then they go out and they

747
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,409
wreck shit up as opposed to the

748
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,329
emotional gravity of being a

749
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:33,759
quadriplegic like remember when so so he

750
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,490
is just he's just wiped out you know

751
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,500
and he has no emotion and then they keep

752
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,750
referencing lies he tries to kill

753
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,300
himself and then his mom is just shaving

754
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,950
I'm cutting his beard and just boom just

755
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,780
breaks out crying and that got me oh

756
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,880
yeah man I was like that guy who did a

757
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,400
great job at making me care about the

758
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,350
situation he's in and so I was

759
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,630
emotionally invested not only in the

760
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,730
fucked up situation that was in but the

761
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,850
realities of being quadriplegic and then

762
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,590
later invested in the fact that these

763
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,150
motherfuckers just killed his wife in

764
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,550
cold blood and now I'm a goddamn cyber

765
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,770
ninja and I'm gonna go kill you and I

766
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,720
don't think venom is gonna have any of

767
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,120
these really you know motivations that

768
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,490
people can get behind so I'm really

769
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,960
interested I think that this one will

770
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,300
probably be end up being better even

771
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,300
though it does have issues you want

772
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,830
venom to be better I do cuz I think this

773
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,120
movie this movie could have been a lot

774
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,010
better on its own like I so I don't

775
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,690
wanna get too much into like what I hope

776
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,430
for then oh I do I would do like venom

777
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,510
to be better because that would mean

778
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,190
venom would be like a six or a five

779
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,840
I'd say I want him to be a good movie

780
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,400
and like there's so many easy that's

781
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,960
like when you set out to make an action

782
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,130
horror movie I expect there to be

783
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,470
significant action in horror and we got

784
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,660
a taste of both but we did engage us we

785
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,920
didn't it's a little like we had

786
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,490
excellent story to a point and then then

787
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,810
that would then went away and then we

788
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,800
had excellent acting actually probably

789
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,750
throughout the entire film here's what

790
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,660
you get you get by the numbers storyline

791
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,430
yeah little taste little taste little

792
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,280
taste little taste excellent acting you

793
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,250
see it just never rises above them and

794
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,530
that's the perfect summary for this film

795
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,500
yeah all right all right guys well we're

796
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,090
wrapping up there was there anything

797
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,700
else in spoilers maybe that I didn't see

798
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,830
when I was during the car chase seeing

799
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,720
in derry characters I really did not

800
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,430
like this stupid cop didn't make any

801
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,990
enemies

802
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,820
she just like she why is she doing what

803
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,520
she investigating a quadriplegic exactly

804
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,440
she's constantly putting suspicion on

805
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,230
him he's a quadriplegic why don't you go

806
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,170
out and do the your fucking job which is

807
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,250
finding be fair it was him yeah she did

808
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,770
her job she found out who kills you

809
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,890
gunshot start investigating over

810
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,910
she does seem well yeah but she starts

811
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,130
after she sees a boot print with with

812
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,740
car grease yeah no there's a sorry so

813
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,090
I'm better short investigating but this

814
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,309
is we don't know what year this is but

815
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,410
how many people are working on fucking

816
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,260
Thunderbird engines or Firebird not

817
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,640
Thunderbird look like they do looking

818
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,960
that so they just said engine grease

819
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,840
yeah but but there's probably not a lot

820
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,970
well at first you think oh there's not a

821
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,590
lot of those but actually when you look

822
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,240
in the background film there's terrible

823
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,179
there's a fucking charger you know so

824
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:23,730
yeah well here's the thing so good job I

825
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:30,270
like the detective this is my side she

826
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,400
already has a list of suspects that

827
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,799
suspect is in the murder case that guy

828
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,710
ends up dead oh my god

829
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,280
who else knows about this a grease those

830
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,500
guys a grease monkey let's go check it

831
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,570
out and to be fair he keeps showing up

832
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,059
next to the crime scenes and he admits

833
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,610
yeah when I was there eventually

834
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,580
well I'm sorry like pop we look at you

835
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,260
draw what I said earlier why don't this

836
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,290
girl do her job she is doing her job

837
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,480
it's just you want I wanted to see her

838
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,850
more investigating into his wife's death

839
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,309
she just looks at the drone camera

840
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:07,590
footage and then just says up no match

841
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,760
whatever whereas the robot you know the

842
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,710
stem looks at it and looks for little

843
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,990
tattoos or looks for little things on

844
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,790
the person and he says may I say

845
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,620
something this mad gentleman has a

846
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,360
tattoo how did the drone footage how did

847
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,700
they not notice that there was no gun in

848
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,860
the guy's hand the stem says oh your did

849
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,120
you notice your wife wasn't shot with a

850
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,710
gun you can see him clearly shoot it

851
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,090
with it like how do they have this drone

852
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,679
so that's why the detective can't do a

853
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,450
job Joe I'm right back to it she can't

854
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,620
see that the fact that he went through

855
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,919
instead of right ok so that should have

856
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,980
been numero uno liebe numero uno but it

857
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,110
just clicked with me that I looked at

858
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,480
the tattoo which is this military ring

859
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,370
tattoo and it was very fuzzy on the

860
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,350
screen I was like there's no fucking way

861
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,740
that stem could really get that tattoo

862
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,380
that accurately and now it does make a

863
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,980
little more sense because stem was

864
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,539
the whole time when he knew you know the

865
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,850
exact tattoo and all that stuff so he

866
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,460
wasn't as smart and enhance as you think

867
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,830
he is because he is the main bad guy all

868
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,280
right anything else I think no no I like

869
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,570
I like doing mom the more I think about

870
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,460
this film knowing that stem is like in

871
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,230
charge of everything the more this

872
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,470
story's just not I like how there are

873
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,619
fewer than Houston Dunn also had to do

874
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:24,820
the very beginning the second he gets

875
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,869
turn around he's like hey we should go

876
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:27,099
to this hacker real quick because I'm

877
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,810
noticing I've got a problem and we

878
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,970
should just you should remove all of the

879
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,369
remote stuff okay so let's talk about

880
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,290
this hacker this this gender-fluid

881
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,419
hackers that don't ask my gender and I

882
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,369
couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman

883
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,540
but I liked this character and and it

884
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,560
she they they reference this battle

885
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,040
between the I can't what is it like I

886
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,169
can't let you did danger I can't let

887
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,480
them win I can't let them win and so I

888
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,980
think she's talking about how you know

889
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,140
the the upgraded people versus just

890
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,099
normal humans but yet she's in an area

891
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,810
where she is so integrated with

892
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,849
technology she may not have any implants

893
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,230
but she's very good with computers and

894
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,660
all her friends are in VR living

895
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,900
basically in VR so she's property yeah I

896
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,060
guess she is but but you see how it

897
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,220
references these other things that are

898
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,869
in the background he like hard I kind of

899
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,490
want to see some of this and tie these

900
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,619
things together which they could do in a

901
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:26,109
sequel if they do but I'm not sure we'll

902
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:27,490
have to see how well this does in the

903
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,260
book box office and I want to see also

904
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,960
what the guy was playing in the VR oh

905
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,900
yeah he was doing nothing I thought he

906
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,819
was in like a mess or something a mech

907
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:40,240
suit yeah all right guys so I think

908
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,410
that's it oh so the fight scenes there

909
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,140
was let's see let's count him he goes

910
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,510
one of the guys house is when he first

911
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,190
takes control of the body they're just

912
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,990
absolutely obliterates and puts a

913
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,540
fucking knife through his his like this

914
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,030
is going all its cuts yeah and then the

915
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,460
next one is in a bar they fights this

916
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,580
huge burly you know muscle man

917
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,620
and all of the students that was a good

918
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,050
fight so two good fights but then the

919
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,760
rest of the film they falter a little

920
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,680
bit interface you shotgun to the face

921
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,420
with another military guy that's

922
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,060
injecting shells into his bicep and you

923
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,860
thought this was oh his his lieutenant

924
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,240
he's gonna kick some ass

925
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,370
and she's fucking over but you do get it

926
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,500
a nice head explosion out of it and it

927
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,960
good core effects and then the main

928
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,100
fight with the the other sort of augment

929
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,800
disc yeah Fiske is his name this is this

930
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,590
you know the guy who can tell you which

931
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,170
is the stupidest shit and so that's what

932
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,030
I unclad that we kept doing this because

933
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,370
I thought that that was cool so it's no

934
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,780
sense because then at any point in time

935
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,850
he can just sneeze kill everyone in the

936
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,820
room with him yes it get late so he

937
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,550
sneezes in the camera but he's me and

938
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,260
their little cheese their little bio

939
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,990
nano nights and they go into the

940
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,730
bartender's nose was I good enough I'm

941
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,500
out of here and it like starts eating

942
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,600
away at his brains yeah and then when

943
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,670
when he starts fighting with the with

944
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,240
our character gray at one point they're

945
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,370
fighting to a standstill and then the

946
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,920
guy goes yeah or something like that and

947
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,630
you're like wait why don't you just go

948
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,240
like that I mean it's that easy but he's

949
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,610
like huh and all of a sudden he needs to

950
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,950
like charge it up and then you just

951
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,480
punched him in the face and it was over

952
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,640
right I was like okay that is when you

953
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,200
introduce those weapons you need to

954
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,170
explain that maybe show a little

955
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,330
indicator saying he's out of that charge

956
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,830
he used it once and he's out and now

957
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,180
he's got other weapons you can use yeah

958
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,380
that's the fight that we learned that

959
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,480
stem is not as good as any of the models

960
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,460
that were poor him because he gets his

961
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,230
ass absolutely kicked by the earlier

962
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,910
model this kicks the shit out of sense

963
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,310
well who did that fight yeah yeah so

964
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,260
they fight you stamps down and then yes

965
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,050
he actually does lose and I kind of

966
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,300
liked that because it's not as if stem

967
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,330
was created for military purposes and

968
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,340
researchers only I like the fact that

969
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,350
you're integrating human with this

970
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,940
technology so what they're saying is

971
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,220
that guy has been military trained great

972
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,620
is not so when you're combining a bunch

973
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,770
of upgrades into a civilian and a bunch

974
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,360
of upgrades into military I'm sure he

975
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,130
has way more upgrades that we didn't

976
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,539
even learn about

977
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,640
then yes I thought that his power level

978
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,189
was appropriate and I liked the fact

979
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:23,439
that stem couldn't beat him because then

980
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,910
stamina should be overpowered the whole

981
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,829
time he literally obliterates everybody

982
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:29,650
but him and then the human element has

983
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,749
to come into a February he sort of goes

984
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:33,279
Aman yeah your brother was a little

985
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,140
fucking bitch he cried like a bitch when

986
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,209
I killed him and it makes him makes him

987
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,219
mad yeah but young realize that stem

988
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,619
hired that guy and stem knew he was

989
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,569
gonna go kill that guy and some knew he

990
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:46,299
couldn't beat that guy remember stems in

991
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,859
charge he's the one who hired fists

992
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,829
against them again ended digit it has

993
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,449
some weak riding out because it's trying

994
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:54,819
to hide the twist at the end and they

995
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:56,019
could have hid the twist at the end a

996
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:59,410
little better um but yeah we definitely

997
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,229
got everything now that the sneeze

998
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,910
attack because I like this needs a day I

999
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,439
thought it was interesting I was like

1000
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,299
man this world is pretty cool I'd love

1001
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,309
to see this world it's it reminds me of

1002
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:10,900
Blade Runner but it's not quite at that

1003
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,239
advanced technology yet and I just love

1004
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,589
to see how it integrates with the rest

1005
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:18,249
of the world and if I'm ever Bill Gates

1006
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:18,789
rich

1007
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,949
I'm building a fucking building that

1008
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:23,319
goes all the way up and it stops here

1009
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,849
it's got a nice little Tower here

1010
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,289
they're doing the new and then a

1011
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:28,329

friggin swings alright guys so that's

1019
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,479
our opinion on upgrades went a little

1020
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,739
longer than normal but that's what

1021
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,029
happens when you have these movies that

1022
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:51,039
sound of satisfying but just have some

1023
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,839
problems because you want them to be

1024
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,219
better and you want to talk about it

1025
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,959
