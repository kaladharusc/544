1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,559
44 seconds of logos birds fly away to

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,540
signify danger cliche also chimps are

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,920
terrible about knowing when humans are

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,420
in their jungle I'm gonna get one shot

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,730
one shot is all I need you only get one

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,230
shot one shot is all I need cliche

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,910
monkey decides to freak out and break

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,619
loose at the exact same moment James

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,180
Franco is pitching the sensitive money

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,830
people on funding his monkey drug we're

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,930
ready to move on to the next phase human

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,880
trials yep medicine companies definitely

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,289
go from one successful Monkey Trial

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,600
directly to human trials this is totally

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
legit these guys should have way more

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,719
training expertise and common sense than

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,790
to do this these are discount actual

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,620
monkey scientists guards full-on murder

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,390
the ape with people in the room they

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,399
don't have tranquilizers also security

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,450
guard shoots potentially dangerous

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,059
monkey instead of sleeping or sleeping

23
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,980
know everything about the human brain

24
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,920
except the way it works Oh stuff it he

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,270
knows tons about how the human brain

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,770
works you're just looking for a lazy

27
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,780
zinger oh come on they get a bunch of

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,609
wild apes conduct millions of tests are

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,170
there with them every day for hours and

30
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,670
hours and they didn't know bright eyes

31
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,300
was pregnant

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,500
also this might be something that would

33
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,150
be difficult to spin with investors but

34
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,409
seems like if you've got a drug that can

35
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,030
make billions of dollars admitting that

36
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,320
you didn't know the egg was pregnant and

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
that that was the reason she went crazy

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,130
would turn it around in time certificate

39
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,689
of appreciation monkey conveniently

40
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,250
bonds to human just as human is about to

41
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,110
kill monkey right away Caesar displayed

42
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,060
hello there he's just gonna start

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,710
narrating like we haven't sat through 14

44
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,540
minutes of movie already also three

45
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,820
years later he kept a monkey hidden in a

46
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,080
residential neighborhood for three

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,060
fucking years and no one ever looks at

48
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,490
their neighbors windows ever and please

49
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,200
just pretty long will carries around a

50
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,369
chess piece so that he could reflect

51
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,630
dramatically on this point while

52
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,280
recording his notes scientists running

53
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,360
out of time and patience with his

54
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,979
father's disease tests his theories on

55
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:41,759
his own flesh and blood

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,259
stealing is only wrong when you're not

57
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,329
motivated by Alzheimer's so wait the lab

58
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,590
isn't getting funding to produce this

59
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,820
drug anymore because of the brighteyes

60
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,500
incident but still produce large

61
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,360
quantities of it anyway he steals these

62
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,009
vials but the lab never does inventory

63
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,329
or anything because no one ever notices

64
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,770
they're missing hey didn't the nurse

65
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,049
quit after the last outburst who was

66
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,520
watching daddy Rodman all day while his

67
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,020
son was at work stealing medicine the

68
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,790
chimp open window causes no concern for

69
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,140
will even though there's a wandering

70
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,090
chimp in the house also no surprise open

71
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,649
window allows Caesar to escape during

72
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,450
crucial part of the plot also monkey

73
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,129
only notices open escape window after

74
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,390
ignoring it all night long

75
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,710
guess it wasn't time to escape

76
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,320
yeah these are can't gone far how the

77
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,640
fuck do you know you can't have gone far

78
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,680
piano man won't happen again

79
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
there might a Walt Carbon Copy asshole

80
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,980
neighbor who's carbon copy also

81
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,530
sweatbands

82
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,240
he likes Frieda Pinto is not my

83
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
girlfriend wife and mistress in this now

84
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,900
just match my online dating profile -

85
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,490
were already Andy Serkis isn't winning

86
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,780
an Oscar in this scene brilliant

87
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,730
scientist drives a woody that's not a

88
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,180
sin I just wanted to say the word woody

89
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,650
so for five years Will's been taking

90
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,060
Cesar to the redwoods and this is the

91
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,650
first time there's been an incident or

92
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,270
anyone who has ever noticed a freaking

93
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,770
chimp being taken into the redwoods

94
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,840
see this is where I work no one here

95
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,790
will see you a monkey in this car in the

96
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,350
parking lot because scientists are

97
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,420
unobservant haha original Planet of the

98
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,190
Apes reference mustang owners are always

99
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,420
leaving their car doors open with the

100
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,280
keys in the ignition it's a very common

101
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,430
problem this honking driver is oblivious

102
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,230
to the absolutely amazing terrifying

103
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,230
scene directly in front of him it's

104
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,450
animal control not an ambulance right

105
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,070
Animal Control transports dangerous

106
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,630
monkey in van with no restraints

107
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,980
whatsoever is it bad that I knew the

108
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,480
evil animal shelter guy was going to be

109
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,130
Brian Cox before I even knew he was in

110
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,610
this movie

111
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,780
thank goodness San Francisco has a

112
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,790
closeby monkey sanctuary handy otherwise

113
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,630
this movie would have been a lot of

114
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,150
driving monkey Truman show you know I

115
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,920
don't see a ring on that finger five

116
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,390
years dating Frieda Pinto and you

117
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,070
haven't married her hell it'd be a sin

118
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,060
if it was five months

119
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,620
hey Tom you know that character malifaux

120
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,610
me you play in the Harry Potter series

121
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,460
just do that that's racist now you

122
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,470
hardly have a show so is there a reason

123
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,240
why the business minded Jacobs has kept

124
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,930
him on the payroll

125
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,460
especially after the disaster in the

126
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,290
beginning of the film hell they nearly

127
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,540
fired him on the spot then the 112 is

128
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,060
dangerous well and it doesn't work also

129
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,800
did he not ever tell his boss about how

130
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,090
the evil drug jump was actually just

131
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,050
protecting its baby

132
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,720
did he not ever start work on 113 or any

133
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,610
other new drug I'm trying to figure out

134
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,320
how he's not fired after the 112 was

135
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,580
scrapped and he was told to start over

136
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,710
but never did and that was years ago I

137
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,540
choose my father with it does one

138
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,770
brilliant scientist isn't fired

139
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,510
immediately his boss finds out he stole

140
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,860
a three-year-old drug and gave it to his

141
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,450
father I'll give you whatever you need

142
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,560
Medical boss just believes his

143
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,790
scientists when he says his dad was

144
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,500
cured with stolen drugs and orders new

145
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,330
testing without actually verifying that

146
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,859
the drug actually works by looking at

147
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,020
any data because big money decisions are

148
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,000
always made that way aerosol deliver and

149
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,560
play they used to give the monkeys the

150
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,840
112 by injecting them but with the 113

151
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,890
they have this fancy Green Goblin

152
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,300
aerosol delivery chamber

153
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,889
system which is only so they can infect

154
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,300
the snarky lab assistant guy and have a

155
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,330
cool everything goes wrong moment that

156
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,069
is a pink sweatshirt he just ripped off

157
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,750
Caesars body cleaned like he was doing

158
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,280
the tablecloth trick not possible what

159
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,370
that EEP said is racist Draco ex machina

160
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,500
guy who sneezes blood tells no one and

161
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,759
doesn't go to the doctor so that he can

162
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,319
die later in the story we they went and

163
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,550
grabbed his ripped sweatshirt from the

164
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,409
main ap yard and returned it to his cell

165
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,629
why hey girls let's go pound some beers

166
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,460
at the animal shelter then that sound

167
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,720
like a place where everyone has fun and

168
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
gets laid he's Cornelia haha original

169
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
Planet of the Apes reference I'm rooting

170
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,879
for Caesar but there's pretty much no

171
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,319
way he could have taken this knife also

172
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,669
how did he figure out what looked like a

173
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,469
regular bottle opener also served as a

174
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,050
pocket knife oh now you're gonna seek

175
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,669
help about your medical problem Jesus

176
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,879
this asshole always around also

177
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,009
convenient asshole comeuppance cliche

178
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,629
will gives up way too quickly after

179
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,789
being rejected by Caesar I mean we know

180
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,500
Caesar has moved on but will doesn't

181
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,360
Caesar wins over all the Apes with a bag

182
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,009
of chips ahoy we interrupt this Planet

183
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,120
of the Apes reboot to bring you the

184
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,979
beginning of 2001 how did this asshole

185
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,030
get in the house without breaking

186
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,380
something or are they still leaving

187
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,639
windows and doors open in this house

188
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
thank God will kept all that 113 aerosol

189
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,569
in his fridge after his dad died jumping

190
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,159
on a Mustang makes the grill fall off

191
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,169
because Ford how did Caesar get back

192
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:41,490
into the animal shelter without being

193
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,259
seen remember he had to go out through

194
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,150
the glass dome thing and he slid down to

195
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,190
the ground that's way too high and slick

196
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,409
to climb back up even for him sure I

197
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,430
guess he could have walked through the

198
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,090
front door

199
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,199
it's not like the landings are

200
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,789
incredible at their job or anything how

201
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,740
did Caesar know that this would work a

202
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,930
human being in his position looking at

203
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,400
strange cans in the fridge wouldn't know

204
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,810
for sure that jamming a knife in the

205
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,550
cans would create a slow enough release

206
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,139
that rolling the canisters down the hall

207
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,000
would infect all the Apes dude sees Apes

208
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,190
totally conspiring but so the movie can

209
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,840
continue shrugs it off I guess after

210
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,159
Franklin couldn't get in contact with

211
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,779
will that one time he totally gave up

212
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,669
forever and never used a phone or email

213
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,259
or anything explaining his condition

214
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,330
haha Charlton Heston for filthy mudblood

215
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,919
am i right ok then awesome I'm taking

216
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,810
ass in off for that right there also

217
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,069
Caesars gonna count to five and then

218
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,240
he's gonna start beating the shit out of

219
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,129
you over a ping billfold Caesar does

220
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,599
what Harry Potter took eight movies to

221
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,979
not do apes escaped Detention Facility

222
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,960
and procreate to triple their numbers in

223
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,460
roughly two hours Apes moving through

224
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,249
the trees remove roughly 90% of all

225
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,259
leaves no worries I know where he's

226
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,359
headed cliche this place has infrared

227
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,609
security cameras are you kidding me

228
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,409
also scotch tape dispenser fits in

229
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,429
perfectly with high-tech security

230
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,859
workstation sunglasses indoors are you

231
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,239
seriously trying to tell me that Caesar

232
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,309
stomped on his way to jens's to draw

233
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,169
graffiti wait he was just walking from

234
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,819
the underground employee parking lot and

235
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,109
now he's in the lobby like he just

236
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,819
walked in the front door cool shot but

237
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,959
what was the plan

238
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,519
hey guys after we destroyed the building

239
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,989
let's form a multi-tiered stare down

240
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,849
offensive well if Jacobs had gone on

241
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,619
vacation what if Jacobs had gotten a

242
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,779
phone call not to come in how long were

243
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,309
they willing to wait also what was the

244
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,909
point of that

245
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,619
hey Jacobs you're an asshole okay

246
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:16,879
everybody now let's get the fuck out of

247
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,589
here and not one of these Apes chased

248
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,389
after Jacobs or ran out the same exit he

249
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,309
did so we see the animal control vehicle

250
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,539
in the background here but in the next

251
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,159
shot the officer is already shooting a

252
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,539
net at this lone ape in the middle of

253
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,099
the street and all the freed apes in San

254
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,719
Francisco decided to hang back and save

255
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:31,699
this one ape look I know they're smart

256
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,289
and all but they're just wildly running

257
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,489
through the streets how do they even

258
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,229
begin to know there's one lost chimp

259
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:37,639
about to get captured by Animal Control

260
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,469
also it doesn't seem like killing is

261
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:40,369
exactly their style

262
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:41,959
I didn't kill Jacobs even though they

263
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,999
had a huge chance to do so but here they

264
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,469
keep throwing spears at this dude hoping

265
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:47,329
he dies a grisly death I suppose manhole

266
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,649
cover only goes halfway through wimpy

267
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:49,969
car windshield when really both these

268
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,409
cops ought to be dead traffic on the

269
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,669
Golden Gate Bridge is conveniently

270
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:53,869
stopped already so that there could be

271
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:55,279
hundreds of people in harm's way when

272
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,379
the Apes come through the bridge how the

273
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,409
hell can you know that from here if you

274
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:01,579
knew they were going to the bridge why

275
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,779
didn't you chase them down while they

276
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,549
were kicking it on a trolley why didn't

277
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:05,809
ya my roadblocks set up on the south

278
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,399
side before they even got there how the

279
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,689
hell did these assholes get on the

280
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,449
bridge this attempted murders somehow

281
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,589
different from all the other potential

282
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:13,879
murders they could have committed during

283
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,769
the escape why didn't all the simians

284
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,629
take this route it's the safest spot on

285
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,459
the whole bridge Caesar is pretty damn

286
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,629
smart but I think he missed a golden

287
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:22,279
opportunity to use this bridge the right

288
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,019
way fog rolls in at just the right time

289
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,399
to make it hard for the cops to see the

290
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,379
Apes okay great so they formed the cops

291
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,489
and totally got the drop on this

292
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,079
roadblock but there's absolutely no

293
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,610
reason why they need to engage them in

294
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,050
any way they could have sneaked past

295
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,339
them in the fog and not even risk

296
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,199
getting shot in fact since they have a

297
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:37,550
rule about not killing anymore this

298
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,479
attack seems pointless

299
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,680
oh okay I guess this murder is fine then

300
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,330
this is for King Kong or something bad

301
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,190
guy somehow survives fiery helicopter

302
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,660
crash because it's not cathartic enough

303
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,220
for him to die unless the angry drug

304
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,730
1/13 test ape is the one doing it my

305
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,900
mother always said if you can't say

306
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,340
something nice while dying you shouldn't

307
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,840
say anything while dying at all a bunch

308
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,250
of smart apes that just destroyed San

309
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,660
Francisco we're now taking residence in

310
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,250
the redwoods I'm pretty sure that's the

311
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,570
cue for the US government to start

312
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,640
bombing Redwood National Park take that

313

nature

314
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,850
maybe they sure to call this rise of the

315
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:18,660
12 monkeys ever since cinemasins began

316
