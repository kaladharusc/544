please state your name for the record

Daniel Ocean Oh credit oh wait oops

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,150
guess I jumped the gun there a bit I

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,500
mean the spirit of the sin is still

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,029
covered by this movie moment technically

7
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,500
premature celebration on my part you

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,359
might say the purpose of this hearing is

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,160
to determine whether if released you are

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,810
likely to break the law again George

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,039
Clooney begins the movie by being

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,330
paroled and immediately hatches a

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,890
criminal plan click shit also I know

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,779
this is a prison and all but is this

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,610
room is there a law that mandates they

16
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,899
hold these hearings and what looks like

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,969
a set from the Saw franchise well this

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,710
was your first conviction you have been

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,350
implicated though never charged and over

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,790
a dozen other confidence schemes and

21
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,160
frogs experts position is it likely to

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,620
fall back into a similar pattern she

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,149
already left me once I don't think she'd

24
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,829
do it again just for kicks look the only

25
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,300
reason Danny's getting paroled here is

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,860
because he's George Clooney not only did

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,120
he not answer the question this is a

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,770
pretty dickish thing to say to a parole

29
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,390
board I mean even red had a better

30
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,550
rapport in Shawshank Clooney is the only

31
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,739
DC film star here marble is represented

32
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,390
out the ass Topher Grace from spider-man

33
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,970
3 Don Cheadle from the MCU Matt Damon

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,189
from thor ragnarok Brad Pitt from the

35
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,390
movie I'm not comfortable naming just

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,439
yet given the date of this video's

37
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,900
release but for DC just cloning here

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,340
Marvel is even winning the oceans

39
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,040
casting wars are you saying Oh Frank

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
why doesn't Frank recognize Danny until

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,340
he calls him by name not only does he

42
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,869
know who he is he knows his entire

43
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:22,470
situation

44
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,240
Shane unless I heard he was teaching

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,280
movie stars how to play cards Danny and

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,750
Frank played the pronoun game for some

47
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,400
reason even though we know this movies

48
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
already going on way too long without

49
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,190
Brad pity

50
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,990
no sir I wouldn't even think about

51
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,460
leaving the state and the rest of the

52
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,510
movie will happen without a single

53
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,160
parole officer calling or showing up to

54
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,690
ask questions and thus begins the

55
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,580
annoying habit of rusty eating and or

56
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,900
drinking something in nearly every scene

57
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,920
he's in seriously

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,120
that motherfucker should be 300 pounds

59
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,710
by the end of this movie this teaching

60
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,240
Hollywood peeps how to poker scene is

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,190
hilariously dated he's teaching Topher

62
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,810
Grace Shane West the least famous

63
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,270
Charmed girl 7-7 guy and Joshua Jackson

64
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,340
maybe just maybe your references would

65
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,870
have lasted longer if he'd chosen film

66
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,730
actors instead of TV actors or just

67
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,800
avoided the goddamn WB's early TV slate

68
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,510
also Topher Grace in a movie with too

69
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,280
many villains movie sucks Topher Grace

70
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,750
in a movie with too many honks works

71
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,500
every time

72
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,090
you can't have three pairs you can't

73
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,830
have six cards in a five card game yeah

74
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,630
but that's pretty much on rusty here he

75
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,160
didn't notice the misdeal but gave Shane

76
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,870
the extra card given how clueless these

77
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,460
assholes are sure does seem like Rusty's

78
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,470
a teacher I will see you on five hundred

79
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,170
and I will raise you another five

80
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,820
hundred string betting Holly this

81
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,650
opening Hollywood bull goes on for way

82
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,100
too long

83
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,530
New York's hottest club is deep its

84
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,420
keyhole logo icon is only half the

85
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,250
unlockable treasure waiting within this

86
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,380
hot spot that merges lust danger and

87
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,570
ambivalence also the fuck's up with club

88
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,340
boob back there sounds like a much

89
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,980
better place for a poker tutorial this

90
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,390
little gag about Topher Grace being

91
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,100
swarmed by fans as Brad Pitt and George

92
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,600
Clooney casually walked by has always

93
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,500
made me giggle

94
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,780
once it off wanna knock over to see I

95
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,070
know they're tucked away in a booth but

96
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,420
there are people around them in this

97
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,800
restaurant they could have talked about

98
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,390
this extremely illegal plan in the car

99
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,190
or even in the parking lot safely out of

100
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,770
earshot Boesky a Jim Brown a Miss Daisy

101
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,750
to Jethro's and Leon Spinks not to

102
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,370
mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald

103
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,220
ever whoa that's racist honestly I'm not

104
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,840
sure so I guess I'll send this

105
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,519
ridiculous heist e-code speak that

106
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,320
sprinkled in all these movies

107
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,310
hey Oscar lower the bed would you

108
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,560
sorry what Oscar should be sorry about

109
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,420
is using a flashlight to cause the first

110
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,069
of many unnecessary fake outs in this

111
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,840
brightly lit room Jesus the level of

112
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,400
handsome in this movie is off the charts

113
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,720
you'd think it'd be enough to remove us

114
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880
in but this movie is too handsome you

115
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,560
know the three most successful robberies

116
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
in the history of Vegas they most

117
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,280
assuredly do no this but will be treated

118
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
with an expositional flashback just to

119
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,610
bring this point home and the closest

120
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,340
any man has ever come to robbing a Las

121
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,769
Vegas casino seriously the most

122
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,150
successful attempts at biggest robbery

123
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,410
have involved people running through the

124
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,880
casino with huge amounts of cash in

125
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,780
plain sight

126
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,810
just out of curiosity which casinos did

127
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,750
you geniuses Victor ah wait hold up the

128
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,980
actual casinos in question weren't

129
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,239
revealed when they told him the plan

130
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,069
that's bad enough on its own but when

131
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,959
you factor in that this guy hates the

132
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,580
dude that owns the three casinos they

133
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,530
eventually named it's even worse in real

134
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,760
life these fools would have started with

135
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
Terry Benedict sucks some now in

136
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,390
crafting this all-star cast for the

137
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,160
casino heist reboot film they still

138
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,510
ended up with Casey Affleck and Scott

139
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,920
Caan in this movie proving that the

140
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,450
power of nepotism still beats the power

141
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,360
of most anything else in Hollywood

142
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,700
Brothers hours nerves okay not so bad

143
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,229
you notice the way this old-timey phrase

144
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,030
is shoehorned into Rusty's dialogue I'm

145
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,410
expecting the rest of his lines to be

146
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,600
peppered with a few 23 skidoo 'he's at

147
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
least a couple of horse feathers and one

148
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
hang Langille go find great stone my

149
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,260
needs soon oh just find him well yeah of

150
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,940
all the times I could say this works in

151
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,990
this movie this is that this works hist

152
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,250
badger know for sure that no one was

153
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,750
going to be in that car or is he okay

154
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,620
with casual homicide sir okay which

155
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,110
one's the amazing young the little

156
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,270
Chinese guy that's racist the director

157
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,710
said let's have you carve up an orange

158
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,180
in the scene so that you can be unique

159
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,710
and edgy but still not so much of an

160
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,940
asshole that the viewers can't relate to

161
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,620
you are you gonna treat me like a

162
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,690
grown-up at least tell me what the scam

163
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,010
is

164
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,930
dog track races are not this loud

165
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,310
especially since we heard everything

166
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,350
they said up until now quite clearly you

167
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,730
want to keep me in the dark just been

168
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,390
cut away

169
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,100
Jesus you dick anything we need one more

170
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,080
do you think we need one more yeah but

171
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,090
that one more is Matt Damon it was

172
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,470
apparently the best thief on the planet

173
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,150
right this is phrased as an afterthought

174
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,680
but he would have been a huge part of

175
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,030
the plan from the beginning in case you

176
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,680
confused it with Chicago California I

177
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,060
don't doubt that Will Hunting is a great

178
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,770
thief but what kind of jagoff keeps his

179
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,180
wallet in this location on a crowded

180
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,800
train despite being super thief Matt

181
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,420
Damon super thief Matt Damon doesn't

182
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,770
notice the obvious theft from his own

183
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,690
pocket this pair has had this printed

184
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,160
for years and keeps it in a safety

185
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,470
deposit box or some there's no way he's

186
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,640
had time to get them printed since

187
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,590
leaving jail and you're pretty trusting

188
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,710
pretty fast could get the check please

189
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,850
that's the best lift I've seen you make

190
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,430
yet you mean even better than that super

191
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,810
quick theft of the wallet on the train

192
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,160
he looked away from the table and even

193
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,170
lifted his fucking hand this movie has

194
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,280
entirely too much drone footage porn

195
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,930
what did you guys get a group rate or

196
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,140
something but no seriously did you this

197
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,490
is a great question considering that

198
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,540
even though they're coming from all over

199
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,010
the country these assholes arrive at

200
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,350
exactly the same time gentlemen the 3000

201
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,960
block of Las Vegas Boulevard otherwise

202
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,060
known as the Bellagio the Mirage and the

203
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,250
MGM Grand for a movie specifically about

204
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,110
Las Vegas this is really obscuring the

205
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,580
geography not only are all three of

206
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,080
these casinos actually separated by

207
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,850
several other casinos they're not really

208
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,440
on the same block it's like saying the

209
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,910
Upper West Side of Manhattan otherwise

210
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,440
known as Central Park and the Dakota

211
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,420
this place houses a security system that

212
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,730
rivals most nuclear missile silos this

213
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,260
says more about missile silos than it

214
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,490
does this casino yeah

215
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,400
Wow that don't don't you know tunneling

216
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,320
is out there sensors monitoring the

217
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,000
ground 100 yards in every direction

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,140
I'll buy that rusty is able to

219
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,730
understand Chinese but how does yen

220
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,470
understand him perfectly when he speaks

221
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,360
English only once during the movie okay

222
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,130
Ruben's already been set up as a legend

223
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,360
as a character do we really need this

224
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,890
shot of him in real life smoking while

225
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,720
standing next to the frame Time magazine

226
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,220
cover portrait of him smoking you'd

227
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,110
probably be less conspicuous with a cart

228
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,520
that had the word inconspicuous written

229
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,380
all over it this is Las Vegas what Las

230
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,150
Vegas strip club has tape crosses

231
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,380
covering the nipples and who goes to

232
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,510
them thanks aw man tie your mom for me

233
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,040
our horror movie but we just saw Frank

234
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
spying on the dude that's in love with

235
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,070
Charmaine and having to write it down so

236
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,800
how does rusty know her mom computer

237
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
nerd genius God guy is so stupid

238
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,130
he can't remember a simple path without

239
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,260
a map drawn on his hand also this hand

240
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,850
map situation turns out to be a big deal

241
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,710
when Livingston is leaving but he was

242
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,390
just wearing gloves right it should have

243
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,740
already sweat it off why didn't he draw

244
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,170
this on the glove this extended chasing

245
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,000
down a guy and it seemed to fair yes but

246
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,230
it's actually innocent because he's only

247
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,850
returning something he lost and isn't

248
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,350
the killer was done much better in

249
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,790
Joyride which came out three months

250
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,280
before this I might adopt that down to

251
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,700
say 7/16 each Frank literally strong

252
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,800
arms this poor bastard into taking 2,500

253
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,850
off of each BAM

254
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,260
even though the oceans crew could surely

255
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,820
afford them remind me why we're rooting

256
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,620
for these guys again it's imported silk

257
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,330
sauce man but the ringleader of this

258
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,950
operation Danny sure does sit around

259
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,780
doing Jeff a lot during the first half

260
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,370
of this movie this fictional foreign

261
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,230
better shtick includes matrix agent such

262
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,030
as bad carriers and it's definitely fun

263
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,800
to laugh at them in this getup smiley

264
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,090
emoji what do they talk about all

265
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,100
business but he just asked about Frank's

266
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,550
family

267
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,230
Jesus this movie contradicts the doubt

268
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,300
of itself he's scared he's suicidal

269
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,770
sounds like Linus needs his security

270
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,930
blanket comes a girl where she come from

271
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,610
Museum if there's a curator I'm

272
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,050
reasonably sure that no matter your

273
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,880
references you can never get a job as an

274
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,380
art gallery curator if you've previously

275
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,390
dated a known incarcerated or thief this

276
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,580
is the best part of my day expositional

277
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,790
upskirting I say I'm even caught a name

278
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,620
Tess - knows everything about Terry at

279
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,390
this point and knows the test is the

280
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,040
museum curator but he didn't catch her

281
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,599
name just so we can have this reveal in

282
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,099
recreating Andy Garcia's underground

283
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,719
vault these guys decided that meant a

284
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,370
chip for a chip which is a level of

285
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,960
realism even quitting Tarantino would

286
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,250
spit on the face of wait they're

287
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,630
building this mock-up right across the

288
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,190
street from the Bellagio and the door is

289
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,260
wide open how would they not had someone

290
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,640
wander in here even by accident

291
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,430
and remember test is not split 11 ways I

292
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,930
mean isn't it just a matter of deciding

293
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,790
who goes first everything goes to plan

294
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,440
so wait you've conveniently drew up a

295
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,510
plan ahead of time that involved ocean

296
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,250
getting fake arrested and faked beat up

297
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,560
by a dude on his payroll before anyone

298
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,420
found out the casino owner is currently

299
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,980
fuckin oceans ex-wife do I have that

300
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,360
right because that is literally the

301
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,680
least believable thing in this movie

302
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
which is saying a hell of a lot you like

303
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,030
it I like that you like honestly if I

304
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,320
were her this would be a relationship

305
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,830
ender

306
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,089
this is the kind of answer given by a

307
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,500
boyfriend who thinks his job is to

308
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,060
compliment his lady as opposed to a

309
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,560
boyfriend that is just being honest and

310
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,790
happening to often agree with and

311
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,170
compliment the lady as an offshoot of

312
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:33,709
that when you two meet up tonight like

313
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,870
is it a secret that they're dating also

314
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,730
I hasn't she dumped him yet is she

315
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,350
waiting for someone to rob him and jolt

316
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,580
her into realizing he's a terrible

317
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,709
douche nozzle of a boyfriend he owns all

318
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,540
this but he won't kiss her because some

319
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,980
jabroni watching a security monitor

320
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,450
might see it here's the scene where

321
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,370
Danny reveals himself to test because he

322
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,020
needs her casino owning boyfriend to get

323
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,820
suspicious and have him citizen arrested

324
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,440
later during the climax which was part

325
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,060
of the plan before anyone found out Tess

326
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,800
was even here which makes this a paradox

327
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,970
worse than the whole of the movie looper

328
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,160
now they tell me that I paid my debt to

329
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,410
society funny I never got a check only

330
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,880
sometimes the dialogue really threatens

331
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
to outsmart itself in this movie who the

332
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,630
hell talks like this I had to leave New

333
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,820
York to get away from what happened even

334
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,260
more reason why your high profile

335
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,700
employment here in Las Vegas is so

336
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,120
shocking

337
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,410
do you mind what I said to you when we

338
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,940
first met you said that I better know

339
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,560
what I'm doing so many questions here

340
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,360
was that the only thing she said to him

341
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,560
when they met why would she even say

342
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,420
this unless they light went tandem

343
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,160
skydiving or something who says that to

344
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,450
someone they just met why the hell is

345
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,890
the dialogue and the scene so goddamn

346
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,720
clunky jeez it's like Terry gets his

347
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,310
entire wardrobe directly handed down

348
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,260
from Disney Villains the shot of Clooney

349
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,880
and Damon being the only ones not to

350
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,050
turn around a look at the building

351
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,060
implosion is awesome Steven Soderbergh

352
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,810
doesn't have a

353
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,100
batting average but when he's on his

354
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,560
game it's badass they've only nosed up

355
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,600
the mainframe couplet nosed it right up

356
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,950
I guess Don Cheadle heard this was an

357
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,480
ensemble piece and figured it was a Guy

358
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,620
Ritchie movie I have no other

359
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,790
explanation for this abominable accent

360
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,660
we could use a pinch

361
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,400
this guy just slogged all the way here

362
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,260
drenched in sewage to tell the gang the

363
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,730
problem and then immediately comes up

364
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,360
with a solution

365
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,310
he's like a deus ex machina how does a

366
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,410
facility holding the world's largest EMP

367
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,540
bomb not have any gate security it's

368
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,470
less guarded than the neighborhood

369
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,279
Bieber lives in number no reason at all

370
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,260
Danny decides to stiff-arm Matt Damon's

371
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,029
character a guy he flew all the way to

372
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,800
goddamn Chicago to recruit for this

373
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,210
mission because he suddenly needs

374
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,650
someone to treat like an intern or

375
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,000
something but really it's just so Damon

376
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,010
could disobey here create a minor action

377
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,810
moment and so more fake dissension

378
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,610
between them that is here only to serve

379
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,620
that whole inexplicable no one on the

380
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,120
team knows Danny's arrest his fateful

381
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,890
late here's where you have to blame

382
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,779
Damon's character though because even if

383
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,610
he had to leave the van to escape the

384
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,350
brothers annoying and he did he still

385
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,520
could have just gotten out and stood

386
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,990
there outside the van he didn't have to

387
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,279
run into the building three minutes late

388
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,050
to the heist any idea how this happened

389
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,390
oh come on he's been chasing Benedict's

390
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,690
girl Hulk about to rage this is not your

391
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,820
call when you put her before us you made

392
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,500
it mine this is all an act and I'm just

393
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,450
gonna tack on 15 sins to this movie for

394
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,070
this overly complicated I'm not even

395
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,630
sure it was ultimately needed Danny

396
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,760
loves Tess Roos even though she's an art

397
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,410
curator I still feel like this film

398
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,210
represents the saddest possible outcome

399
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,740
for the gal Julia played and pretty

400
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,720
woman what are you thinking about you

401
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,700
man this movie wastes its only female

402
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,170
character so hard that it spawned a

403
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,760
whole unnecessary gender swap to reboot

404
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,530
don't touch your time look at me if

405
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,000
you're this nervous about his ability to

406
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,740
do the role just don't let Danny

407
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,150
confront Tess and the restaurant earlier

408
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,589
in the movie I was on purpose and

409
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:19,880
everyone knows it so this can the

410
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,350
replacement guy handle it both that's

411
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,040
just a waste of time

412
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,470
and for God's sake whatever you do don't

413
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,000
under any circumstance

414
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,410
despite Rusty not and parting the most

415
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,730
important bit of advice he could give

416
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,350
Linus his performance goes off without a

417
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,060
hitch sure I bet the fights gonna be

418
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,620
exciting but it's nothing compared to

419
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,760
that upcoming Rick Springfield Show

420
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,260
movie goes full Donnie Brasco here and

421
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,029
has no shame about it that's not please

422
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,890
sure even though I know you as an arms

423
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,300
dealer and those stones are possible

424
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,860
explosives I feel like this hands only

425
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,089
wiped down as sufficient for something

426
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,260
that's going in my precious vault that's

427
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,420
also holding 160 million dollars why

428
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,290
does the EMP device run on mountain

429
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,649
or is that mello Yello you ready what

430
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,749
the hell is this super Ghazi both bandit

431
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,489
if he ends hand is broken from the van

432
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,629
door collision then he should have some

433
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,639
sort of brace at least ace bandage that

434
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,410
this stuff is guaranteed to be caught up

435
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,679
in the vault door mr. Benedict hi

436
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,199
Sheldon Willis Nevada Gaming Commission

437
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,089
even more anger builds up inside me as I

438
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,649
realized the role they are claiming was

439
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,119
originally Clooney's but Damon is

440
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,919
last-minute filling in for directly

441
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,419
interacts with Benedict who would

442
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,669
definitely know Danny ocean on sight

443
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,259
Christ the whole Danny recognized

444
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,629
arrested replace whatever she flimsy and

445
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,239
needs to be publicly flogged and no one

446
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,529
ever found these empty uniforms or

447
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,049
reported them to anyone be it mr. ocean

448
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,149
mr. Benedict would like to see you these

449
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:34,589
thugs have been following Danny since

450
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,119
the slot area but only stepped in to

451
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,069
grab him after he's publicly manhandled

452
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:39,419
and kissed Harry's girlfriend you

453
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,369
definitely let me deal two cars might as

454
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:42,720
well call it white jack

455
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,029
god I miss Bernie Mac see pickpocketing

456
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,619
is tough to show on film since it should

457
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:47,999
be invisible but a movie has to slow

458
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,619
that down so you can realize you're

459
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,239
watching a pickpocket but still this is

460
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,039
too obvious for me not to send it next

461
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,919
time just the card why didn't they have

462
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,720
the card again this plan has everything

463
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,429
at every moment except right here with

464
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,169
this one car don't ever do what you did

465
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,339
tonight again but other than that

466
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,019
rebuked I'm probably not serious enough

467
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,609
to follow up on any of this in fact

468
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,439
you'll be back in your room in my hotel

469
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,899
in a matter of minutes do these guys

470
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,549
seriously need to outsource their muscle

471
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,049
and how did Danny know Terry would

472
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:14,489
specifically get mr. clean to beat his

473
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:19,769
ass not until late even though the guys

474
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,720
outside will easily hear bruised or fake

475
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,220
fight Danny later on they don't hear

476
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:32,279
anything set here this is ultimately the

477
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,899
movies explanation for all the fury

478
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,519
regarding who knew Danny was going to be

479
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,749
arrested and who didn't and it's

480
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:38,879
unsatisfactory as hell James Bond much

481
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,409
movie that stars Batman and born they

482
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,239
made it the joy I feel in my heart

483
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,709
almost makes me forget that the drop

484
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,419
lines are still dangling from above and

485
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,919
would surely be setting off the sensors

486
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,659
that are back online now ah I didn't

487
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,739
realize that boxers were thought to

488
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,149
immediately abandon their training in

489
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,589
the case of a power failure and start

490
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,089
flailing madly at their opponents when

491
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,529
the lights come back on the lights were

492
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,209
off for 30 seconds right I know humans

493
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,529
are awful but would they start

494
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,149
immediately rioting even when the power

495
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,980
was restored thankfully not Batman

496
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,670
George Clooney

497
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,290
somehow still has access to hockey puck

498
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,850
knockout bombs even though he gasps

499
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,290
strong enough to knock two grown men out

500
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,180
was just deployed two other grown men

501
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,590
are about to walk into its proximity

502
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,240
with no effects this has all been too

503
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,530
easy I think we need to saddle the

504
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,910
heroes with a last-minute weird delay

505
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,380
event you bet

506
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,090
what's yen so angry about again did he

507
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,990
want them to blow the door around

508
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,280
earlier and kill him other than that

509
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,630
they're exactly on schedule it's almost

510
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,560
like the script one of this little

511
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,490
Chinese do to save gonna win from their

512
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,230
2018 hipster doom and a Bellagio must be

513
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,580
much smaller than I remember

514
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,500
since test finds rusty immediately after

515
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,330
leaving the Monitor room also all those

516
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,010
riots at the tables I guess they just

517
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,600
resolved themselves I mean deep down

518
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,150
people are good where's Danny and he's

519
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,370
fine he's in good form you requested you

520
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,170
go upstairs and watch TV he asked that

521
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,880
because he set up a whammy of a TV show

522
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,740
to prove to her that Andy Garcia is a

523
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,480
dickhole but she shouldn't need video

524
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,010
proof of that and everyone knows it and

525
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,330
it's the worst kept secret in this movie

526
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,420
cutting power even though this is dummy

527
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
footage that was shot yesterday it

528
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,720
perfectly syncs up to Terry cutting the

529
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,430
power at the hotel it's magic I tells

530
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,790
you tires tires oh sure the one time the

531
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,350
bad guys actually aim at the tires the

532
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,250
Vans not even moving

533
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,260
also casual gunfire and an extremely

534
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,230
busy airport is extremely casual yep all

535
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,640
those flyers for hookers that were

536
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,110
somehow already hanging out in the

537
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,330
Bellagio vault alongside the 160 million

538
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,920
even though there's no way that they

539
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,660
could have made it into those bags

540
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,480
[Music]

541
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,670
holy did they intercept and divert all

542
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,740
the 911 calls during this timeframe they

543
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,840
probably just killed a lot of Vegas turn

544
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,790
to channel 88 who is this Jesus I think

545
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,350
Tessa's only character trait is do

546
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,580
whatever the men tell you to do

547
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,380
I'll find out he took your money you

548

549
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,670

550
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,500
role in this robbery teri immediately

551
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,910
dismisses his offer for help because

552
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,640
plop how long will you be well let's

553

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,330

555
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,580

556
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,740
