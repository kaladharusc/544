[Music]

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,519
if I spoke about it if I did even movies

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,900
that win Best Picture sometimes begin

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,639
with narration in this case drown

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,230
narration when I tell you about her

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,670
sounds like the story has a lot of

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,350
pronoun game implications so I would

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,340
rather not hear any of it

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,320
and the monster I'm trying to destroy it

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,090
all let me guess the monster was Michael

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,740
Shannon since his name appeared right

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,090
when you said that the water in the tub

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,380
is already almost at the top

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,880
look the Liza has time to wander out

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,260
into the living room then the kitchen

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,669
allowing for the establishing shot of

17
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,680
the theatre below then cook some eggs

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,300
before she gets in this floor should be

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,739
leaking well before it does later in the

20
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,890
movie eliza figures out the shape of

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,149
water in the first five minutes using

22
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,010
masturbation in an egg timer so why

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,230
should i watch the rest also magnetism

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,640
look I know Eliza doesn't have much

25
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,559
money and this room's in a rough area of

26
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,270
town but she's otherwise tidy and

27
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,010
fastidious you're telling me she hasn't

28
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,660
even attempted to paint the walls in

29
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,699
here or did she and the color she chose

30
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,620
was named Guillermo del Toro movie the

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,180
movie theater downstairs stores some of

32
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,620
their films in the apartment complex I

33
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,359
got to admit it's a great detail for the

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,860
production design but how much sense

35
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,420
does this make this may be set in the

36
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,189
middle of a metropolitan area known but

37
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,110
this is a ton of traffic for 11:00 p.m.

38
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,060
so the shop is closed for the day but

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,860
they leave the TVs in the window on all

40
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,360
night the electricity bill is going to

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,829
be outrageous right

42
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,240
whistling while on public transit Zelda

43
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,439
actually seems to be trying to remove

44
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,670
something here so it brings up the

45
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,110
serious question of how there's this

46
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,850
much dust on the underside of this

47
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,159
fuselage oh damn we sure are getting a

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,810
solid round of Brewster's positioning

49
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,250
hasn't this come up before in their

50
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,020
conversations ah sudden generals up

51
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,670
cleaning lady at a top-secret facility

52
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,289
freely touches the tank while their

53
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,700
superiors are in the same room and

54
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,110
doesn't think for one moment why that

55
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,030
might be an issue also do top secret

56
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,770
government facilities employ tons of

57
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,030
janitorial staff you have a lot of

58
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,349
Secrets flowing through this place and

59
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,549
you just trust your cleaners to keep

60
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,090
their mouths shut

61
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,349
this door open the whole time since

62
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,000
amphibian man arrived what kind of

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,490
secret facility is this yes pies for

64
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,740
breakfast just just trust me honest or

65
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,090
trust the judgment of people in this

66
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,130
packed diner that only serves pie and is

67
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,360
open early in the morning for some

68
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,920
reason I know Giles has a crush on the

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,450
Dixie pie guy but why does he keep

70
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,489
ordering this key lime pie I know he's

71
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,380
used his great love of key lime pie as

72
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,000
his conversation starter but you'd think

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,560
at some point he'd be like let me try a

74
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,420
new flavor and by the way this leftover

75
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,250
pie that takes all the space and Giles

76
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,780
fridge beginning to look like a shrine

77
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,250
Eliza and Giles are dicks to the people

78
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,650
trying to watch a movie downstairs

79
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,299
Lyndon Johnson now a man washes his

80
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,780
hands before or after tending to his

81
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,940
needs it tells you a lot about a man for

82
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,049
Michael Shannon's character they just

83
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,130
took lines from his Boardwalk Empire

84
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,840
character to substitute for Richard

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,579
Strickland I've never met a short man to

86
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,049
save nice all the way through that

87
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,840
shortest did you know there are a

88
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,579
billion janitors employed here but this

89
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,900
guy ran up a lunchroom to find the

90
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,850
proper staff to clean up a mess you will

91
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,489
have exactly 20 minutes to render this

92
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,620
this slab immaculately wait a minute

93
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,329
goddamn it the amphibian man just took

94
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,799
out one of the slabs most fearsome

95
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,329
employees but everyone's perfectly fine

96
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,950
leaving these two cleaners in here alone

97
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,780
this lab is so stupid that it's a wonder

98
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,040
the Russians haven't already completed

99
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,600
their secret plan this place is like the

100
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,459
Hellboy facility only before Hellboy

101
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,350
still has a say being in it played by

102
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,970
the exact same guy only without the

103
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,950
david Hyde Pierce voice Hellboy was

104
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,989
directed by someone famous - I can't

105
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,579
remember who it was and don't have the

106
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,690
willpower to look it up well I believe

107
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,540
you honey you sure it was alive Eliza

108
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,950
and Giles have probably developed a

109
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,389
pretty good way of communicating by now

110
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:26,729
but did she describe what she just saw

111
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,590
to it true free access for the cleaning

112
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,120
ladies to just walk into this room

113
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,840
whenever they please

114
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,340
if you can't trust your janitorial staff

115
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,290
who can you trust what purpose does this

116
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,910
tank windows serve whenever Strickland

117
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,440
is doing his thing and Philly a man is

118
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,940
out of the tank and the otherwise tether

119
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,410
him in the large section of the tank

120
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,519
I guess they included this just in case

121
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:50,670
he showed the ability to fall in well I

122
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,170
guess this is sign language for oh you

123
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,519
know just casually interacting with an

124
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,900
incredibly valuable violent and

125
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,370
otherwise unguarded possible fish got

126
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,430
you no siblings oh no sir that's not

127
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,870
common is it for your people

128
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,599
that's 1960 system they found it at the

129
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,030
river and no water of course they found

130
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,530
her in the water because this movie is

131
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,510
just one unhinge Dennis Hopper away from

132
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,829
being ghost directed by Kevin Costner

133
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,989
more on this informal meet Richard

134
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,430
Strickland the founder of cinemasins

135
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,500
it's a lot less religious these days I'd

136
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,799
drag that filthy thing out of the river

137
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,350
muck and South America all the way here

138
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,900
so basically a man were made for each

139
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,639
other because earlier zelda told us this

140
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,130
they found about the river and then

141
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,600
water that would make the people who run

142
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,460
the hotel and lobster very happy man

143
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,900
from being a major character in this

144
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,060
movie michael stuhlbarg is almost absent

145
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,289
for the first quarter up so much though

146
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,669
that when it does get to the reveal of

147
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,500
him being a spy I have no clue which

148
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,380
character he is damned Eliza has no fear

149
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,030
of getting fired either that or the

150
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,710
power of female boners is stronger than

151
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,270
the need for job security why the hell

152
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,860
are they mopping the exact same spot the

153
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,729
other person just mopped

154
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,229
you know Zelda and Eliza are together

155
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,970
for every other assignment so why is

156
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,770
everyone cool with letting Eliza do this

157
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,389
extremely important and secret room by

158
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:00,870
herself

159
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,820
geez did Eliza get so caught up and her

160
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,440
dance routine that she didn't see or

161
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,210

door

which buzzes and beeps when it's opened

165
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,860
she should know by now that Michael

166
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,120
Stuhlbarg is everywhere and in

167
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,690
everything

168
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,639
copious cabbage caball worry about that

169
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,200
camera what's your mop head break time

170
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,700
and apparently nobody ever watches the

171
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,229
feed to see someone pushing the camera

172
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:20,580
to a different angle at the same time

173
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,740
every day this is a blind spot spot

174
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,639
shadowing

175
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
for instance I have to accidentally warn

176
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
Eliza than I'm about to open this door

177
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,219
then 100 percent of the things I had to

178
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:31,900
finish will be finished the one time

179
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,969
we've seen Eliza not take her cart into

180
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:35,110
the room happens to be the day

181
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,400
Strickland feels the need to get his

182
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,139
torture boner serviced you want to put a

183
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,389
man in space he's gonna have to endure

184
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,129
conditions the human body just wasn't

185
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,460
made for this gives us an edge against

186
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,259
the Soviets so the Americans went

187
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,879
through all this trouble to drag a sea

188
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,469
creature from South America because it

189
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,449
might help them with the space race man

190
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:53,860
we had all the time and money in the

191
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,840
world back then didn't we notice this MP

192
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,300
guy here well somehow Eliza runs out of

193
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,740
the room unnoticed mere seconds after

194
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,599
this and the MP guy isn't on the car so

195
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,129
he must still be in the room not doing

196
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,020
his job so crack the damn thing open

197
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,240
learn what you can and close up shop

198
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,599
here

199
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,279
general exposition waits to summarize

200
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,629
this conversation until they're out in

201
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,250
the wide-open area even though they went

202
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,599
all the way up to the cone of silence to

203
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,610
tell Hostetler what the plan was get him

204
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,240

205
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,189

209
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,180
especially here where she's acting her

210
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,069
ass off with no words and while we're

211

212
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,129

228

sale if he's got to stand on that

235
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:24,279
turntable the whole time I think this is

236
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,029
some of my best work

237
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,430

238
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,080
their ages listed on these ID cards

239
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,400
anyway especially since they already

240
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,469
listed their birthday also if it lies

241
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,419
are supposed to be 25 in this movie I'm

242
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,979
just saying I don't think she should be

243
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,750
throwing stones at Giles trying to pull

244
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,580

245
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,289
I don't mind that you can't speak either

246
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,169
kind of gets me gone James Toback also

247
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,639
goddamnit we already know that

248
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,620
Strickland's evil from almost everything

249
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,000
he's done in this movie including buying

250
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,650
that Cadillac do we really need to see

251
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,449
him get all rapey okay yes he took a

252
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,039
survey of the stalls and found no one in

253
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,539
the but why would he do this out in the

254
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,219
open when anyone can walk in at this

255
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:00,389
very moment I want to be home early hang

256
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,610
on their ship ends at 4:30 they only

257
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,860
worked 4.5 hours a day I mean that kind

258
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,300
of skill was almost worth witnessing my

259
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,340
man tortured see I just don't see how

260
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,169
this isn't noticed after day a minute

261
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,550
ago we saw Strickland watching these

262
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,229
screens intently and yeah it's because

263
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,150
he's lusting after Eliza but you know an

264
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,710
asshole like this loves watching screens

265
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,759
for anything that's very smart you work

266
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,270
for

267
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,650
well yeah I guess in retrospect it

268
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,550
doesn't really matter all that much

269
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,020
since I'll never ask you this again

270
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,270
here you go this water must be kept at 5

271
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,699
to 8% salinity not that she can't know

272
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,259
what this means but does she know what

273
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,360
this means and she have the proper tools

274
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
in her apartment to ensure this

275
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,089
measurement and it sure is weird that

276
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:37,560
they have cameras in every room in this

277
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,969
lab except for the one with a super

278
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,320
amazing creature that should be watched

279
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,659
at all times what's that what's that

280
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,430
vehicle man who is suspicious about

281
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,110
laundry van still hasn't looked at the

282
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,579
camera that was obviously moved a couple

283
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,630
minutes ago so this is supposed to turn

284
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,130
off all the electric equipment for only

285
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,050
five minutes that's some hardcore damage

286
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,670
to the breaker box when the power comes

287
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,260
back on will it be emergency power or a

288
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,029
regular power because if it's emergency

289
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,110
power why wouldn't it come back on

290
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,000
immediately if it's a regular power then

291
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,949
this breaker box is why would they even

292
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,750
unwrap him isn't it better to keep him

293
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,339
buried in the towels for the clandestine

294
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,050
mission she's so beautiful

295
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,890
because there needs to be a

296
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,970
crowd-pleasing moment where a

297
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,350
Strickland's brand-new Cadillac gets

298
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,610
wrecked trials gets completely

299
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,870
distracted from the part of the task

300
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,430
that he's been dying to do since he

301
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,260
arrived get the fuck out of here did I

302
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,910
do that it's not very well known that

303
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,860
the then 42 year old Richard Jenkins

304
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,600
tried out for Steve Urkel on family

305
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,010
matters and it came down to either him

306
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,690
or Julia White none of the assholes

307
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,100
shooting at the laundry man try for the

308
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,779
tires and there is seriously nobody near

309
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,550
the exit yeah this should be 5 to 8%

310
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,240
salinity it passes the eyeball test no

311
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
no no anything really in a crowded

312
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
elevator Jesus can't anyone in the

313
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
secret lab properly secret what and I

314
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,269
doing interviewing the help well

315
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:49,769
technically only one actress from the

316
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,910
help but I see your point and it's

317
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,260
amazing the amount of this stuff the

318
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,880
fish man gets in this movie this is why

319
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
that revival of Alf never happened

320
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,209
luckily for eliza amphibian man left

321
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,649
convenient bloody handprints so that

322
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:02,970
eliza could track him like a discount

323
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,920
Aragorn and he didn't go far look I know

324
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,660
this theater isn't that popular but the

325
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,399
whole neighborhood was hoppin a few

326
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,230
nights ago not one mother on the street

327
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,149
saw him fibia man walking here and it's

328
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,800
at this point you realize she's really

329
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,390
gonna fuck that fish ever since Clark

330
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,399
Gable said I don't give a damn in Gone

331
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,680
with the Wind in 1939 Hollywood has been

332
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,970
trying to figure out how they could get

333
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,920
interspecies human amphibian King in a

334
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,170
movie and awarded Best Picture it took

335
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,720
78 long years but we finally did it god

336
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,560
dammit does he love meanwhile speaking

337
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,339
of Free Willy jealous depravity to every

338
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,630
other time Dimitri's met these guys

339
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,339
they've gone to a remote location smoked

340
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,050
some spice then went to the restaurant

341
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,670
so why are they literally coming over to

342
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,800
his house here doesn't that blow all the

343
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,630
covers Eliza says you know what I'm

344
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,040
gonna flood this entire apartment for my

345
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,839
sex life the theater downstairs doesn't

346
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,760
make money anyway also Eliza waits to

347
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,320
pull this stunt until the one time we've

348
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
actually seen patrons in this theater

349
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,660
yeah but if the cure for baldness was

350
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,430
gonna give John some hair why didn't he

351
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,350
give him all his hair back this is nice

352
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,060
but it's also a little half-assed I

353
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,990
guess you didn't care about at least

354
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,820
three people sneaking it because there's

355
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,320
at least seven people in this auditorium

356
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,180
I saw you giving free tickets Dylan Liza

357
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,949
earlier so maybe they also had free

358
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,390
tickets but if three of your seven

359
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,589
people got in for free does it really

360
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,149
matter at that point I've been dying for

361
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,860
a movie to recreate the underwater sex

362
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,570
scene and color of night and I finally

363
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,160
got it no wonder this one Best Picture

364
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,810
it gives everyone what they want

365
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,250
alien character suddenly becomes ill and

366
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,079
has to leave its new family to avoid

367
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,350
death cliche 36 hours from now this

368
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,620
entire episode will be over what the

369
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,240
hell is with the arbitrary timelines in

370
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,800
this movie I mean I know the general is

371
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,209
an asshole and he wants to get done

372
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:40,410
quickly but I thought this was an

373
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,970
extremely important asset shouldn't he

374
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,170
be doing everything in his power to

375
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,640
track that four down for as long as it

376
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:44,970
takes

377
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,620
unfortunately for Eliza her upstairs

378
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,089
neighbor just recently hooked up with a

379
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,070
giant sea squid and she tried the flood

380
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,990
sex technique and now Eliza has to deal

381
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,370
with unwanted water dripping into her

382
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,410
place it's poetic justice really back in

383
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,240
the 60s nobody was ready for big dick

384
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,100
alien fish on Broadway and it closed

385
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,450
after only one performance those

386
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:08,560
Philistines went away

387
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,790
look this is lovely and give Sally

388
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,110
Hawkins a chance to step out of her

389
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,460
character for a second but it's also a

390
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,900
jarring ass cut to a Long Island

391
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,450
alternate reality

392
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,830
whoa I didn't realize their name was

393
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,940
Octavia Spencer

394
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,560
I guess she changed it because there was

395
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,790
another actor in the guild named that

396
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,510
this candy it's cheap candy I love it

397
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,620
even though he's got very little time to

398
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,270
succeed in finding the asset and thus

399
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,920
avoiding I don't know whatever the

400
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,150
general threatened him with a few

401
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,590
minutes ago Strickland has time for this

402
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,810
what do you take Strickland goes after

403
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,460
zelda first despite the fact that Eliza

404
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,200
is definitely the most suspicious person

405
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,640
in the - but then again Strickland is

406
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,410
kind of racist so maybe he would I'm

407
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,580
still sitting this because it gives

408
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,440
Zelda the chance to warn Eliza who has

409
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,000
just enough time for empathy a man to

410
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,590
jump over her head into the water in a

411
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,420
dramatic slo-mo shot as Michael Jackson

412
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,680
starts singing he's coming Strickland

413
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,000
left the office prepared to bust

414
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,830
Hostetler and hasn't been back since

415
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,510
he's also strung the hell out on pills

416
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,640
so how does he know exactly where both

417
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,620
Zelda and Eliza lit Strickland notices

418
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,180
the note on the calendar and sees rain

419
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,630
docs

420
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,430
those could be any Doc's but he's going

421
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,990
to find the right one anyway also the

422
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,580
fact that amphibian man is dying on this

423
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,140
exact day that Demetri is being

424
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,460
extracted tonight that Strickland

425
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,050
finally got on the right track all on

426
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,610
the exact day that Eliza had scheduled

427
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,020
well in advance on her calendar and

428
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,760
Strickland can easily determine where

429
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,380
they're going is a coincidence sandwich

430
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,300
with extra luck sauce and a side a fluke

431
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,490
fries considering Giles ignores the gun

432
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,110
that is still clearly in the bad man's

433
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,970
hand I assume he too wants to get shot

434
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,150
and come back from the dead

435
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,160
hey it's a literal deus ex machina all

436
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,390
the police stand around watching two

437
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,950
people dying and do nothing it's kind of

438
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,990
like the real Baltimore oh good we get

439
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,910
to have our splash ending one more movie

440
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,010
this seemingly original film is like if

441
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,410
I told you about her what would I say

442
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,090
hopefully nothing during this beautiful

443
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,620
moment especially since you shut your

444
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,300
Yap for the last two hours but go ahead

445
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,190
and do your pros and your silly poem

446
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,060
poetry and prose it up

447
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:07,689
it was the lovely little fish it will I

448
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:10,209
get reported I come after you and the

449
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:13,449
music you do that Yolanda Yolanda it's

450
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,879
cool baby it's cool we still just

451
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,689
talking don't tap on the glass

452
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,089
now they go this way started waiting in

453
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:29,360
the line

454
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,340
[Music]

455
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,110
if you don't find that cheese-eating rat

456
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,540
bastard in your department it won't be

457
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:56,790
me who suffers was a fire the Chocolate

458
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:13,710
Factory I'm with and you know get the

459
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,150
hell out of my car did I stutter I think

460
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll miss you most of all
