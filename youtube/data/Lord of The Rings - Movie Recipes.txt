hobbits would be happy they are

sausage and bacon variety because the

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,320
unprocessed landscapes of dizzyland are

what makes these movie so beautiful

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,590
mushroom caps because Lincoln may have

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,180
inadvertently the view to dream up an

water rings massive trilogy here you

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,699

Hobbit that we have later yeah now we're

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,379
going to eat a meal that's inspired by

22
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,269
this movie yeah how many different

23
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:03,589
directions could this guy go

24
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,600
I don't know so many movies so many

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,009
ingredients you have limbus bread we've

26
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,880
got the potatoes you have a raw fish the

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,040
rabbit stew gratitude

28

[Music]

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,149
Oh

30
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,659
I would say that probably my favorite

31
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,420
scene is in the two tower and Sam

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,090
talking about he's basically going to

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,700
that big long speech while you see all

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,950
this stuff happening like the end coming

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,069
in and you know going to Saruman castle

36
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,049
and all these other things his speech at

37
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,909
the end is always like at the end giving

38
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,069
me chill bumps at the end of it and I'm

39
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,659
like I'm ready to see Return of the King

40
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,259
now yeah my favorite scene is the

41
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,850
lighting of the torches and the

42
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,459
mountains and the way the camera turns

43
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,920
and the music's were amazing yeah just

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,470
me every time with your face I think the

45
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,110
ghosts are oh I think that because right

46
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,789
before when they're you know want to

47
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,930
talk to him everything you have this

48
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,879
moment where everybody hesitated and

49
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,190
then Eragon just basically says I did

50
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,200
not fear death and he just charged right

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,379
and it's like inspiration well I think I

52
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,660
think it's true right he doesn't be the

53
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,489
point it was just like wow they know he

54
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,980
knows that he has to do this or else

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,769
always lost if I don't do this and I

56
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,970
could die but I'm gonna die anyway

57
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:45,340
[Music]

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,550
so we're all in agreement mm the best

59
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,640
one of the iteration yeah I I I know

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,500
that back in the day seemed like a lot

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,240
of people thought this was just a bridge

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,000
movie like it relied on the first one

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,650
and it relied on what happens after in

64
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,030
the third to be an effective movie I

65
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,020
disagree with that it's kind of like

66
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,010
what you're saying with Empire Strikes

67
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,440
Back and everything like that this is

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,870
this is where like most of the good

69
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,970
stuff that I remember from the trilogy

70
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,250
happens yeah who's gonna be to the

71
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,160
sandwich yeah where all the fun stuff

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,260
happens and everything and he is the

73
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,790
bread is great but you want to meet

74
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,830
Polly bread yes you gotta have bread and

75
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,810
meat to make it a sandwich otherwise

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,670
it's just me and the bottom half the

77
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,290
bread is what wins all the Academy only

78
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:46,060
[Music]

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,950
a second break second Vic this is

80
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,380
stick-to-your-ribs stuff right here yeah

81
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,850
you know it's funny they never really

82
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,890
like clarified what went in second

83
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,330
breakfast so I kind of went with the

84
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,730
classic English breakfast tradition and

85
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,500
there's there's that that tradition kind

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,060
of exists all over the all over the

87
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,830
world and so we just sort of mixed it up

88
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,330
and said you know what second breakfast

89
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,040
feels like it should be hearty so yeah

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,530
so we have a bunch of different stuff so

91
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,870
we have just a real basic grilled tomato

92
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,550
just over the fire a little salt and

93
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,169
pepper next to that we have something

94
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,510
called bribe bread that is kind of a

95
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,100
grilled cheese sandwich it's bread that

96
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,680
is just slathered in butter the inside

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,930
of it is covered in chutney like English

98
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,880
chutney and then it has sliced tomatoes

99
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,280
sliced onion and smoked cheddar cheese

100
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,930
and then that cooks over the grill we

101
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,790
have dry cured bacon so those the two

102
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,520
kind of thick slices we have a dry cured

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,430
smoked sausage we have some mushroom

104
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,650
caps fried in bacon fat beans cooked

105
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,080
over the open fire and then an egg fried

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,060
in all that residual fat from the

107
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,950
sausage and bacon and everything oh well

108
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,550
you went for hearty and you got this

109
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,840
whole plate smells like a campfire

110
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,610
exactly well that's it is that I was

111
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,380
like it in the movie you know they

112
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,850
stopped out obviously all of their

113
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,340
cooking is done over an open fire and so

114
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,160
it felt like we had to do that Wow so we

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,210
were a little worried you were going to

116
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,210
service lend us bread or what I should

117
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,860
have done I would have started baking it

118
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,729
last weekend so that it really set with

119
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,770
you for a long time so you know what now

120
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,270
we went back and forth on like what

121
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,070
exactly what a hobbit have for second

122
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,930
breakfast and so you know we chose a lot

123
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,340
of the dry-cured stuff because it seemed

124
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,390
like you could cope that around in your

125
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,310
backpack and then I just remember in

126
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,960
them in the movie them stealing

127
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,970
mushrooms from the farmers garden and so

128
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,200
I was like well surely they'll have the

129
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,940
mushrooms around like maybe they'll have

130
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,460
a tomato like some sort of the breads a

131
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,570
little bit of a stretch but

132
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,760
simultaneously it's not a real full fry

133
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
up if you don't have some greasy bread

134
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,270
component that I can assess 'ti and

135
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,700
obviously when you go camping like I

136
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,710
think of beans you know they're easy to

137
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,000
carry they're easy to cook over a

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,330
campfire so they made perfect sense so

139
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,860
what is your what is your favorite movie

140
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,360
of the trilogy and what is your favorite

141
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,940
scene out of Approval it's so tough I I

142
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,580
love all

143
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,740
three of them so much I think Return of

144
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,569
the King is my favorite of the three

145
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,099
god this story feels the most

146
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,080
well-rounded that seems to have the

147
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,409
right amount of climax and just and as

148
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,150
far as like favorite scene in the movies

149
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,830
right when you start into the two towers

150
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,530
with Gandalf fighting the Balrog as he's

151
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,569
sort of flying and dropping through the

152
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,280
center of the earth they go it's just

153
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,870
amazing I remember the first time I saw

154
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,219
that in the theater just being like this

155
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,530
is the coolest thing I've ever done like

156
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,689
because it was just so epic you know

157
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,789
it's such a it's such an amazing film

158
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,099
especially the first time seeing it on

159
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,990
the big screen in the theater the

160
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,150
magnitude of some of these shots you

161
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,830
know and then knowing after watching

162
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,020
interviews that you know some of those

163
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,060
backdrops are real like does that assume

164
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,710
that that's just New Zealand

165
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,419
you know aka middle-earth and yeah and

166
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:42,740
it makes you want to go why have I never

167
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,319
been there I'm like that's amazing yes I

168
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,180
don't want to stop eating all everything

169
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,860
I've faced it is amazing this is only

170
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,229
about 30,000 calories so it's fine if

171
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,719
you finish the whole thing yeah it

172
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,580
really fits into a six meal a day plan

173
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,439
it's like the Grand Slam on steroids

174
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,990
yeah exactly exactly this is the first

175
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,460
half of it I have the other half outside

176
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,250

177
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,450
