2
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,510
so I get emails companies reach out to

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,269
me I get contacted all the time people

4
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,160
wanted me to review or talk about their

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,609
new products I almost always say no so

6
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,260
this company called Rilo contacted me

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,120
about their new 360 camera

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,489
I was super skeptical it's a 360 camera

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,520
and I already have this 360 camera this

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,489
360 cam this 360 camera and I even I

11
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,950
even bought like this 3d printed GoPro

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,129
360 camera Wow well I do think 360 is

13
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,190
important I just don't so that's why I

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,629
wasn't super interested in this camera

15
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,430
but then they sent me this video as to

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,100
how it works

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,500
[Music]

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,290
so what that was is using a 360 image

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,030
the same kind of 360 image that one of

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,530
these would give you and basically it's

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,090
like pick whatever camera angle you want

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,430
pick it in post-production and they also

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,860
made software that enables that

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:39,500
[Music]

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,070
but it grows your hug

26
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,590
so again I'm just holding this I'm just

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,370
holding this thing still and like that

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,170
spinner on so you could see that guy I

29
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,200
did that in your app app I recorded this

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,030
now what's particularly compelling here

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,350
is not so much the hardware the

32
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,270
hardware's it's nice its sturdy it feels

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,760
well built but it's the software here's

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,710
how I was doing all of those shot again

35
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,970
unfortunate they don't have Android

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,560
software but here's what it looks like

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,810
on my iPhone alright so that's the image

38
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,490
that's the image as it was shot there

39
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,770
but then in their software you can

40
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,780
navigate what the camera is pointing at

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,940
so there I am yapping at the camera just

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,340
kind of tap to pause on that ready then

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,110
hold on my face like this okay now look

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,850
I'm locked on my face I can tell it to

45
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,700
or follow this face so if I do follow

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,550
this now no matter what my head is what

47
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:41,830
stays level on the shot

48
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:53,290
[Music]

49
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,060
so that entire skateboard ride I just

50
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,579
had this thing out it's charging had

51
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,019
this out in front of me like this I

52
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,340
wasn't spinning it I was doing I was

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,730
just holding it in front of me oh you're

54
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,040
here or we gonna go do something so fun

55

happy holiday happy holiday Claire to

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,750
see you in two come with us

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:35,080
[Music]

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,590
traffic so the question is is there real

63
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,880
market for this camera and its

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,739
technology or is this just another cool

65
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,209
gimmick that people will get sick of

66
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,660
quickly and and the answer and I don't

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,550
know the answer see tomorrow is the

68
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,370
Macy's Day Parade and they fly all these

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,470
floats down the street and this is where

70
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,030
they fill them up with helium the night

71
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,630
before see the big helium tank right

72
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,130
there

73
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,230
[Music]

74
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,269
so at $500 who is the Rilo camera

75
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,590
actually for made a chart I see the

76
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,049
whole camera market as bifurcated into

77
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,400
two groups and this is an

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,930
oversimplification but I think it does

79
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,299
sort of illustrate the point anyone from

80
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,220
an aspirational creator all the way to

81
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,709
professionals are in one category the

82
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,990
other category I just call casual as

83
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,970
here's some concern for this product if

84
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,700
you're in the first category that is the

85
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,360
aspirational it's a professional

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,419
category or around the same $500 you

87
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,660
could get an entry-level SLR camera like

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,220
this thing or you get a high quality

89
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,220
point-and-shoot like this so if I'm an

90
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,990
aspirational creator I don't know that

91
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,060
I'd be spending the $500 on this because

92
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,979
it's not quite as dynamic as a

93
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,990
traditional camera and then on the other

94
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,210
side of that spectrum you've got

95
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,400
professional users and if you're a pro

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,020
you're not going to use a consumer

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,280
marketed product like this you're going

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,110
to use maybe one of the fancier GoPro

99
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,450
rigs or something like that so I don't

100
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,090
think this fits in to this category so

101
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,490
does it fit into the sort of casual as

102
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,950
and my feeling on that is also a no

103
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,700
because casual as creators they just use

104
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,780
their phone

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,720
so that's it that's for that's it for my

106
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,199
my Rilo experiment seems like a very

107
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,620
cool device had was good

108
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,900
yeah and for what it's worth I really

109
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,910
appreciate that this is a startup

110
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,350
company meaning a student coming from

111
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,389
like a huge corporation or anything in

112
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,979
fact when they sent me this device they

113
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:44,440
sent me this little video Chris from

114
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,419
Rilo I'm definitely rooting for you and

115
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,010
your company I hope this thing finds

116
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,729
success

117
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,139
do I see a place for this in my own

118
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,010
repertoire of filmmaking tools I don't

119
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,479
know all right that concludes another

120
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,820
case united side tech review I think

121
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,199
maybe cuz it's Christmas or something

122
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,520
but people are sending me an insane

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,560
amount of gear there's like five new

124
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,060
electric skateboards over there I don't

125
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,500
even know it's in these gigantic boxes

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,690
over here expect a lot more reviews

127
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,000
coming from this channel soon
