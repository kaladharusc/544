2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,100
you know when I first got in this thing

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,980
I wasn't so sure but this baby's

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,990
actually pretty alright she's got some

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,480
moves even if she isn't all ouch

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,220
but what it'd be really cool is if I

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,500
kinda flying in x-ray and lucky for me

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,300
they made good on that cuz they made a

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,699
game called x-wing in 1993 they'll let

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,840
you simulate the real deal

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,059
x-wing was very advanced for its time

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,739
it's game engine was the first to use

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,600
higher detailed 3d polygonal graphics

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
rather than bitmaps and I know that

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,500
means a lot to you out there where you a

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,059
bunch of nerds huh you know what this

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,449

the graphics are actually really good

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,360
for das keep in mind most games at the

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,280

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:54,090

hard to be here let's take the fight

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,110

50
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,730

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,530
for God's sake oh well well alright well

52
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,800
mark do you copy uh yeah I saw a lady

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,690
she had red hair and a wizard like

54
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,460
School Bus and now I'm trapped inside

55
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,360
Arnold

56
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,910
whom Arnold Arnold the one with the

57
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,190
glasses he ate an olive with me in it

58
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,110
and now I am inside him and I have to

59
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,630
help him beat strep throat but I'm sorry

60
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,140
Sean

61
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,370
Arnold needs me oh no that only leaves

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:53,340
[Music]

63
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,390
all right that's it I'm blown a whole

64
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,380
thing

65
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,620
[Applause]

66
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,300
there also exists a special edition

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,550
which I personally think lost the charm

68
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,260
of the original but it's still pretty

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,390
good

70
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,620
another great thing about this game is

71
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,450
that has those strange dos Eric

72
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,280
cutscenes that are just so fun to watch

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,069
due in no small part to their absurdity

74
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,330
but it does not appear that he's moving

75
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,849
oh wait nevermind oh yeah is moving

76
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,319
around like a little little crab yeah

77
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,640
put him in the tuba jelly you know the

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
one yeah that's the one there it is a

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,630
bit banged up by that he'll walk it off

80
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,959
come on buddy keep your head above water

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,370
now well it didn't make it after all

82
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,900
just yeah put put over the box flush

83
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,220
them down a space hole you know how it

84
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,280
is hopefully the dynamite we put in that

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,989
box will come in handy to someone down

86
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,849
there oh there it goes and for God's

87
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,860
sake who designed this chair it's

88
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,910

other like that you look like you're

92
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,239
reluctantly in love yeah that's

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,280
definitely a good place for that I see

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:14,870
absolutely no problems arising here

95
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,590

96
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,500
