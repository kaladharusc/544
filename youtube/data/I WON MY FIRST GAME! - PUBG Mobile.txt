00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,800
Hello!

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,280
Konnichiwa

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,420
Everybody!

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,600
Pewdiepie fore.. *gets chronic lung cancer*

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm back baby!
Back to play some PUBG!!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,920
Finally! You guys know I love this game.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,600
I've always been curious. How does this game translate into mobile?

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,980
How could they possibly

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,580
make this game mobile?

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,500
Well, we're about to find out.

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,930
? *Laughs*

12
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,880
What?! Why does the graphics look good?

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,680
oH My gOD tHe gRaPHicS.

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,359
For real though, why does it look better than PC?

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,719
??? *Laughs again*

16
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,760
Okay. All right.

17
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,590
I don't know if I could diss too much.

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,620
This is a branded video after all.

19
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,900
The return of iloveass2, the legendary account.

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,090
Name is already taken.

21
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,390
? *Laughs again*

22
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,760
(iloveass)29 how about that?

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,400
iloveass29

24
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,740
Name is already taken.

25
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,780
Fantastic.

26
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,820
How about iloveass2$ ?

27
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,480
Name is... okay.

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
iloveass99999.
(you should try autisticSwedishBoi)

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,020
Okay, we're good.
(oooh)

30
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,100
We're good. We're solid.

31
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,680
Oh, look at that! Graphics set to high,

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,960
because of my

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,140
wonderful phone.

34
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,060
Sailor uniforms.

35
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,160
That's kawaii. Can I get those?

36
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,200
Holy hell. I'm impressed.

37
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,790
I want to do solo, right?

38
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,340
I always play solo.

39
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,560
But then again, what if you can talk to other people?

40
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,030
Oh you can. That could be fun.

41
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,840
Oh my god. Wait,

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,340
what.

43
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,220
How do I turn?

44
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,420
This is not bad.

45
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,080
Probably like the recording is not as good,

46
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,009
because, um

47
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,680
recording and playing at the same time.

48
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,200
This is totally doable.

49
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,500
Oh, wait, how do I sprint?

50
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,380
I just pulled it up fast higher.
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

51
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,369
Can you hear me?
* gets totally ignored #ForverAlone*

52
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,380
Brother do you hear me?

53
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,200
*pewds attempt to revive ugandan knuckels*

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,670
Do you know da way? Don't make me get angry. All right, wait, we should practice guns actually, shit

55
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,760
Too late. Let's begin. There's hundred people. How do I drop out? I'm so nervous

56
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,420
This is like the first time I played PUBG

57
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,500
Aaaah... turn on voice

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,620
*voice*
... on voice chat!

59
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,140
*noisy poods*
tUrn On VOiCe cHAt

60
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,040
*voice*
Get in the car!

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,480
*extremely noisy poods*
Get In The CaR GuyS! ComE oN!

62
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,040
lol imma win

63
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm the only one talking, this is great.

64
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,900
All right. Well, this is the first game. We got a drop island, right? Military island.

65
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,880
Here we go!

66
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,220
Okay. So how does this work then? How do I get forward? Well, I figured that out, but thank you game

67
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,360
I need to go forward. Oh, I look up. Okay. I got it. F*ck

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,660
Yeah, that's not great. I don't even know how to shoot. I don't know how to pick up items, but here we go

69
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,880
Perfect landing everybody. 'You can find items in buildings'. Thank you game. So how do I open door?

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,420
Auto. Nice

71
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,080
Someone's already been here, fantast... oh... all right

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,100
Oh my god, it's so intuitive!
*laughs*

73
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,300
Okay, we got a vest. Oh my god. If I see an enemy now I'm gonna poop myself 
(me too, Poods, me too)

74
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,380
Okay, that's good. Come on I can't... I can't not not kill anyone my first game

75
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,260
Here we go. SCAR. Excellent. So now, how do I use it?

76
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,900
Uuuumm

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,480
*uses a handgranade*

78
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,680
NOOOOOOOO!!! NO! That is not what I wanted to do!

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
*boom*

80
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,860
Great. Now, they all know where I am... Okay, SCAR. Select the SCAR

81
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,500
Oh god, someone's gonna come n... *sigh* ...  YES, okay, okay

82
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,760
Close this

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,940
No, CLOSE THIS

84
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,700
This is how the pros play 
(yeah, definitely)

85
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,540
All right

86
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,500
I hear him, he's right there. I don't know...

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,640
Can you jump out windows and such? Why do I keep hearing him?

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,840
*shooties*

89
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,700
YEEEEEEEEAH!!! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

90
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,720
*sigh*

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
Oh, yeah! YEAH!

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,970
Easy! Okay, how do I pick it up?

93
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,100
Okay. What... oh. Oh, he's just taking all of it. Great.

94
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,440
I need the compressor

95
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,340
Pro! *noisy poods again* I'm A PrO GuyS

96
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,260
Okay, we're in the circle two AND GAMING! I wonder if the SKS is usable at all

97
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,420
I feel like I should just go with spam weapons. Like how would I possibly use a sniper?

98
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,040
I gotta say though, super impressed with a...how playable it is

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,180
I was pretty skeptical, okay. Let me just say that. I wasn't sure if it would work

100
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,420
I feel like I should just go UMP. And this is no way I'm gonna be able to snipe anyone

101
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,780
So how do I use meds and stuff? Okay. Well, that was easy

102
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,800
Oh, I heard someone

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:41,560
Oh... someone's coming

104
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,440
What is he doing?!

105
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,100
YEAH BOY!!! Get s... sh... poopty-poo! *laughs* ???

106
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,900
Everyone is so bad! *laughs* ?

107
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,100
Okay, we should probably start thinking about how we want to get out of here AND GAMING! Ha-ha

108
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,760
I feel like since I'm wearing headphones, it's so easy for me to hear other people

109
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,090
Kar 98 that would be so fun to snipe in this game. I can definitely see myself getting addicted to this

110
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,060
Do they have vaulting though? Do they have vaulting can jump? Okay. Oh god

111
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,140
We're about to drive for the first time. See how this goes

112
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,240
*laughs*

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
I'm sure this will be F I N E

114
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
Okay, so...

115
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,060
tribe

116
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,640
fantastic

117
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh!

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,700
Okay, map. We need to cross the bridge

119
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
*laughs*

120
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,600
cute!

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,380
Whoa!

122
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,640
Look, I still drive better than Brad. How 'bout that?

123
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,820
BOOST!

124
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,660
How am I playing this on mobile? I don't understand it

125
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,060
All right, let's make sure no one kills us at the bridge

126
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,160
Bad things can happen at bridges, unless you're careful guys. Got to make sure you cross them as...

127
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,540
...as fast as possible. All right, new map

128
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,560
We're pretty good in the middle. I don't know where to go here. Maybe Pochinky

129
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,460
Say hi to some Pochinky people

130
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,240
Or maybe here. Yeah, these buildings are really good. Man, I miss playing PUBG

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:15,420
I used to play every day for hours and hours and hours. It was almost getting pathetic

132
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,780
No one's looted here. I mean I'll take it. So how do I close doors?

133
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,520
Uh-oh

134
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah, this is the most exciting bit of the game. Like, the second circle. Just nothing happens

135
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,800
I wonder if an M16 is good. I wonder like what gu.. guns are good *laughs*

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,480
I don't know. It looks good, though

137
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,840
It runs smooth. Like I'm recording at the same time. Yeah, someone's been in here though

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,320
There's still 60 people alive. I don't think I should be that proud of myself

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,079
*laughs*

140
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:48,420
I killed the guy that was walking away from me while being shot. All right, I think we're good on stuff actually

141
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,600
Oh, you can vault. Okay

142
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,040
Oh, someone's shooting me. 'Cause I... I thought I heard someone. Where is you?

143
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,480
That was me shooting. I didn't mean to. I panicked *laughs* ???

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,580
Whoops! He won't know where I am now!

145
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,920
There he is, I see him

146
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,040
*some nice shots*

147
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,280
OH I GOT HIM

148
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,380
*laughs* 
???

149
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,980
Perfect aim. I love ass nine nine nine nine nine!

150
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,180
FOREVER!

151
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,600
I think I'm ready to go pro pretty much at any given moment. This is my first game guys

152
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,480
The problem here is that I really have to poo, but I also realize that's technically not a problem anymore...

153
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,230
I can just go

154
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,520
BRB guys

155
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,200
Oh, I don't even need to take this off

156
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,500
*sigh of pain from Brad or Brad2*

157
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,200
(sorry Brad)

158
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
GOT 'EM!!!

159
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,420
God damn it Jack!

160
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm still alive. I'm still alive

161
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,920
I wonder how good it is to lay just prone

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,740
I feel like that has to be pretty OPN a game like this. So how many people are left?

163
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,920
I can't see cuz I'm recording over it. So this is... this is pro strats right here guys

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,000
What's happening over there?

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,040
We're still in the circle

166
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,980
Oh, and I can just zoom in on it. Okay, so that area is really good actually

167
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,180
We're trying get there

168
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,160
Why am I talking to myself?

169
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,640
Like I'm listening to myself. Alright, just go. Or maybe that house there. No, it's not in enough

170
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,680
Wow, that's a stone. Still a better driver than Brad!

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,960
Alright, we're just gonna come crashing burning

172
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,200
Close

173
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,720
*shooties*

174
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,660
AAAAAAHHH

175
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,200
That's not what I want you to do! Oh my god, I'm such a pleb

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm so nervous!

177
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,680
Oh, someone's coming. If you get in here, I'm gonna spray your butt to butt cheeks

178
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,920
This is not camping. This is tactical...

179
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
...sitting

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:14,960
Oh, I see him

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,660
Got him a little bit. It's a little... oh...oh... shoot him. What's happening?

182
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,680
GOT 'EM!!!

183
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,320
Woohoo!

184
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,420
iloveass99999

185
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,060
For life! For LIFE. For LAAAFE

186
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,350
Man, it's getting hard to see. Like, I need to hold it close to my face. I'm not playing on an iPad

187
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:45,480
Honestly, I might just invest in it at some form of tablet just to play this game. Oh, there's the drop right there

188
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,520
I feel like I have such an advantage just playing with headphones. Like, these kids don't know what's happening

189
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,360
Okay, we're still in the circle. I don't know how many people are left. I can't see. I say we just... chill

190
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,100
Oh, health bag!

191
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,840
Oh... that's really nearby shots

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm so in it, dude! This is so fun!

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,140
Oh, they're up there in the hill

194
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,860
Oh, there he is

195
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:26,660
Oh my god, they're fine... Oh, he's gonna loot, he's gonna loot

196
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't... Oh, tag him

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,800
He doesn't know I'm shooting him... or where I am

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,980
Oh, there's another guy right there

199
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,100
Dude, I'm tagging people left and right. Maybe sniping isn't so bad 'cause no one's moving

200
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,200
Oh God, speaking of moving, I've gotta move

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,680
Oh, someone's nearby

202
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,860
Can you stop? YES! Yes, I am the BEST!!!

203
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,900
Blacks123, you can lick me! All right. I need to loot something

204
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,920
My goal now is basically not... just get the ammo

205
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,980
I'm a little tempted to get the 4x, but you just can't get everything you want in life

206
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:23,480
Wait, you can sprint while you crawl. Oh my god. Do you feel the TENSION? Do you feel THIS?

207
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,240
We're living the snake life everybody. 
Sssshssh... We're gonna snake this to victory

208
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:38,900
Why do I have less lag on my phone... than on my computer? I am so... no, no, no, no!

209
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,880
Oh God, that's so far. We have so far to crawl. There's nothing there!

210
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,340
Where is everyone? I don't see ANYONE!

211
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,800
*noisy poods* 
Guys, please, if this video gets... oh, I see someone

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:58,720
Should we shoot this guy? That's the real question

213
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,440
I think we should wait. He must see as, though

214
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,840
I don't think it does actually. Am I in or not? It's kind of hard to tell. What's he doing? It's like strafing

215
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,860
Oh my god. I'm so nervous!

216
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,320
Wait, he's shooting someone else?

217
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,560
OH, THAT WAS IT?

218
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,840
THAT WAS IT. HE WAS THE LAST ONE!

219
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,600
YEEEEEAH! arggggrrr... I am the best gamer on the planet!

220
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,520
Like this video right now! I mean, I'm proud *laughs*

221
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,020
Wow. Ss+ everybody

222
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,140
iloveass has reTURNED!

223
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,340
First game everybody! That was super fun. Dude, I'm shaking!

224
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,540
It's like, when I first played PUBG the first time, you know

225
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,720
It really takes me back to like three months ago

226
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,820
Guys, check out PUBG mobile, link in the description. Add me as a friend

227
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,520
iloveass99999 maybe we can play together. This is super fun

228
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,900
The game is free on mobile. So definitely check it out and download it. So much fun playing this

229
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,000
And... Yeah, that's it for me for now. Goodbye
