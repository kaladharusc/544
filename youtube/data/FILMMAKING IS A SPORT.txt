1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,899
duh when I was a kid I wanted to be a

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,390
filmmaker to me there was no higher

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,019
artistic achievement than that I watched

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,969
movies all the time I watched all the

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,460
movies I bought this book and the Oscars

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,369
the Oscars were my Superboy would I wear

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,780
what I say

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,360
what'd I do Roberto Benigni Pulis Ali

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,490
feel the played straight like Hanks

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,490
thank you but more than anything I just

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,250
wanted to make great they were warned to

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,110
be cameras not one of the big crew under

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,370
I wanted to work with the best actors I

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,900
wanted to read the best strip crane

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,580
location I want you to all of the one to

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,840
be the version of the filmmaker that I

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,190
thought was the only version of the

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,960
filmmaker ones with the fucking bow ties

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
that's what I thought it meant to tell

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,150
stories see if you want to be a writer

21
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,770
all you need is a stack of paper and a

22
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,120
pencil you want to be a painter you need

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,710
a brush and canvas you can be the next

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,140
Picasso but when I was a teenager my

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,850
filmmaking fantasies were at their peak

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,680
you wanted to be a filmmaker need a

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,180
resources Italy if that's the right in

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,860
order to make movies needed all those

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,650
things all those things I didn't have

30
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,860
filmmaking was this exclusive club it

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:23,310
was for the chosen few maybe maybe I

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,750
have to find something else to do with

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,390
my life

34
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,560
but this this was my dream

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,280
but there's one thing I know about

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,409
dreams that to achieve them you have to

37
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,400
stop at nothing

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,300
so I spent 10 years chasing it down I

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,710
said yes to every opportunity that

40
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,830
involve picking up a camera bar mitzva

41
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,660
videos wedding videos birthday be blind

42
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,460
is not glamorous and this is the trailer

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,800
I used to live in right there but I

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,150
would not I could not give up I went to

45
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,280
camp with I got into something with my

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,810
own TV show on HBO I got my name on

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,060
movie posters I got the badges I got all

48
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,590
the T's and cross all the eyes of what

49
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,330
it meant to be a traditional film if all

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,160
these people are here to see Theory

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,440
achieve my dream it didn't feel like I

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,750
realized the dream it felt like I'd fit

53
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,210
myself into somebody else's version of

54
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,850
the dream and then I was on an airplane

55
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,910
and I realized this isn't it this isn't

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,470
why I wanted to be

57
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:54,440
[Music]

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,790
it wasn't the red carpet it wasn't the

59
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,320
Film Festival's it wasn't the Awards it

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,150
wasn't the award shows that shit the

61
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,470
more time I spent chasing down the

62
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,870
facade of success the less creating I

63
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,910
was actually doing how can I go back

64
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,319
[Music]

65
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,450
in fact it was after winning the biggest

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,799
award of my career that I just said

67
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,439
bucket I just want to make internet

68
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,780
videos I'm going to make a movie every

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,870
day a proper and daily blog I'm just

70
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,120
assignment now we live in the future and

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,290
chances are there's a camera in your

72
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,819
pocket that's giving up the big screen

73
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,470
but you don't need the big screen 200

74
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,670
people might show up in a movie theater

75
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,939
so put it online million find an art in

76
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,040
a smaller slightly less small audience

77
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,260
find your audience tell your story start

78
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,030
a conversation get that idea out of your

79
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,280
head and into video knit make it yet

80
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,659
make something terribly it's slightly

81
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,250
better make it a lot better make it

82
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,430
great finally films used to be entirely

83
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,200
out of reach finally you're making is

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,769
now arms filmmaking is a sport this is

85
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:10,629
the new party and now everyone's invited

86
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,000
what's that good
