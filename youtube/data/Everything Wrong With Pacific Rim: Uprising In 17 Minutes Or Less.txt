1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,590
this digitize universal logo does not

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,969
really make sense for a Pacific Rim

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,349
sequel I mean first of all movie

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,790
specific unique logos are typically

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,800
reserved for surefire hits not sequels

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,210
most everyone expects nothing from

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,949
second of all it's a movie about giant

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,510
robots fighting giant monsters it's not

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,470
the matrix

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,029
why are you digitizing like when Rekha

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,140
tromping into the internet for this

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,029
adventure third of all digitized comcast

13
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,220
also the grand total of logos is 42

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,660
seconds and that offends me my

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,969
generation we were born into warp Jagr

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,980
Asian giant monsters attacked our world

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,960
previously on Pacific Rim they came

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,340
through the breach a gateway to another

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,120
dimension

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
damn this first 30 seconds a dialogue is

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,629
so exposition and footage heavy that I'm

22
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:43,980
now convinced the original movie could

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,390
have been much shorter most of the

24
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,309
world's recovered but few coastal cities

25
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,870
never did and the world is still picking

26
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,520
up the pieces I honestly think this was

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,780
written by a middle schooler go back

28
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,219
over there and see if those statements

29
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,110
make any sense when taken together most

30
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,460
of the world is recovered but a few

31
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,320
coastal cities never did and the world

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,629
is still picking up the pieces what some

33
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,399
of us live better in a broken world and

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,260
squattin wait but if the coastal towns

35
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,850
have been essentially abandoned how does

36
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,710
Jake keep this house fully powered and

37
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,000
operational there's no infrastructure

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,710
and the power grid has to be toast

39
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,479
not to mention look how clean that pool

40
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,430
is even after a wild party in the relief

41
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,630
zones you have to get creative

42
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,369
did he just trade an Oscar for some

43
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,770
cereal I mean that's neat I guess but it

44
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,670
doesn't tell me anything about this

45
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,439
economy at all except that gold or

46
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,390
cereal or both is greatly missed value

47
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,250
penny of nut Casey's out here trying to

48
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,960
slaps giver their own Yeager's you might

49
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,729
call them Jagermeister somebody please

50
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,020
kill this guy for me villainous

51
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,310
character asked one of his henchmen to

52
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,930
kill protagonists instead of easily

53
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,259
doing it himself cliche well good Jake

54
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,670
somehow knew exactly when those cargo

55
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,079
doors were closing and that they would

56
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,189
be bulletproof I guess we've established

57
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,290
that this mother Superman so can we just

58
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,740
get to the egg ring already I have

59
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,270
actually removed a thousand sins at this

60
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,920
work this could literally be a shot from

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,299
one of the Transformer sequels and you'd

62
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,909
never know the difference

63
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,200
meanwhile 12 hours later after nothing

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,430
happened that you might want to see hey

65
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,079
this expositional wall of news clippings

66
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,159
doubles as a premature celebration

67
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,439
cliche G comes around this corner and is

68
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,180
so obsessed with the overhead cables he

69
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,860
doesn't see the Yeager robot until after

70
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,570
a few seconds I'm calling bull if he

71
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,039
wanted to whammy reveal the viewer and

72
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,330
so they did it to the protagonist as

73
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,709
well even though that ultimately makes

74
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,090
no sense oh they get Paramount too

75
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,510
off on a bumblebee cameo for this thing

76
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,920
wait this is a Mara's primary home

77
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,269
security system she's got a goddamn

78
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:20,590
Jaeger sitting in her workshop but

79
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,390
leaves her windows unlocked and leaves

80
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,890
the path to the workshop unblocked and

81
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,959
doesn't even have a gun or something if

82
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,390
someone walks in and on the first try

83
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,160
under duress from an impending security

84
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,180
breach luck

85
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,560
this asshole starts running for cover

86
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,940
even though scrapper hasn't broken out

87
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,170
no we're really made a sound at this

88
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,269
point stop just a reminder this is

89
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,010
Mara's first fucking time using this

90
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,720
Jaeger and yet she's able to control it

91
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
perfectly jumping around on nimbly

92
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,870
bhimli from rock to rock unnecessary

93
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,760
slo-mo of Zack Snyder meets unnecessary

94
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,470
building destruction of Michael Bay sack

95
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,549
obey Mikey Snyder

96
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:49,959
so Michael snide Bey I have a dozen

97
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,220
jokes written about how this movie is

98
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,260
basically a combo ripoff of Transformers

99
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,640
Power Rangers and Godzilla and they're

100
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,019
all true and this moment is as good as

101
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,150
any to give the film 36 sins at once one

102
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,440
for each of the dozen jokes I left out

103
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,060
of the script times three each for the

104
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,379
movies this thing is clearly ripping off

105
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:09,610
hence 36 I showed my map haha G but

106
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,739
apparently it took Ajax like one second

107
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,390
considering he rebooted track scrapper

108
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,220
to its exact location and caught up to a

109
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,540
pretty significant distance so you

110
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,010
wasted that fucking backup battery for

111
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,880
one second this is your final warning

112
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,709
if the kaiju were defeated a decade ago

113
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,079
why the skyscrapers size Yeager's being

114
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,340
used as police in the present day

115
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,870
granted this girl is using a small

116
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,519
personal Jaeger bot and maybe typical

117
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,019
police can't bring that down but it's

118
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,670
being suggested this China mercy acre is

119
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,170
actively patrolling the street stopping

120
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,120
crime and that's wasteful as tomorrow

121
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,530
must a program scrapper to attend the

122
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,700
Prometheus school of running away from

123
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,769
Yeager's in the future not only are jail

124
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,660
cells couette they'll throw grown adults

125
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,639
in there with the adolescence I talk but

126
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,750
you bombed it they need to meet and

127
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,930
become friends right shut up Jake says

128
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,700
this to a child by the way even though

129
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,620
he broke into a Maura's house hijacked

130
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,569
her Jaeger and your power source

131
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,829
remind me why we're rooting for this guy

132
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,480
again Chang what I'm not training their

133
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,579
dumb kids geez can Jake be any more Han

134
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,500
Solo in this movie as this plane copter

135
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,030
lands I'll take this moment to point out

136
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,380
that everything about this movie feels

137
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,510
JV the cast other than John boyega the

138
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,250
effects the script the fucking sound

139
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,870
effects how do they want me for the

140
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,680
program

141
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,440
Putin pilots is your own Jaeger people

142
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,000
like that kind of stuff yeah but have

143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,590
they sent everyone that built a knockoff

144
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,030
Jaeger to the training academy didn't

145
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,169
they just say they were fairly common

146
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,070
that haircut just call you

147
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,660
it depends did you just call that dude a

148
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,860
haircut you know you still hold the

149
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,280
record

150
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,500
what record shut up Jesus Christ this

151
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,940
dialogue can't make up its mind between

152
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,380
being overtly expositional and

153
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,060
offensively antagonistic so hoping

154
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,620
they're you back I mean it couldn't have

155
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,030
been the paid they used an ancient

156
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,169
persuasive technique known as

157
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,820
screenwriter you need all the showers

158
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,889
you can get man have a mosque you know I

159
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:41,150
like this movie better when it's gone

160
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,770
starship enters troopers aliens

161
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,600
Kingston's game we're gonna be trained

162
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,330
by penthouse so not like he was the one

163
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,949
who died help me close to breach this

164
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,660
girl's mean but she's right enough she'd

165
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,039
fit right in here at team cinemasins

166
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,400
won't jump together be a mechanic boy

167
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,620
one is for pilots Jesus lady in all

168
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,120
movies feel they need a bully secondary

169
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,889
antagonist but to pilots and mechanics

170
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,660
really beefed in this universe like the

171
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,850
Sharks and the Jets also you asked her

172
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,650
about her Jaeger and she was actually

173
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,180
talking about piloting it when you

174
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,190
interrupt him to be a jerk face what's

175
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,820
her problem

176
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,020
took her three shots to pass the

177
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,150
entrances yeah don't think she likes how

178
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,919
you landed here isn't Vic sitting very

179
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,599
nearby with an easier shot of this

180
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:24,050
conversation discount Kobayashi Maru I

181
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,520
thought we might have something here now

182
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm not so sure I'm sure a lot of people

183
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,090
said this about Scot Eastwood's acting

184
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,530
ability well maybe she's not the only

185
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,389
one that doesn't belong here that's

186
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,190
racist also why are they here Jake's

187
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,870
hologram sister just randomly showed up

188
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,280
to the coastal jail he was sent to then

189
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,590
arranged a transport for him an Amara to

190
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,030
get into this highly selective training

191
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,860
program I mean does this plot me jack

192
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,360
except for the lead-up to the inevitable

193
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,220
Monster Mash show her new recruit how

194
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,590
it's done man not Chris Evans is a dick

195
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,180
this righteous raging Roy D Ranger

196
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,710
requires remedial wranger management

197
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,419
rehabilitation also does this movie

198
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,280
realize how divergent it feels and how

199
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,599
not a good thing that is oh yeah

200
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,159
everyone has that shelf in the fridge

201
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,449
that holds multiple cans of whipped

202
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,680
cream which is right in front of the

203
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,210
beer which is right in front of a slew

204
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,740
of lemons just hanging out in the back I

205
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,419
call it the whip beer and chill with a

206
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,010
drink

207
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,810
sure ice creams up top I know he's

208
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,909
British of some variety but goddamn dude

209
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,590
beer and ice cream do you hate your

210
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,250
taste buds you have to understand

211
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,890
so this movie now trying to slip in some

212
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,480
joke enos or is it the self-serious

213
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,130
substandard effects romp we've been

214
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,810
getting so far make up your mind dammit

215
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,520
Shou and her team are presenting this

216
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,160
new drone program they have could make

217
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,900
us all obsolete wait isn't this

218
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,130
something that Jake should not only know

219
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,720
about but should be thrilled about but

220
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,980
training is the only thing he's here for

221
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,720
and if they're obsolete that's it but

222
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,520
all he can muster is mild amusement what

223
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,170
the hell is with this movie she doesn't

224
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,850
do the whole handshaking thank dr.

225
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,470
Newton guys like Charlie days trying to

226
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,480
express the cool of 90s era Christian

227
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,010
Slater but has the role of a hyperactive

228
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,900
John Tudor character sure looks like

229
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,460
someone saw the pizza delivery guys act

230
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,840
and there's something about Mary and

231
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,880
made it into an actual person is that

232
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,100
kind to blood fYI kaiju blood is now

233
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,050
super fuel eat your heart out last Jedi

234
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,030
scenes at open table how much will we

235
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,280
also have on how your cut is whatever

236
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,000
dad

237
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,880
don't make me question your loyalty

238
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,710
understand between you his boss and that

239
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,480
other science guy how insecure are you

240
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,400
about your drones to go full ultimatum

241
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,960
no contact here after the mere mention

242
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,850
of rocket boosters on Jaeger and you

243
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,590
think a bunch of desk jockeys are better

244
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,360
than us well considering this movie's

245
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,220
going almost 30 minutes without anyone

246
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,930
yeah going except for Amara I'm inclined

247
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,340
to believe president business here I

248
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,830
don't trust the tack not yet at least

249
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,270
well it looks pretty good to me yeah I

250
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,130
saw a 45-second presentation that relied

251
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,080
solely on buzzwords and Holograms seems

252
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,760
to check out in case you confused it for

253
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,510
Sydney Bristow

254
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,220
I'd suggest it's insane to think that

255
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,960
future humans would worship oversized

256
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,610
hungry monsters but I've been paying

257
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,900
attention to world politics the last

258
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,400
couple years and it's hard to laugh

259
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,840
about also you know what I like in my

260
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,340
movies about interdimensional punching

261
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,110
geopolitical protests three two one drop

262
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,520
damn could you not drop the Jaeger a

263
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,050
little further away from the crowd I

264
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,250
know you're probably not gonna hit them

265
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,570
but that was a drop from a disturbingly

266
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,220
long distance and could have easily gone

267
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,540
wrong so I'd appreciate if you'd stop

268
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,570
thinking about Jules not gonna happen

269
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,370
Jules oh you mean that fully realized

270
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,810
female character that was featured in

271
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,040
all of 30 seconds of this movie

272
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,270
immediately attracting the main

273
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,620
character from her looks alone totally

274
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,270
know who that is

275
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,970
this is command advised that we have a

276
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,860
role bigger how the does something that

277
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,810
large and requiring of such specific

278
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,700
training to use even gets stolen or

279
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,930
built by terrorists without your knowing

280
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,979
oh good Jake caught that probably empty

281
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,900
helipad and saved a few assholes that

282
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,760
were pretty sure our assholes and also

283
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,020
who cares about those other people that

284
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,000
were likely in the building itself what

285
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
a hilariously specific thing for a

286
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,149
Jaeger to do that robot from the first

287
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,209
door movie is kicking Finn's ass Rock'em

288
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,140
Sock'em no BOTS

289
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,330
oh Jesus they have lightsaber swords now

290
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,670
me with a copy of a copy of a dildo in

291
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,290
the shape of an original movie yeah all

292
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,760
these people that seem to be surviving

293
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
right now in this shot they're all dead

294
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,910
I hope your personal ohmmeter got high

295
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,110
enough to make it worth this movie

296
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,730
killing more downtown humans than Man of

297
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,770
Steel do you mean punch him really hard

298
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,450
let's play multiple choice gravity sling

299
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,209
is a a space travelers sex apparatus be

300
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,459
a newfangled Rock projectile device see

301
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,170
an electro swing act out of Billings

302
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,360
Montana or D some technobabble a

303
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
screenwriter made up that only sort of

304
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,620
means something also absolutely positive

305
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,670
there are no humans in those cars

306
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,080
because I don't think they checked if

307
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,980
there were any humans in those cars

308
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,660
now you know how Kevin Dyson felt that's

309
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,560
a real shame

310
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,300
Mike oh we're in Suicide Squad she'd be

311
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,620
right as rain he's scared to the

312
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,270
incoming three acres and walks into the

313
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,490
bay and we cut away suggesting no one

314
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,780
followed him and the three acres just

315
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,340
landed 20 seconds later and collectively

316
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,290
decided water was bad and boring and

317
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,730
scary so they went for hot dog do I have

318
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,380
that right I have to make a good

319
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,420
connection I can't do that if you jump

320
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,980
in your gums really feels like 48

321
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,240
percent of this movie is Jake telling

322
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,930
tomorrow to shut up in various ways geez

323
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,420
Tamara's like 15 years old which means

324
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,790
this memory would be in 2025 or later

325
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,170
but you're telling me that Polaroid

326
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,090
knockoffs are still used well nobody

327
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,920
uses them in 2018 except dedicated

328
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,700
hipsters and Taylor Swift job casual

329
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,470
kaiju kill and want to know who was

330
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,840
piloting that rogue Jaeger but not

331
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
enough to do any investigating

332
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,420
immediately after the attack I like to

333
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,800
let those things marinate for a couple

334
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,480
days nobody else will miss you bye

335
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,500
sounds like soon a 20mm bushel 48 is how

336
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,270
the hell would Newton not know this it's

337
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,190
his job to get these drones to roll out

338
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,930
but I guess exposition mukhda manding

339
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,400
had to wait until just now to tell him

340
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,840
he's on severe deadline and does he know

341
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,340
this is happening since he's already got

342
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,870
kaiju syndrome cuz he looks pretty

343
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,640
surprised here so Newton has a secret

344
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
kaiju Luke Skywalker and a vertical tube

345
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,840
of water and that's a problem both in

346
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,370
movie and externally from a lazy

347
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,280
narrative point of view Jerry who are

348
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,700
they

349
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,840
it's the air Yeager naming committee

350
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,950
like the one with the National Weather

351
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,060
Service that names all the Hurricanes

352
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,220
and given the name obsidian fury how

353
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,170
dramatic are those assholes I'm not

354
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,150
gonna wash out I'm gonna be a pilot

355
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,170
they couldn't Telegraph this poor

356
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,520
bastards death more if they two had him

357
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,670
wear a red shirt because it's better

358
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,710
deema fake Wow discount shailene woodley

359
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,940
learned the proper russian insult and

360
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,830
basically a day or less I don't know

361
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,000
this movies playing fast and loose with

362
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,680
time and it seems way too soon for her

363
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,000
to new Russian insults that's my main

364
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
point mission to take gipsy Avenger to

365
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,360
see what the hell's out there why not

366
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,790
just reposition the satellites wait he

367
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,170
walked here he didn't even use the

368
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,610
drones to fly him most of the way here

369
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,930
and drop him off how much fuel did you

370
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,030
waste on there looks like Marcos message

371
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,900
was a dead end

372
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,060
you flew all the way up to Siberia

373
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,740
suited up the Jaeger walked a few feet

374
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,390
look at this landscape for 10 goddamn

375
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,890
seconds and you're immediately ready to

376
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,180
throw in the towel I know they want to

377
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,160
take this fury road out and on but Jake

378
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,570
and Nate just willingly throw themselves

379
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,550
into the Balrog pit with no regard for

380
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,290
gypsy Avenger they should all die from

381
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,920
this regardless right guys

382
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,629
yes we want to see these Jager fights in

383
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:40,920
all their glory but what's really

384
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,299
frustrating is trying to figure out what

385
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,920
things can and can't do and why they

386
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,420
have effective attacks but neglect to

387
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,920
use them like instead of punching the

388
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,089
dickhead at the beginning of the fight

389
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:49,769
why not use the very useful plasma

390
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,689
cannon that rogue Egger was piloted by a

391
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:53,790
Meatwad Bruce Almighty takes a break

392
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,079
from the nighttime and brings us a

393
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,119
ginormous Sun for a change never would

394
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,980
be good you guys can stay here

395
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,689
here in the studio green screen room of

396
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,160
non reality please don't make me stay

397
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
here it's so fake and green-screen II

398
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,819
what is it I don't know but if I've

399
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,529
learned anything from Fantastic Four and

400
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,149
alien movies by god I'm gonna grab it

401
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,739
with my bare hands and dismiss from the

402
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,079
program dude come on they all wandered

403
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,970
around a Jaeger body and spent all the

404
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,649
twenty seconds in there sure Amara's

405
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,179
partner got a little hurt but is that

406
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,129
really an expendable offense and only

407
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:22,709
amara and sigh you don't deserve this no

408
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,449
you don't deserve this scene movie as

409
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,949
you spent nowhere near enough time on

410
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,329
these barracks to earn this Rando

411
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,949
coconut actually caring about her right

412
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:29,129
now

413
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,829
tomorrow next Jaeger you build make it a

414
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:39,929
big one frenemies America said it I'd

415
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,609
like Charlie day to be Charlie day in

416
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:42,989
this scene but set to one hundred and

417
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,489
thirty nine percent oh yeah it looks

418
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:46,169
like these Jaeger drones are I Robot egg

419
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,999
all over the base listen I'm telling him

420
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,499
nothing matters in this movie so long as

421
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:51,419
we get the 360 circular hero shot of the

422
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,160
15 year old girl in a raincoat we get

423
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,019
that shot this thing sucks up money like

424
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,939
a veritable vacuum machine hot girl

425
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,040
saves hot guy from falling debris and I

426
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,179
have lost track of how many better

427
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,500
movies this thing is ripping off

428
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,330
[Music]

429
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,160
we'll be cuts from a catastrophic scene

430
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,600
to a shot of an elevator playing cheesy

431
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,540
music Alicia what did you just do what

432
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,490
I've been planning the last 10 years I'm

433
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,399
ending the world but why now and how was

434
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,269
brainwashed Newt

435
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,220
acting so much like regular new goddamn

436
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,110
I know this sets up a giant climactic

437
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,480
battle but this movie makes no sense man

438
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,980
these circle jerks are always awkward

439
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,750
there's got to be one guy that looks

440
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,430
over at you so a bunch of human control

441
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,529
drone bouncer going to laser blast the

442
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,029
ocean floor in order to reopen the

443
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,649
breach and let in more kind you all

444
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,480
because Charlie day was pissed that

445
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,860
fistfight didn't do better at the box

446
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,720
office close in the field are open in

447
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,459
multiple breaches across the pacific

448
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,170
rick roll Yeager's why did the

449
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,910
precursors taking over the jaegers cause

450
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,670
the growth of robot shoulder spikes 38%

451
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,890
of your company is fully automated it

452
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,079
really wasn't very hard to reallocate a

453
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:49,980
little over here

454
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,720
and a little over there isn't it a

455
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,860
little early for the villain to be

456
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,209
exposing his master plan

457
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,310
we've still got almost 35 minutes and 35

458
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,750
million of CGI to waste before we're

459
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,550
done with this show movie saves money by

460
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,930
inserting a few scenes from Tommy Lee

461
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,790
Jones volcano movie yeah Ben you

462
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,870
wouldn't know what they're up to you

463
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,459
have to find him first

464
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,200
but Shou ordered security to find noot

465
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,550
immediately after he left the room and

466
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,600
he was in the building

467
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,610
isn't that a secure building goddam this

468
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,930
movie could try and explain something

469
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,450
anything right here now Fuji Japan in

470
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,589
case she can be used it with Mount Fuji

471
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,480
Ohio the movie wisely speeds up

472
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,950
frequently throughout this scene about

473
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,149
the building of the world's most giant

474
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,100
and disingenuous Lego structure ever

475
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,930
oh hi Jules glad to see they came up

476
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,779
with something for you to do normal

477
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,579
handshake strong and steady

478
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,380
but how did Amara learn that the last

479
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,640
time we saw her attempt to drift she

480
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,230
sucked ass and watched her family die

481
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,649
again

482
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,180
so she's suddenly able to do it now just

483
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,740
because Jake speech got her fired up

484
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,390
wait the kind you have been on the move

485
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,370
for hours if not days at this point and

486
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,110
the PPD see know exactly where they're

487
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,700
going so why is there anyone left on the

488
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,820
streets of Tokyo man I'd hate to be

489
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,470
watching a quiet place in the adjacent

490
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,620
theater to this ball the city is secured

491
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,300
in underground shelters well except for

492
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,410
the several thousand people that

493
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,329
literally just experienced a brutal but

494
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,560
cinematic death on screen

495
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,180
sure they have ostensibly cleared the

496
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,620
city of people that do think about

497
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,269
unnecessary property damage Real

498
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,250
Estate's expensive in Tokyo huh I guess

499
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,930
this kaiju is wearing that black panther

500
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,230
energy transfer suit tech I don't know

501
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,910
how many are left in Tokyo at this point

502
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,500
like can you try anything other than an

503
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,180
architecture based attack okay we're

504
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,769
going with giant robots again

505
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,959
all right real original guys I can only

506
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,639
assume this was Guillermo del Toro's

507
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,050
reaction when the studio asked him to

508
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,639
direct the sequel listen I know we've

509
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,290
got to build bigger better courage you

510
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,819
for the heroes to eventually kill but

511
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,259
why would they wait to attack until

512
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,100
after it's been roided-up they've got

513
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,489
this race the Phoenix report but we're

514
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:36,959
still in the fight yeah and it sure is

515
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,699
nice for a mega kaiju to take so long to

516
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:39,739
attack again

517
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,850
okay maybe Amara has been listening to

518
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,110
the communications with the command

519
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,639
center and knows that Nate's hurt but if

520
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,959
that's the case why hasn't anyone been

521
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,339
communicating with each other since they

522
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,540
were attacked the movie is essentially

523
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,129
making us believe that emeritus knows

524
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,749
that she's got to get to the Gipsy which

525
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,549
is some kaiju science bull what are you

526
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:55,350
doing getting out of your way you got

527
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,829
this brother

528
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,209
yep I'm sure you'll be perfectly fine

529
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,739
with this child that's displayed limited

530
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:00,360
skills with large Eggers and would in no

531
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,679
way suggests using the other more

532
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,420
experienced pilots as a replacement for

533
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,779
me

534
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,540
Godspeed scrapper survives this holy

535
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,610
shout seriously welding directly next to

536
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,649
an incredibly unstable power source this

537
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,119
movie gives a big ol middle finger to

538
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:15,660
science

539
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,480
I'm sorry smarty what we got the world I

540
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,369
mean probably but there's really no

541
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,319
guarantee this plan will work right 20

542
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,149
kilometers to impact man the last third

543
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,589
of burne Gorman's performance in this

544
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:26,999
movie is comprised of dramatically

545
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,769
shouting directly at the camera usually

546
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:34,170
with a Dutch angle dude you're right in

547
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,910
there if make a kaiju doesn't sound his

548
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,160
barbaric yawp here movies over also the

549
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,019
world wait if Nate had enough strength

550
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,119
to survive the ejection locate Newt get

551
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,470
all the way up to the top of the shell

552
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,089
building and take his ass out you're

553
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,709
telling me he couldn't contribute to the

554
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,569
Jaeger at the end of the fight Bing Nate

555
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,100
you think you saved your crappy little

556
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,199
world we're gonna keep coming Charlie

557
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,459
Day dedicates his performance in the

558
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,139
last scene to Jesse Eisenberg's version

559
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:06,360
of Lex Luthor my generation we were born

560
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:23,100
into war looks like Marcos message was a

561
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,039
dead end uh phrasing and you think a

562
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,779
bunch of desk jockeys are better than us

563
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,820
oh so now you think you're better than

564
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,049
me before we get started does anyone

565
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:48,380
want to get out I do they do I feel like

566
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,889
[Music]

567
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:57,419
this is the end

568
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,879
a hundred percent that's the way that

569
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,450
it's done that's the way you do it money

570
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,830
for nothing you choose
