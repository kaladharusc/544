1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,160
Welcome to skrattar du, förlorar du

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,040
Mannen.  You laUgH, you loSe, YouTube's “greatest” show, everybody.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,589
I wonder how many copystrikes this one will get hmmMMm, keep watching and you will find out

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:20,369
Usually, I just get the clips from 4chan, but I genuinely think I've seen every single &quot;You laugh,

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,570
you lose.&quot;  Congrats to me, ( yay ! ) everybody. So, we're trying something different today.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm re— ( .-. )I'm reacting to meme compilation clips, and we'll see if they make me skratta or not.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,510
bRinG iT

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:43,200
Wah pedals have a very famous and recognizable sound.  WA . It, it made a WA sound because of WA-Luigi. I am laughing ( hahahahaha end me )

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
internally because 
WOooooOooo

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:57,940
It's a close one. ( not really ;-; ) WOw. Uh, it set the standard high here. Let's see some more clips. It looks like we have Harry Potter moving on

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,240
What's that? ( your mom. )

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,560
(wE hAve uPdAteD oUr PrIvacY poLICy nOoOooOo D: )

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,420
When was this uploaded, huh? What is this old ass memes? ( old as fossils.. )

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,320
This was uploaded yesterday. Lord KEK?  More like Lord ... Whack.  Goddammit. Now, concentrate

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:27,189
on how it makes you feel and let your hand drift across the canvass ( what one oF canvas?  (; )

16
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:36,220
I can't believe I never played this game.( Are you serious, omfg ) I played literally every single game from, uh, or is it David Cage?

17
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,520
F***ing weirdo. All right. It will be, what, a minion? Shrek? ( sOmE bOdy oNce tOld mE thE wORld- )

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,320
(FATHER ZUCC)

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
(chuckles)

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,440
Oh my God... ( omg in deed. )

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:54,289
(chuckles) Okay, fine fine, you ma--you made me chuckle. It wasn't a skratta, it was a tch

22
00:01:54,289 --> 00:02:02,300
Moving on! Have you skratta'd yet? Leave a like if you haven't. Hit the bell button for more funny videos just like this one ( yes. Very funny man (: )

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,800
...has installed a new 18-foot long neon sign along the Route-66 corridor. You can't miss it ( So it’s long and I’m guessing pretty hard (; )

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,980
It's right next to the Tower Theater. Once it's turned on, the sign will spell out Deli-Cat-Essen. ( Is that a porn place? )

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,040
What?  What? ( Confused 0.0)

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
Delicatessen

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,849
That is--I thought that was a Swedish word. You can't miss it

28
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:30,240
It's right next to the Tower Theater. Once it's turned on, the sign will spell out Deli-Cat-Essen. ( pORn. YEs oR nAh )

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:38,240
(laff) I don't get it. Deli-Cat. I need to scroll down to see if anyone can explain this joke to me. I don't get it ( Me neither ;-; )

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:46,940
With the glass ceiling broken, all the oppressed groups shall prosper, especially the most oppressed group of all. Gamers (OH MA GAH EXCUSE ME YOU CUNT )

31
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,640
What am I supposed to say, huh? Am I supposed to say, &quot;No, Gamers aren't oppressed?&quot; ( They are. I’m one. )Because that would be a lie

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,840
There's been no group, beyond gamers, that has been abused,

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
mistreated. Just look at Battlefield 5, just look at Assassin's Creed ( ooooof )

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,660
How DARE they have a woman in an Assassin's Creed game, tch,  I know. Women can't ( I am a woman and I agree ]:&lt; )

35
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,020
...  rUn. ( Only walk or waddle. ) where am I going with this joke? That's a great quest--hey, Grandayy!

36
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,900
...pirate I've ever seen. 
So it would seem....

Well done, Grandayy, you did it! (skratta)

42
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,960
I didn't expect that. That was good meme, good meme. Gary, you need to massage (omigod )

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,880
You need to massage the testicles, the baby oil and you put it in and out. Uh-oh.( When a woman and a man love each other very much- )

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Look at him. Look at this guy, He's like:
Oh, yeah ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( Me as well )

45
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,300
And you put it in and out. Uh-oh.

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,260
Oh, yeah. Tell me more.

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,200
You put the put p--penis to warm it. In, in, in the cold winter, you warm. This seems like one of those interviews that is faked ( like most of my life ;-; )

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,400
You know, they edit it to make it more awkward, but instead it's the opposite ( I think one guy is having a fucking anyorism )

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah. Make sure all the blood flow

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,580
(weird grunt noises....or is it?)

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,900
Or maybe it is. Category - pets and animals (wait what) moving on

52
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,160
All I want is a Black Lotus. Here we go

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,020
A Black Lotus?

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
Black Lotus live on the stream

55
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,560
( he gonna pull out a random piece of shit and be like HOLY FUCK BABY JESUS )

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,280
IT IS!?  LOOK!  IT IS! IT'S A BLACK LOTUS!! ( Looks like a hot wheels toy...)

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,420
 

58
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,060
IT'S A 2014 LOTUS

59
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:49,260
(Pewds laughing while a guy is dying inside) ( I’m dying as well brother )

60
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,680
That's amazing, live on camera. I thought they didn't have many more of the original magic gatherings, It always amazes me

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:10,860
how adult people can still be interested in Pokemon cards. Pathetic. ( You’re making a YouTube video. YOURE 28 ) Heavily played, it's, uh, completely destroyed

62
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:18,800
Wait, Solid Snake is in smash? Has he always been? ( Idk. )

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:27,680
(Chuckles) Library Cop from Seinfeld. ( O yes )

64
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,900
Wait, he was racist in that? ( fuck yea man. )

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Oh, hell yeah. ( he looking like a snacc )

66
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,060
(    E    ) Oh my God, goddammit ( YOU CANNOT ESCAPE )

67
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,420
It's gonna pause the other video.
(laughs)

68
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,560
Great. What alphabet letter are--is going to become a meme next, guys? Place your bets down in the description

69
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm thinking a ℚ 'cause it's a bit weird one, isn't it? ( FUCKING F MAN )

70
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
Girl, look how orange you (BLEEP) look, girl

71
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,720
( CHARLIE THE PUMPKIN. looking like before and after pictures. ) (chuckles) Goddammit! They're too quick. You can't just move on to Maui or whatever, Mona, whatever.

72
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,580
What? What? No. I'm here... ( My face when something really cringe happens but I still wanna see what it is )

73
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,660
You now have (  E  )

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,740
You see what I mean?

75
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,360
I need to process what I just watched. And now there's some FIFA dude in front of me. Lord KEK,

76
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,500
very disappointed in this compilation. So let's check it out live right now

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,600
( Fucking awesome skills bro. Kill it man )

78
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:31,580
Sorry, Dolan, I already made this meme. Goodbye. What does life look like during your period?

79
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,040
Whats's wrong, baby? It's up to... ( You’re face! D: )

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,580
(laugh)

81
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,160
Fine, Lord KEK, I will give you (chuckles) a pass

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,540
And here's Rhonda Merkin. She and some girlfriends invented a rug recycling machine called the Carpet Muncher.&quot;

83
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,940
Oh, looks like she's gonna go wall-to-wall, Vic. ( oOoOoF yOU tHOugHt )

84
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,980
Right you are, Ken

85
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,520
Awwwww. Everyone, press F on your keyboard right now, please ( FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFuck u )

86
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,560
However, we do have one more announcement. Please, take a look. Daddy Sakurai, I fuckIng love you

87
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,320
I FucKinG love this man ( Plus Ultra Gay)

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,640
That's the new **** screen right there? Just (weird noise) What is this? Ridley?

89
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:27,020
They did it.. They did it. They ******* did it. They did it. They did it. They ***** did it. ( I think he is mentally retarded. )

90
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,560
Is this a new one?

91
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,410
They did it. They **** did it.

92
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,580
Oh my God, if Hatsune Miku was in Smash, then I would have that reaction, then I would understand

93
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,920
This is a pathetic--look, it even says here &quot;Soy Boys.&quot; I can read ( yes. Perfect. 20/20 )

94
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,950
All right, everybody. That was pretty good

95
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,240
Had some good skratta. Moving on, however, to

96
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,720
Smoke Memes Everyday. You know when you have those sidebars, you know it's not gonna be that great. ( Like how I just spent 30 mins already subbing this. )

97
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,840
But I'm, I'm willing to take--give it a try. I'm willing to give it a good old try ( oLd yELlAr )

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Ama--amaze me. Wow me.

99
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm gay. I'm a lesbian. I am actually pan-sexual. I am transgender.

100
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,860
I am just grinding out some, uh, victory out to finish off Season 3

101
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,360
( C A N C E R  K I L L  M E  P L E S )

102
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,980
Why does he talk like that? I didn't even realize this was Ali-A first. Fine, that was okay

103
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,660
I'm gay. I'm a lesbian. I am actually pan-sexual. I am transgender.

104
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,100
I SAW THIS BOAT IN HALF! :D ( wOWw pls don’t kill me with that saw. Fuck me gently ((: )

105
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,420
The Flex Seal memes, they were keep living ( Like my urge for coffee fucking now. )

106
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:49,890
Fine. Some of them are okay. I'm 28 years old ( wOaw yAy )

107
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,760
What is the joke there?  Some are just so bad that you just ruin all credibility

108
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,160
Maybe they're planted there to throw me off from the next ( The next is porno. 50 BUCKS )

109
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,720
SNAKKEE! ( FFFUCKKK. CAN U STFU DUDE I JUST LOST A DAMN BET DD: )

110
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,240
(laugh) Dammit....

111
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,600
Dammit! I fell on my own trap!

112
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
( ... )

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,260
( FORNITE DANCES IN REAL LIFE :000 )

114
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,820
Okay, okay, this is epic

115
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:29,340
Of course you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Bob, Billy Jim, Billy Billy Bo Billy Banana Fana Fo Filly, Doug, Enos, Clem, Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Jeke ( that’s like my family )

116
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,640
FINE, I GET IT ( PLUS ULTRA ACTIVATE )

117
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,220
Loud equals funny, everyone. That's right. Remember, remember those words.

118
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,420
Hiyah, Sport.

119
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,380
Your skin is wrinkly

120
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,100
Yeah? Well, that shirt you're wearing is gay ( Does it have a pic of my on it? )

121
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,020
Dammit! (laugh)

122
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:55,880
Is that real? That can't be real. Scrubs was such a friendly show. What happened?

123
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,980
It's Master Chef not 
Ｍ Ａ Ｓ Ｔ Ｅ Ｒ Ｂ Ａ Ｔ Ｅ

124
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,240
(Laugh) what? ( holy fuck savage )

125
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,930
Sorry, what? I'm gonna need context for that click, please. Are they laughing or crying? 'Cause I would be crying.

126
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:25,000
That's the biggest insult he's ever has said

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,520
( oOf )

128
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,910
Well, I hope you guys had fun today

129
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,070
Yes, that's right

130
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,460
Of course you did. Thank you, guys, so much for watching another video of Skratta du

131
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,409
förlorar du. Leave a like if you lost and leave a like if you--if you're here

132
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:53,420
That would be great and maybe a comment. Gah!. Goodbye. That's our new thing in case you haven't realized. Very nice
