3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,730
again to the power of the Internet and

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,560
this is my rambling serious it's my

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,719
vlogging series it's my self-indulgent

6
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,099
series where I just turn on the camera

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,049
and I talk directly at you about stuff

8
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,429
that has been going on in my life and

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,920
today marks a very special occasion that

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,630
I want to share with you guys it is

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,029
effectively the final tale the last

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,269
thing the end of my divorce and I'm so

13
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,830
excited and I want to share that with

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,460
you guys

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm also very melancholy and kind of sad

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,529
about it but the very last thing that we

17
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,329
had to do the last thing that we had to

18
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,930
get sorted out was the house that we

19
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,020
bought together and now officially this

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,149
house these paintings this this wall the

21
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,640
ceiling the floor everything this entire

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,149
place is now entirely 100% mine

23
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,110
exclusively in my own name I can do

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,219
whatever I want to with it

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,590
I can burn it down I can rebuild it I

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,480
can sell it I can do whatever I want to

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,539
do and that was the biggest obstacle

28
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,500
post-divorce that we had to deal with

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,629
and it took quite a while to get it done

30
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,080
but as of today it is done now it's been

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
almost a year since we've been divorced

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,530
and a lot of people ask well you why do

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,880
you continue to talk about it why do you

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,909
continue to make videos about it and and

35
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,950
I don't plan to forward moving forward

36
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,299
because I think I'm finally at a really

37
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,340
good place it has not actually been a

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,659
year since we were divorced by the way

39
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,220
number one we had divorced in February

40
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,820
that on paper in February now it is true

41
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,250
in October of last year about this time

42
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,990
we knew that we were going to separate

43
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,360
we knew that we were probably not going

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,890
to get back together after we separated

45
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,490
we we knew so it's been about a year I

46
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,439
mean when I talk to my therapist swen I

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,600
talk to other divorces they say it takes

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,070
a couple of years to start getting over

49
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,479
stuff and I think a lot of people

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,869
confuse a marriage with a standard

51
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,490
breakup somebody you've lived with or

52
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,780
somebody you dated in high school I

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,579
think I think a lot of people don't

54
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,860
understand how intertangled your life

55
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,020
becomes not just emotionally not just

56
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,329
physically you know but you buy stuff

57
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,979
together including houses and stuff

58
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,840
financially things become very

59
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,630
complicated you're you join names

60
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,130
together sometimes you - sometimes

61
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,450
somebody take somebody else's last name

62
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,429
there's so much stuff whether it's the

63
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,989
cars you bought the houses you bought

64
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,840
the place that you live the family that

65
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,590
you share

66
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,230
the friends that you shared the finances

67
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,400
that you shared all of that is very

68
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,530
complicated and I think a lot of people

69
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,819
don't realize exactly how complicated

70
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,060
divorce is in the state of Arkansas if

71
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,200
you don't want if you want to do a

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,290
no-fault divorce it takes 18 months 18

73
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,810
months to even file after the day you

74
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,170
decide to separate how crazy is that now

75
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,030
fortunately we decided to do a fault

76
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,380
thing and decided to get through it and

77
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,010
just get it done and so our divorce on

78
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,040
paper was over very quickly we decided

79
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,019
to get a divorced at the end of November

80
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,819
we were divorced by the end of January

81
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,630
early February that is incredibly fast

82
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,280
that said even though we we rushed the

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,260
court portion of it we rushed that port

84
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,660
it still took forever to get the

85
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,519
finances and the credit and everything

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,260
will sort it out but now we are

87
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,599
officially there it's it's officially

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,160
over and I'm pretty excited about that

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,750
so there's some things I want to say

90
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,030
about my divorce so that I don't have to

91
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,280
ever make another video about it I want

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,510
to some things I want to say about the

93
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,769
last year because I don't ever want to

94
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,569
make another video about it I probably

95
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,609
will have to you know how the internet

96
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,170
is you know there's always drama that

97
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,489
crops up someone will say this and

98
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,540
they'll say that I'll need to correct

99
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,950
this I'll need to correct that I'll need

100
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,120
a tweet about it I might have to make a

101
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,280
video so chances are I'll be forced back

102
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,959
into talking about it again but I really

103
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,000
don't want to I want to say everything I

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,019
have to say the last year has been an

105
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,790
incredibly challenging year for me but

106
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,380
they say what doesn't kill you makes you

107
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,359
stronger and I think at the point that

108
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,730
I'm at right now I am stronger than I

109
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,180
have ever been now in the last year some

110
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,920
huge changes happened other than just

111
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,220
getting divorced I lost you know 200

112
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,109
pounds that was pretty incredible

113
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,389
I look different I feel different I'm

114
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,250
more active I'm able to do more I've

115
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,840
been able to explore the world I've been

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,250
able to date a little bit I've been able

117
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,260
to make friends and do cool stuff with

118
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,850
friends I've been able to help out other

119
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,530
creators I've been able to travel and

120
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,620
and and go to cons and meet you guys way

121
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,389
more efficiently and effectively and

122
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,410
next year

123
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,850
as long as this YouTube channel

124
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,709
continues to hold out which it's not

125
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,880
gonna hold out much longer I got a

126
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,590
feeling but it continues to hold out I

127
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,389
hope to do a lot more of that next year

128
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,340
shake a lot of hands hug a lot of people

129
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,260
and me a lot of cool stuff but it has

130
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,940
had some tremendous

131
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,780
low downs I mean wow we will talk about

132
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,820
at one point I made a video here talking

133
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,650
about my mental health rock-bottom but

134
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,490
it is amazing

135
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,930
now at the one-year mark how much better

136
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,510
I am doing and how much happier I happen

137
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,550
to be what's interesting about this is

138
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,110
when I talked to therapists when I read

139
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,100
stuff on the internet when I talk to

140
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,630
other divorces they all tell me it takes

141
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,270
about two years after a divorce to

142
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,700
really feel like yourself again to

143
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,800
really feel better but I think that's

144
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,150
for a normal person I think that's for a

145
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,340
mentally healthy person I think for me

146
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,070
here at the almost one-year mark of the

147
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,890
agree agreement to separate really only

148
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,300
eight months since we officially are

149
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,580
divorce but I think of it a point where

150
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm doing better than I ever have and

151
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,220
that's really sad in a lot of ways but

152
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,950
it's also really good it's also really

153
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,380
really good at the end of the day you

154
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,490
know me my ex-wife are still very

155
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,750
friendly to each other we still talk

156
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,610
occasionally generally it's about

157
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,110
business and just the things that we

158
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,910
have to take care of but sometimes we

159
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,230
find the time to be friendly and

160
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,120
talkative sometimes you find the time to

161
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,970
just just say hello I'm glad that we

162
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,290
chose to do that I think that's

163
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,610
important I think it's a very adult

164
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,900
mature thing to do and I will tell you I

165
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,640
know that my youtube channel has

166
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,210
suffered tremendously as I have gone

167
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,070
through these ups and downs I've dealt

168
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,050
with this stuff as I have involved

169
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,690
myself in controversy after controversy

170
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,480
and said and done some really stupid

171
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,419
stuff when I was so hurt and so angry

172
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,520
that I was lashing out and just doing

173
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,980
really stupid shit that's never an

174
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,600
excuse by the way there is never an

175
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,850
excuse for bad behavior might be the

176
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,290
reason to happen but I still have to

177
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,610
make up for the damage you did that's

178
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,520
how the world works that that said I'm

179
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
beginning to look at the next phase of

180
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
YouTube I'm probably going to be a small

181
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,340
creator getting five six million views a

182
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,040
month for the reality of the year

183
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,350
probably well in the next year I don't

184
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,730
know that I'll ever be back up to the 10

185
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,230
12 million views I was getting in a

186
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,419
month maybe I will maybe I won't I'm

187
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,720
looking at trying out some new content

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,169
and trying out some new stuff I've

189
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,430
talked a little bit about it on Twitter

190
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,020
I'll probably do a community poll I'll

191
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,250
probably want you to talk about it in

192
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,110
the comments section below which of my

193
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,849
videos do

194
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,589
like which of my videos do you hate

195
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:44,509
which are the videos that you click on

196
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,969
which are the videos that you skip and

197
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,039
it's difficult to really get a good skew

198
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,169
of that because quite unfortunately a

199
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,819
lot of people won't watch this video

200
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,289
because they're here for Francis they're

201
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,580
here for the gaming news that are here

202
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,050
for something else they don't care about

203
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,559
these rambling videos but I'm looking

204
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,300
for it to reinventing the You Tube

205
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,550
channel one more time probably for the

206
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,449
last time as I am reinventing myself

207
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,059
what would I like it to be I think I

208
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,129
would like it to be a travel log I think

209
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,249
I would like to go to haunted houses I

210
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,649
think I would like to go to Silver

211
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,929
Dollar City in Six Flags and Disneyland

212
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,759
and Disney World I think I would like to

213
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,619
have other youtubers and other friends

214
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,589
over for for mukbangs and and healthy

215
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,539
mukbangs for the most part I feel like I

216
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,769
want to travel a little bit and I'm

217
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,080
planning a trip surprise trip to Boulder

218
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,269
Colorado with some friends I'm going to

219
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,769
vlog it and give you a taste of what

220
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,289
that might look like hopefully you will

221
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,089
watch it hopefully you will enjoy it

222
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,039
if only I know a lot I know a lot of

223
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,330
people always get worried about my views

224
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,309
I get worried about my views too if

225
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:47,930
125,000 people watch the video

226
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,499
considered a drastic success if 50,000

227
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,300
people still watch it all consider it a

228
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,659
victory

229
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,249
I'll consider it worth it so hope you

230
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,050
watch that video as you seem to be

231
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,709
watching so many others that said here

232
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,259
is the one thing I really want to say

233
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,199
here was it worth it getting married

234
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,089
emotionally I took a big hit financially

235
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:16,539
I took a big hit so was it worth it I

236
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,309
think back to a South Park episode where

237
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:22,369
you know as it butters or Stan is crying

238
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,139
and the goth kids talk about how they

239
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,539
should hell he should just embrace the

240
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,189
goth and embrace the darkness and

241
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:29,479
embrace that everything is stupid and

242
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,009
not worth it and never try to date again

243
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,240
and never try to be with somebody again

244
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,180
and he basically caused those kids wimps

245
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,789
and says that of course it was worth it

246
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,250
of course it was worth it and he looked

247
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,169
forward to getting involved as somebody

248
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,729
else who he knew would break his heart

249
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,949
one day um because it's worth it I think

250
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,480
I still agree with that I still think

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,699
that I'm looking forward to meeting

252
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,720
somebody who will break

253
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,060
Hartigan because the time that I will

254
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,529
spend up until I get my heart broken

255
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,199
will be worth it getting to explore the

256
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,120
world with somebody new getting to enjoy

257
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,649
cool things getting to just enjoy that

258
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,079
newness and that new experience and to

259
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,180
have cool stuff and maybe if I find

260
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,370
somebody I'm truly compatible with more

261
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,470
compatible water than with anybody I've

262
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,569
ever been with before and we mesh so

263
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:21,930
well who knows maybe I'll let them put a

264
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,699
ring on it or maybe I'll put a ring on

265
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,910
them I don't think I don't think I'll

266
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,660
ever do it again but I'd never say never

267
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,379
I also think it's perfectly okay to not

268
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,970
get married I think it's perfectly okay

269
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,680
to just live with somebody and enjoy

270
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,240
somebody and inter tango your life

271
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,889
without involving the government and

272
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,420
without involving the law without

273
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,670
involving lawyers and anybody else and a

274
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,410
judge or a preach for a preacher a

275
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,660
priest I think it's okay to just love

276
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,889
people the way you want to love them

277
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,939
that's probably what I will do next time

278
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:57,269
guys as always thank you for enduring

279

280
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,300
enduring the self-indulgent video thank

281

282
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,199
and getting me to hear where I'm so far

283
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,569
along my recovery everybody tells me I

284
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:08,360
have another year of recovery to go

285
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,819

286

I'll speak with you again soon man I

289
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,050
hope what if I make even cooler in a

290
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,529
year five even twice as cool as I am now

291
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,250
in a year I'll almost be as cool as you

292
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,000
that'd be pretty cool
