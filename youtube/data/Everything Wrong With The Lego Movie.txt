2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,090
24 seconds of Lego logos 24 seconds of

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,740
Legos this is a great opening shop no

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,450
doubt but those are large Lego sheets

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,860
that make up the lava so there shouldn't

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,450
be any way to make bubbles according to

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,780
this movie's rules he is coming

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,730
cover your butt cover the wat dam

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,050
Vitruvius couldn't you give the guards

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,250
an actual warning before they get

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,480
smashed to pieces by the business

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,490
onslaught your robots are no match for a

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,219
masterbuilder this is right he's a

14
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,510
master builder that should have no

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,609
problem taking on a few peon robots like

16
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,289
these but all he does is summon up a

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,909
flock of seagulls to attack them and is

18
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,699
immediately shot nothing's gonna stop me

19
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,829
now wait there was a prophecy

20
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,089
why doesn't business just kill but

21
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,620
Rubeus right now especially after he's

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,789
already ordered the robots to destroy

23
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,499
him also while this movie takes great

24
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:53,120
pains and laughing at movie prophecies

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,190
the fake prophecy ends up being true so

26
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,600
it's kind of like all the prophecies in

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,129
movies ever only with more laughing

28
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,219
especially one with face I'm tempted to

29
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,929
say that's racist but it's really the

30
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,520
opposite almost everyone in this movie

31
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,470
has a face of yellow so this detail has

32
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,210
no business being in this prophecy that

33
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,540
was a great inspiring legend that you

34
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,400
made up actually Lord business is

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,720
correct but we're still gonna watch an

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,190
entire movie pretending he was wrong

37
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,780
only to learn he was correct eight and a

38
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,250
half ten years later you're telling me

39
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,720
it took that long for Lord business to

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,190
weaponize the crackle the level of

41
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,900
detail in this movie is awesome but how

42
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,340
the hell does Emmett ride that bike over

43
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,140
there it's only got one Lego stud for a

44
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,970
seat which means only half of his ass

45
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,130
will fit and he'll be all upside it am i

46
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,880
thinking too much about the

47
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,350
practicalities of transportation in an

48
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,250
animated toy movie

49
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,080
you bet I am good morning doorway

50
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,240
morning MA even a chipper frequent hello

51
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,470
person wouldn't say hello to their

52
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,450
bedroom doorway everyday I mean come on

53
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,060
that doorway and not the door itself why

54
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,530
does this doorway were in a good morning

55
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,970
before the three dozen other inanimate

56
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,590
objects in this room everything about

57
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,090
this poster screams hockey except the

58
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,659
word sport

59
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,250
why is everything this far bin Lego

60
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,720
sighs but suddenly this razor and

61
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,520
toothbrush or ginormous it M it

62
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,690
typically showers with the curtain

63
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,979
opened like this his entire apartment

64
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,659
should be a sea of little round blue one

65
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,490
pieces under what scenario does Emmett

66
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,810
think that any of these outfits have

67
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,220
anything to do with going to work today

68
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,479
it's not like it's his first day of work

69
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,070
or he's that stupid

70
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,749
hi I'm cinemasins and I take joyful

71
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:10,609
moments and try them come up jeez what

72
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,530
an asshole I am also this funny costume

73
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,090
montage reveals that Emmett either

74
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,890
has a flex like obsession with disguise

75
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,780
or he's previously had careers as a

76
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,610
surgeon and Archer a magician a clown

77
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,540
and Godzilla lego movie steals the Alma

78
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,769
ball show from idiocracy I can get the

79
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,239
irony of everything is awesome while

80
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,280
seeing a 16 Lane interstate piled with

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,410
cars and confusing road signs but one

82
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,819
side of this should be relatively free

83
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,769
of cars correct ones going into town the

84
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,760
other is going out of town

85
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,620
also while these are super confusing at

86
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,209
least the right side has road signs but

87
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,799
the left side apparently doesn't get any

88
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,329
signs every single car in this row park

89
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,799
at the same time how is there nobody

90
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,090
parked already this isn't so much

91
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,829
parallel parking as it is impossible

92
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,329
synchronized parallel parking I know

93
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,319
these signs are basically a

94
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,880
representation of Pappa Farrell's rules

95
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,950
for his kid but no marching bands was

96
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,360
that necessary for an eight-year-old or

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,670
at all

98

you've been at work for five hours and

100

it's already dark the hell kind of book

101
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,680
place do you live anyway also five hours

102
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,879
later and they're already calling it a

103
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,500
day but they just got there and started

104
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,480
singing damn and it's work schedule is

105
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,430
badass in the waning hours of the work

106
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,810
day the instructions tell the Lego

107
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,549
workers to create an elaborate ballet of

108
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,290
construction equipment oh who knew LEGO

109
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,670
pieces could be linked to the clown or

110
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,609
even electrified well I'm gonna have to

111
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,760
report

I'll take two sins off for the Solaris

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,280
nests but then add one back for

115
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,810
wyldstyle taking off her mask for any

116
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,280
reason during this mission I don't mind

117
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,570
this kid imagining all this happening

118
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,160
but just how deep to his dad's Lego

119
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,810
buildings go anyway considering that we

120
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,550
later learn emit as a fraud and even the

121
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,320
prophecy is a fraud this crazy magic

122
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,030
flashback vision thing Emmet hands when

123
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,990
first touching the piece of resistance

124
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,330
seems kind of stupid right the piece of

125
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,260
resistance

126
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,790
animated Liam Neeson character isn't

127
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,380
killing anyone in the scene just three

128
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,970
days before president of business is

129
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,010
going to use the croco to end the world

130
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,110
president business is going to end the

131
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,330
war bad cop goes all Hagrid on our asses

132
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,500
and says more than he should which

133
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,910
allows our hero to kick-start the plot

134
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,840
you see when you say the other guy I go

135
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,530
characters go to great lengths to

136
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,030
describe how aggressively average and

137
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,770
inconsequential Emmet is also this

138
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,940
interview footage of construction

139
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,560
workers was expertly shot and edited for

140
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,360
maximum and that humiliation you know

141
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,940
he's just sort of also bad cops video

142
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,290
investigation somehow led him to the

143
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,030
coffee shop to talk to the barista it's

144
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,680
at this point I wonder how did Emmet get

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
the piece of resistance glued to his

146
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,470
back the only person in this universe

147
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,000
with the kragle is lowered business yeah

148
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,740
sure we know the kid Finn did this in

149
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,210
the real world but glue is supposed to

150
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,490
be bad remember wyldstyle is such a

151
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,170
lethal assassin here makes me wonder why

152
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,610
they need it doesn't heroes and a plan

153
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,930
at the end of this movie instead of just

154
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,580
sending in wild style and letting her go

155
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,260
all beserker and the enemy also with

156
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,730
wild style is this awesome at fighting

157
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,230
then why did she care that Emmet saw her

158
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,730
earlier couldn't she have just run down

159
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,930
to get the piece of resistance and

160
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,310
whooshed on out of there and how did

161
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,300
Emmett make his way up to ground level

162
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,950
without wyldstyle noticing and just

163
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,330
taking the piece while he's passed out I

164
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,230
realize we're sending a kid's

165
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,700
imagination here but this is some simple

166
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,470
imagination this one hack somehow

167
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,360
releases Emmitt from both shackles cut

168
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,450
it off on them now or whatever you can

169
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,100
good cops should be reserved to

170
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,750
interrogations right otherwise he's just

171
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,010
giving his crew mixed messages but

172
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,330
didn't Vitruvius get kicked off the

173
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,740
cliff into the lava the beginning of

174
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,970
this movie are you telling me he had a

175
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,590
Gandalf like experience where he fell to

176
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,090
his death but became Vitruvius the white

177
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,800
for virtually no reason at all the Attic

178
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,650
latter falls down to give em at a ramp

179
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,880
why didn't you just do that in the first

180
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,470
place where are we

181
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,090
titles on screen responding to an in

182
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,380
movie characters question for the

183
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,180
viewing audience is benefit you ruined

184
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,140
the prophecy

185
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,000
hang on wyldstyle I'd say if the

186
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,560
prophecy allowed Emmitt to collect the

187
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,970
piece of resistance it's the prophecy

188
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,280
that's up here also you're the one that

189
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,360
maybe you're not the one but you'll

190
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,530
totally be the one by the end of the

191
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,210
movie cliche and we search for the piece

192
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,520
of resistance the only thing that can

193
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,080
stop the kragle they're telling me the

194
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,400
original cap to the super glue is the

195
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,810
only thing and all the varied Lego

196
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,430
kingdoms that can cover and stop the

197
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,840
flow of super glue from the superglue

198
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,670
container I say you assholes are trying

199
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,240
hard enough

200
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,860
who's going to use the kragle to end the

201
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,310
world in three days yeah but it's only

202
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,230
Taco Tuesday in bricksburg panels Lord

203
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,550
business gonna gather everyone for

204
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,470
destruction in the other worlds also why

205
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,850
if you hadn't read the script with

206
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,440
something as scrumptious as Taco Tuesday

207
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,880
tip off your spidey senses this entire

208
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,680
movie is made M it out to be so common

209
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,180
in a sea of commonality that nobody

210
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,980
remembers it but physically everyone's

211
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,510
got a thing like different facial hair

212
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,440
or markings different hair altogether so

213
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,610
basically this is the Star Trek's

214
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,710
feature or the Planet of the Apes kolima

215
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,750
I won't test it on you I'll do it on

216
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,030
your parents Lord business imports bad

217
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,740
cops parents entire house instead of

218
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,850
just abducting the two of them and

219
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,260
crackling them to a random Lego piece

220
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,880
removing good cops facial features

221
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,590
removes the entire good cop personality

222
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,480
from this guy somehow also though as an

223
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,790
aside is lego sex the most basic thing

224
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,620
ever or what hey my rounded peg would

225
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,120
seem to fit in year-round at home come

226
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,770
let us attach and unattach ourselves

227
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,120
together repeatedly for a few minutes

228
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,920
damn this kid even managed to imagine a

229
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
hooker in the saloon this kid's like

230
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,700
eight right eat me upstairs in ten

231
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,890
seconds this is hilarious but why would

232
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,480
the octant title card company make

233
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,010
silent title cards for what is the

234
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,570
protagonists adventure more importantly

235
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,580
why make title cards for anything your

236
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,820
mind is already so prodigiously empty

237
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,740
that there is nothing in it to clear

238
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,600
away in the first place is this the

239
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,890
silliest movie Morgan Freeman's ever

240
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,050
appeared in no he was also in Ted too

241
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,650
now you see

242
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,990
me too and Dolphin Tale - I know a crazy

243
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,600
right still true prophecy chosed you in

244
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,960
it

245
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,430
we know that wizard Vitruvius is making

246
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,810
this up as he goes along but why the

247
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,340
certainty about Emmett's usefulness

248
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,389
can't he just take the piece of

249
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,039
resistance and with the help of all the

250
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,389
other remaining master-builders can't

251
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,539
the kragle himself all you have to do is

252
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,699
to believe all you have to do is believe

253
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,330
please shame

254
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,539
draw a cowboy hat on him but wait don't

255
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,830
have the people in the saloon have a

256
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,300
cowboy hat and isn't the point that

257
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,830
everyone has the same face so common

258
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,039
hats wouldn't make a difference after

259
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,449
hundreds of shots by his minions at the

260
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,010
hang-glider bad cop takes them out with

261
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,720
one shot these robot cops should just be

262
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,310
stormtrooper figures rather than be

263
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,600
propelled forward after hitting this

264
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,979
train the heroes conveniently goes

265
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,720
straight up and conveniently land on top

266
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,889
of the convenient train that is

267
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,960
convenient Oh No did bad cop actually

268
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,340
get on these train tracks knowing that

269
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,630
the heroes would eventually jump on this

270
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,460
train and what kind of xxx state of the

271
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,530
union is this anyway again why not do

272
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,220
this in the first place rest in pieces

273
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,900
way to make this yet another Batman

274
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,610
scene involving Ra's al Ghul and a

275
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,080
speeding train well they threw and

276
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,660
Lucius Fox somehow to Batman when the

277
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,220
does Emmet know who Batman is

278
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,139
he lives in bricksburg remember a place

279
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,520
where everything is generic and the only

280
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,020
thing on the TV is where are my pants

281
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,580
you think president business is gonna

282
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,229
allow a vigilante superhero to be shown

283
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,950
on public media so if this universe is

284
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,270
based on the playset that the kid is

285
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,830
using in the real world where is cloud

286
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,930
cuckoo-land big and complicated enough

287
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,310
that the dad would have noticed and it's

288
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,570
obviously that jacent to one of the

289
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,130
traditional sets no bushes moustaches I

290
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,510
understand the rest but why the war on

291
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,250
moustaches some of that painted right on

292
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,720
their face and they can't help it of

293
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,250
course we saw Emmett shave his face a

294
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,630
while back so what do I know what's real

295
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,760
the special will now give an eloquent

296
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,680
speech the fact that anybody who knows

297
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,029
Emmett at this point thinks this will go

298
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,029
well Church that shark is out of water

299
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,560
that doesn't compute at all

300
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,300
why implement a shark defense system on

301
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,160
the infinity of floor miles above sea

302
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
level and you know see and strange

303
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,709
dangerous relics that entrap snap and

304
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,250
zap

305
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,839
how are those used against you again

306
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,400
every single part of this story shows

307
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,810
you getting your asses kicked by all the

308
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,339
dangerous stuff in the tower but here

309
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,570
the relics are just sitting on their

310
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,220
pedestals being used by nobody large

311
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,260
idea have

312
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,320
that'd be better than the ideas of 100

313
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,630
of our fallen masterbuilder brothers

314
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,190
well Emmett has the piece of resistance

315
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,110
right something you didn't have when you

316
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,520
broke into Lord business's tower on the

317
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,410
last attempt Jesus why did they even try

318
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,520
that time without the single most

319
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,930
important relic they needed and an inn

320
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,430
company had to ride a Rainbow Bridge up

321
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,120
to cloud cuckoo-land

322
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,770
but this pirate drops out of it into the

323
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,030
water with no sign of any kind of

324
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,500
rainbow bridge in sight is the Rainbow

325
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,270
Bridge temporary or does the movie just

326
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,550
not get about cloud cuckoo rules well at

327
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,170
least it can't get any worse every time

328
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,610
a movie character says this an angel

329
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,680
gets its wings ripped off by a god-sized

330
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,310
pair of pliers huge ass blinking

331
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,720
tracking device goes unnoticed by

332
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,400
everyone in this entire movie until now

333
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,970
because of course it does

334
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,300
dang it

335
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,370
Wow in a total dick move Wonder Woman

336
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,660
must have perked her jet literally on

337
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,350
top of the Batmobile I guess Lego

338
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,970
Superman doesn't have the power to just

339
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,590
end this entire attack by bad cop right

340
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,980
now ready for that hilarious moment

341
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,960
interrupted by logic it was a basketball

342
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,700
they didn't have to be ready for it it's

343
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,290
been harmless you were part of a group

344
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,580
that was just giving em it for being

345
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,410
useless and then you go and do this if

346
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,360
you let go Shaq you're a fraud you're no

347
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,020
more master builder than em it is it's

348
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,280
win to stuff like this stop Superman

349
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,840
isn't this the type of thing that stops

350
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,230
Hulk and dream catchers in case we take

351
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,670
a nap Morgan Freeman dream catcher

352
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,530
references forcibly inserted into the

353
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,240
tubes of this lego movie you must

354
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,180
embrace what is special about you

355
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,070
but that's nothing he's an instructions

356
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,660
following loser that's the entire point

357
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,070
of the movie actually that even and

358
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,990
nobody's ideas are worthwhile but here

359
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,400
you suggest he's still special in some

360
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,110
way despite numerous moments proving he

361
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,700
is not and you knowing you made the

362
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,780
whole thing up in the first place in

363
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,090
Lego world clowns can get so fire damage

364
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,590
they crash into the sea which sort of

365
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,090
makes them not clouds but whatever

366
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,770
science doesn't exist in this movie it's

367
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,270
not like I need dr. Tyson's help here I

368
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,680
got this one doc like Wonder Woman

369
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,180
couldn't take out all these fools in her

370
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,680
own and let's not forget we're in this

371
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,450
situation because Superman god damned

372
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,640
Superman was defeated by bubblegum so

373
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,860
wait no every time waters been shown in

374
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,330
this movie it has been flat sheets or

375
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,310
little one pieces of blue Legos so them

376
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,660
traveling through this sea of actual

377
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,520
water is a freaking lie I don't care if

378
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,810
it's a little kids imagination play by

379
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,670
our rules movie then after a few leaks

380
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,120
the fucking thing explodes explodes it

381
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,010
loaded instead of sinking holes in a sub

382
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,070
caused an explosion that just happened

383
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,260
survivors sensors can see into the water

384
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,550
but literally can't see through a

385
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,110
double-decker couch how do they get

386
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,210
Superman out of the gum pile whoever and

387
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,350
whatever touched it should have also

388
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,029
been stuck like Green Lantern and it's

389
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,260
much-maligned double decker couch

390
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,029
actually saves the day but how did these

391
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,830
assholes fit in the seat cushions this

392
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,150
isn't the Millennium Falcon's secret

393
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,470
compartments here you have to do some

394
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,910
very simple things with the scale of the

395
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,440
human beings in this world to make this

396
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,860
work

397
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,870
pirate Lego Lex machina also pirate guy

398
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,339
goes on to explain he came back because

399
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:13,930
he watched Lord businesses forces

400
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,370
totally overlook the double-decker couch

401
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,440
okay Thor whatever but you were leaving

402
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,210
you said why were you even still around

403
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,830
to keep an eye on a floating couch you

404
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,690
like left but actually hid behind a rock

405
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,190
and spied on everything I guess the

406
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,660
little detail of a true B is drinking

407
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,950
from the couch cup here is just so

408
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,300
goddamn hilarious to me that I must

409
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,580
remove the sin it's follow the

410
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,529
instructions and it says this and it

411
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:33,520
definitely sounds brilliant

412
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,260
but then their plan ultimately involves

413
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,760
very little instruction following and a

414
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,950
metric asked ton of improvisation I mean

415
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,870
by follow the instructions M it mostly

416
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,940
means draw up a plan in advance which is

417
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,930
actually a totally different thing

418
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,810
somebody get me some markers some

419
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,250
construction paper wait aren't they

420
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,720
supposed to be avoiding any adhesives

421
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,339
yeah but according to your precious

422
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,560
instructions he made that with markers

423
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,089
construction paper and glitter glue

424
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,890
really apparently Emmett's planned

425
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,330
spaceship that looks like president

426
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,680
businesses spaceships calls for a

427
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,330
hyperdrive they got to this point in the

428
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,279
Lego world by train horseback and a

429
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,020
floating double-decker couch so a

430
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,670
hyperdrive is not needed to get to

431
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,470
president businesses tower but the movie

432
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,029
wanted to shoehorn in a Star Wars moment

433
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,500
and so we get this Batman is about to

434
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,970
jump on the Millennium Falcon here which

435
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,860
as you see includes Lando Calrissian

436
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,330
but because Lando is actually voiced by

437
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,040
Billy Dee Williams that also includes

438
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,420
Harvey Dent until Tommy Lee Jones

439
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,850
replaces him mid-flight what Han and

440
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,050
everybody be doing and yet another

441
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,029
asteroid with yet another space slug I

442
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,650
demand answers for this parody that is

443
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,790
both hilarious and entertaining but

444
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,830
sinful also is the kid flashing back

445
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,360
like the movie is right now does his

446
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,490
mind work like a family Guy episode step

447
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:36,940
4

448
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,830
Benny and metal beard who sneak their

449
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,450
way into the master control room metal

450
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,400
beard the largest noisiest loudest

451
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,959
motherfucker on your team and you sent

452
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,790
him on the sneak mission hot jesus this

453
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,050
plan is really stupid

454
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,339
metal beard is suddenly a goddamn

455
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:49,810
transformer and can turn into an object

456
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,089
one-tenth his size like a copy machine

457
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,010
this is all new information presented as

458
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,459
fact

459
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,780
not only is the first thought robot

460
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,889
soldiers have when they see

461
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,869
copier to photocopy their asses but

462
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,850
metal beer transformed into a functional

463
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,129
copy machine really that was awesome

464
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,350
first law of the sea one of the rules

465
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,999
has never released a Kraken and if

466
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,410
you're one of others maybe you take that

467
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,029
one step further and never again release

468
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,049
a Clash of the Titans

469
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,149
step 5 but Rubeus will provide lookout

470
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:15,160
make sure we're not being followed okay

471
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,779
this is a funny moment but everything

472
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,220
else about Emmett's plan actually makes

473
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,049
sense so why through in this useless job

474
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,179
four blind old RIT I move that we freeze

475
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,829
the universe can I get a second on that

476
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,720
why the balls does Lord business need

477
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,249
board approval to freeze the universe

478
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,049
it's either an evil secret plan or

479
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:29,919
something that would have been planned

480
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,449
for months not a rubber-stamp the day

481
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,929
before it happens what do you mean you

482
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,999
have always been a robot despite large

483
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,889
reams of up being robots Emmett and

484
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,209
wyldstyle managed to escape this

485
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,739
situation I just realized this is the

486
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,179
first of two blockbusters where Chris

487
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:47,619
Pratt's character gets himself out of a

488
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:49,389
jam with a comical music dance number

489
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,919
and now I feel like there almost has to

490
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,689
be a Jurassic world deleted scene of him

491
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,009
in the Raptor Bros popping and locking

492
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,079
that night in the city one you thought I

493
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,790
was the special damn this kid's

494
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,350
imagination sure has gotten dramatic all

495
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,639
of a sudden this is a tremendously

496
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,559
complex fantasy hey what are you two

497
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,269
losers talking about did the plan call

498
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,100
for Batman to be here right now or is he

499
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,600
just being Batman doing whatever he

500
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,009
wants how might this screw up Emmett's

501
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,100
plan does Batman care this business

502
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,660
leads a coordinated attack on all the

503
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,309
heroes at the same time leading us to

504
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,749
believe he had snipped out the plot and

505
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,470
was ready for it

506
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,029
but if it hadn't paused for this line

507
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,439
everything would have been different the

508
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,610
next thing we minutes of this movie is

509
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,199
solely because the hero and villain both

510
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,610
have a thing for dramatic timing the

511
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,919
prophecy I made it up Vitruvius tells

512
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,509
Emmet this when he's about to die rather

513
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,399
than days ago but honestly the real bull

514
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,110
fears that this prophecy was so specific

515
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,699
and everything about it except Emmet

516
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,290
turns out to be true except the Emmet

517
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,970
part even turns out to be true kind of

518
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,949
in that Kung Fu Panda way what I'm about

519
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:41,889
to tell you will change the course of

520
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:49,360
history the electric shocker 100

521
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,189
Mississippi no problem villains it's a

522
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:52,600
needlessly long timer for people getting

523
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,039
killed and doesn't even bother to stay

524
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,629
around to witness it and terminate

525
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,429
everyone okay so Papa Pharoah wants to

526
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,049
glue everything that already exists in

527
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:00,939
place and that's explained but why would

528
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:01,899
he terminate all the master-builders

529
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,549
that are providing instructions for the

530
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:04,929
stuff that's still being built like

531
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,699
there are skyscrapers in bricksburg that

532
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,590
are still under construction right

533
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,140
and ghost Vitruvius the effects in

534
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,460
conceit of this movie are brilliant

535
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,020
taking Legos and making them move on

536
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,279
their own in their own little universe

537
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,990
so why are we getting these wink wink

538
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,060
moments now like 70% into the movie

539
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,970
who wants a taco half the happy

540
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,290
responders to this question are in

541
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,850
sombreros that's racist

542
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,160
does anyone have any ideas I do let's

543
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,450
get Superman to save the day

544
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,940
Benny send this out to everyone in the

545
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,529
universe I know most of the droid

546
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,029
I mean robot arming is with business

547
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,589
right now but there should be someone

548
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,940
left behind in the elephants right at

549
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,930
least the ones that were previously

550
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,020
directing and watching this show and he

551
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,880
was just like all of you a face in the

552
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,860
crowd the speech is awesome but where

553
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,089
the hell did she get all this backstory

554
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,350
footage of Emmet to run under this

555
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,910
emergency broadcast some of this

556
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,680
violates the First Amendment I think I

557
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,570
mean this here says security footage but

558
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,220
it's emitted his own apartment does this

559
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,050
society film every residents personal

560
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,790
actions in their apartments I used to

561
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,580
think they follow us funny that they got

562
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,200
the town crier to read this news but

563
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,580
this is being shown concurrent with

564
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,380
wyldstyle speech so how are they getting

565
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,490
this news in real time

566
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,020
wait there's a security footage up the

567
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,970
goddamn double-decker couch escape okay

568
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,890
now who filmed this where is camera

569
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,600
here's more security cam footage to the

570
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,920
feels like just previous movie scene

571
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,689
footage degraded to look like security

572
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,760
footage I mean the bad guys had this on

573
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,780
camera you never would have gotten away

574
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,400
with it right the kragle hoses politely

575
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,170
pause their destruction of this town so

576
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,429
its residents can get properly inspired

577
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,660
the scene progression made me smile so

578
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,760
hard my face nearly broke off once and

579
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,460
removed this another fish so this is

580
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,900
where the kids imagination diverts from

581
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,490
the Rubies story and it's unclear how

582
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,320
those two timelines interact obviously

583
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,580
the kid doesn't know that Emmet

584
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,840
sacrificed himself for his friends

585
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,010
because he doesn't know he could move

586
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,210
around in the real world which means

587
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,350
that either explanation of how this

588
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,970
movie movies is flawed this is a

589
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,830
disaster it's hard to believe that Vince

590
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,810
Duffy dad actually bought Legos in order

591
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,150
to build his model Empire permanently oh

592
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,070
dude why don't you go ahead and use the

593
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,720
glue when you so obviously meant to use

594
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,250
it for your model dad ensures the

595
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,660
cancellation of one of his avatars

596
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,520
favorite shows dad business does the

597
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,780
squirt some of the medicine out before

598
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,920
giving the shot cliche with the

599
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,360
container of superglue okay the

600
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,800
micromanagers have been gluing things in

601
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,330
the Lego world while Dad business was

602
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,460
gluing them now however dad business is

603
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,810
walking away from the table to tend to

604
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,460
Emmet so why are the micromanagers

605
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,260
closing in on a robot pirate ascending

606
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,310
is neat and clever but it actually

607
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,720
raises way more questions than it

608
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,920
answers

609
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,570
the piece of resistance can still save

610
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,000
them now you saw that dozens of other

611
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,680
cry angles in the drawer dummy and it is

612
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,600
suddenly a masterbuilder because reasons

613
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,040
you see this is what I'm talking about

614
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,840
is the kid actually building this mech

615
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,370
suit for Emmet right now while his dad

616
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,960
is looking right at the city also the

617
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,250
micromanagers have been shown to be

618
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,440
dad's hands so the kid must literally be

619
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,060
slapping at his father's fingers Yuna

620
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,560
Kitty's negativity power is unleashed

621
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,330
man while I'd love to remove sins for

622
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,890
being awesome it took until this one

623
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,300
moment for her anger to finally come out

624
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,010
nothing before this did the trick only

625
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,020
seeing the thought to be dead Emmet in

626
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,400
the construction transformer being

627
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,750
attacked I guess if Emmet can hear

628
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,280
everyone right now they all somehow have

629
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,630
those magic Avengers earpieces

630
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,040
I guess you're expecting me to remove a

631
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,540
bunch of sins here at the end because we

632
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,920
learned most of this movie is happening

633
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,660
in this kid's imagination yeah while I'm

634
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,010
touched by the Will Ferrell ending and

635
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,660
it still moves all by himself in this

636
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,280
climactic scene suggesting he's actually

637
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,380
real so I'm gonna take off 20 sins for

638
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,970
this movie's raw heart and then cap it

639
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,100
they're assuming at least 75% of what I

640
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,120
saw in this movie was at least

641
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,160
potentially real Finn did you make all

642
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,260
of this suddenly this father thinks what

643
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,790
his son did is remarkable even though

644
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,170
just a couple minutes ago everything he

645
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,670
did was terrible I'd like to recap that

646
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,350
this is all because Emmet is a toy with

647
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,940
real human feelings who got Finn's

648
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,590
attention by falling off his dad's desk

649
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,910
who then gave him the piece of

650
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,390
resistance

651
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,070
Emmet suddenly turned into neo unikitty

652
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,930
suddenly turned into the Tasmanian devil

653
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,060
of killing things and now the dad not

654
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,500
knowing any of those things is like cool

655
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,090
shit son let's bond over this

656
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,480
what's the kragle here what's really

657
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,920
gonna bake dad's noodle is that there's

658
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,510
a king Lego figure that looks exactly

659
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,300
like him the prophecy is made up but

660
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,830
it's also true how fortuitous yeah but

661
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,150
even when they douse this universe in

662
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,680
mineral spirits there's no cooking wave

663
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,539
and get dudes pants off now

664
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,389
I have no idea to this day what those

665
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,629
two Italian ladies were singing about

666
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:12,979
truth is I don't want to know find a

667
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,869
black light place to look like a Jackson

668
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:17,239
Pollock painting this is even more

669
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,649
painful than it looks

670
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,129

671
