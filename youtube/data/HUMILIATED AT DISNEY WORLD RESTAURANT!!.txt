171
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,020
that's electronics are well I've never

172

been so humiliated this is a restaurant

173
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,240
where they yell at you and you can't

174
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,130
have your elbows on the table you like

175
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,240
in Chicago I see everything away from

176
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,279
the table no cheese in there I did it I

177
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,339
was scared but I was also happy you look

178
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:37,880
great

179
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,650

189
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,620

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,690
rotting tells me that there might not be

191
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,790
a gram on that

192
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,050
all I said was I just wanted to meet her

193
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,850
little bit and then you gave a really

194
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,460
vicious answer
