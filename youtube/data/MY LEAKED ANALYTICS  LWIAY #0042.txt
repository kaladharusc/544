It's all the same.

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,920
It's all the same anyway,

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,220
No one really cares.

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,340
Let's review the first PewDiePie meme everybody.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,200

18
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,500
If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs and plastic is made from oil...

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,700
plastic dinosaurs are made from real...

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,740
Dinosaurs...

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,860
Wait a minute. Oh my god

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,200
Ok, ok

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,920
This is epic

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,860
Son: &quot;Dad, why is my sister's name 'World Peace'?&quot;--

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,300
Oh, it's another one of those.

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,900
[Father:] &quot;Because it's your mother's biggest dream.&quot;

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,120
[Son:] &quot;Thanks, Dad.&quot;
[Father:] &quot;No problem, 7 upvotes.&quot;

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,400
You guys post the worst memes I have ever seen.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
How am I supposed to laugh at this?

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,940
Do you want anything positive for me to say about this?

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,040
It's garbage, It's pathetic.

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,680
Unless this has 7 upvotes,

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,280
then DON'T WASTE MY TIME!

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,820
Meme ? Correction ?

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,380
Do it right. Go to your room.

36
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,600
I /could/ save your life...

37
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,320
BUT AM I GONNA?

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
??

39
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Buy my life saving Package. You can get a docdom and a wristband.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,220
&quot;The patient is laughing with the doctor. He wants to die.&quot;

41
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,240
Who doesn't?

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Oh my god. Yes. I love this sketch.

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,760
[The one] where we see him slap everything.

44
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:54,460
*People, car roofs, exclaiming while Larry, the car salesman, slaps all of them*

45
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:07,440
This is the first time I've seen a decent version of this meme.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:15,540
That must have been so fun to film.

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,460
Wow, car salesmen sure slap a lot of roofs on vehicles.

48
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,740
&quot;This is the only car slap meme I actually thought was kind of funny, just because I like the original video.&quot;

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,120
Is this me???

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,020
You guys are learning! I am actually quite proud.

51
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,700
&quot;Every meme after 10 minute mark is a bon--&quot;

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,280
NO!

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,980
NOOoooooo!

54
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,080
All right, wait, we got a new LWIAY intro?

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,720
*beeps in the pitch and rythm of the intro*

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,780
Hey, heh

57
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,700
I don't know how that works, but that's pretty cool.

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,245
&quot;PewDiePie leaked analytics!&quot;-

59
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:55,760
Oh my god, I thought it was real!

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,980
&quot;Your estimated revenue: 0.--&quot; Oh, it is real!

61
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,400
It is real everybody.

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,100
Thank you, thank you.

63
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,240
It sure is wonderful to entertain millions of people.

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,090
That's right, I am entertaining with my own original content and I get so much back

65
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,800
You know, I don't need the money I get so much back from you guys. That's really all I need to thrive

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,489
That's really all I need to live. Please just more comments telling me what a piece of garbage I am

67
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:30,139
What the hell was that? This is so sad. Alexa play Despacito 2? (Alexa): Playing Despacito 2

68
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,050
Dame tu cosita uhh, uhh, dame tu cosita uh, ay

69
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,209
I like how some memes just keep lingering forever. They just never die

70
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,820
That's how you know it's a good meme. The oldest subscribers of Pewdiepie

71
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,730
Well, are they still subscribed though? SP RVD Ajax the beast?

72
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,930
Tex

73
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,430
cakti and

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,780
Arza. Dude. I remember having 19 subscribers and I was so happy. I was so happy. What a wholesome moment

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,959
I was wondering how many on PewDiePie subs are dead and it's gone and it's gone everybody

76
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,220
Thank you very much. This is why we can't have nice things. Hey, you marrying that meme review guy?

77
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,010
No English, I'm Italian. Sorry totally forgot

78
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,500
Lmao yeah

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,300
You're marrying that meme review guy? It actually works. Whenever I'm hungry

80
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,240
I just do this and she immediately starts cooking pasta. That's not even a joke. That's just truth. She makes great pasta

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know what to tell you man. What do you think of marrying -?

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,919
My simply I'm joke it's a joke. I love you so much. Ah

83
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,220
Getting paid an everyday struggle everybody.

84
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,960
Well now what YouTube does is that it's all green everything

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,140
I upload is green, but then you check the revenue and it's like congratulations! This video is monetized.

86
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,840
You made $2 on these millions of views.

87
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,390
Thank you. I'm glad it was monetized instead of when it's yellow. This makes all the difference for me

88
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,300
I can look in the camera like everyone else but am I gonna?

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,660
I said it was a self timer. And I said, this is a total Christian rock band shot

90
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:14,820
We should really embrace that spirit I go for it. Everyone else is like eh

91
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,420
I commit to the meme. What's feel is looking for original content. I will never

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,980
instigate violence against my faithful audience

93
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,760
Okay, but am I gonna?

94
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,140
Keep meme-ing me and see where things are GOING

95
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,360
*Felix smacks himself with his kawaii anime sword like a retard*

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,400
See? It's real. I'm level 5 Kendall story. I know how to mess you up. There's photo is from

97
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,440
1955 it did it was called a few seconds before happiness

98
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,010
9 year olds Brad one and two bonus me

99
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,680
Bonus meme is dead. Wake up

100
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,700
Grow up stupid 9 year olds clinging to the past. LWIAY is I'm coming. Oh my god

101
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,410
Stop that meme

102
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:09,680
Stop it. Stop that meme. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it anymore

103
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,180
Okay, it's bad enough being Swedish. Okay as it is

104
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,560
When Pewds makes two handshakes successfully at once

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
*bling* At one time

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,020
Good, good. We thought we'd start today with a little Behind the Scenes

107
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,400
Alright. Alright. So Felix, this is Nikki.

108
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Uh, she's a big fan. - Nice to meet you.

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,740
So nice *bling* meeting you

110
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,640
Awesome!

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,140
UGH! *2nd Pewds starts clapping*

112
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,580
*starts laughing*

113
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,880
Yeess!

114
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,680
(2nd Pewds) Bravo!

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,680
(both Pewds screaming Bravo and clapping)

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,780
See, you know

117
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,140
I know how to shake hand, it's when it gets into this area where I'm like well

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,909
I don't know what you want me to do here. Can we just shake hand please? Listen, I'm white, okay

119
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,080
I don't know how to do it.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
SKRATTAR DU! FÖRLORAR DU!

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,120
No, please no world cup memes it's too strong. It hurts too much

122
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,320
Hey, man, can you show me the answer for the fourth one? Yes, I can but am I gonna?

123
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes, this gets a solid ten out of ten. Let it began but I'm a-gonna mean browsing reddit by yourself

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,680
*Laughs in Swedish * No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,690
Watching a Swedish

126
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:30,340
Billionaire. Thank you very much browse reddit. That's how its done everybody. You know, why because you have no friends

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:36,540
Let's just keep let's just get that out of the way. Okay, it's alright, I don't have friends either

128
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:45,840
I should really call it. What up, my bros –my brothers. We're best friends right emotional manipulation

129
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,350
For more views

130
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:56,840
I work for–it worked for five years guys. People still wanted me to do it. It's your own fault. I don't know what to tell you, this

131
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,670
listen, I was

132
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,490
I was always honest

133
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,760
About it

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,830
But I am I gana

135
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,260
I hope you guys are enjoying this video so far

136
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,860
if you are make sure to leave a like and

137

Smash that subscribe button if you're new because we do this every single week guys

138
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,420
I know it's a lot of work for me to go through these reddits so I really do appreciate all the support that I can

139
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,800
Possibly get we're doing the last page

140
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,360
If you want to submit your meme

141
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,800
Check out a link in the description, earn the ultimate glory to put on your curriculum. My meme was on meme review

142
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,200
I mean LWIAY whatever it's the same thing basically.

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,220
Hard to swallow pills Pewdiepie doesn't kill memes

144
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,160
We just stop posting them because we know he won't review them anymore and we are desperate for his attention

145
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't know if I agree with that

146
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,820
I think it's more like once you explain the joke to so many people it kind of loses its value

147
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Unless there's more ways to play on it

148
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,360
I think if anything if a meme doesn't survive meme review it's a

149
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,660
Testimony that it probably wasn't that great of a meme to begin with. That's the truth bomb for you guys

150
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,160
I dropped three in a row now. You guys got a hit double subscribe for that if you want more

151
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,480
Okay, you think you're so clever? Huh? You think you're so smart? Okay

152
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,760
Do you

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
GRRR

154
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,860
ARRRRRRRGH (Felix losing it)

155
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,340
Damn it!

156
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,660
Fine you got me one time one time out of what? 20 episodes?

157
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,490
50 episodes one time you got me, whatever. I don't care. You're still 9, okay

158
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:43,640
You're still 9 can't believe Pewds killed Sweden by accident. Come on Sweden

159
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,640
That was good actually, you know

160
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,100
When I tweeted out: &quot;Can't wait to be surrounded by crying people here in England.&quot;

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,560
As soon as Sweden lost everyone was like

162
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,020
This didn't age well. This didn't age well

163
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,040
This did'd-d-d-d-d-d

164
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,829
That meme only works if you give it some time

165
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:01,600
Okay

166
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,020
You're supposed to take a meme from the past and then something happens

167
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,840
In the future and then you can go &quot;this didn't age well&quot; You can't go 20 *** minutes

168
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,120
and then go &quot;this didn't age well&quot;

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,810
It's not funny everyone tweeted it to me and I'm like, you're not funny

170
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,770
Okay, you stupid and then yes, it looks like it did age well!

171
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,220
Because England lost and I was hoping they would win because then I could rub it in more in the finals

172
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,510
I want people to suffer

173
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:35,829
What's up, man? You're okay. This is the top meme. What's up, man? You try to make an earth sandwich, bro

174
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:36,760
I don't know what you're trying to say

175
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,060
I'm in America or in India if we both simultaneously put a piece of bread on the ground. Boom! Earth s sandwich

176
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,660
I think I don't understand the game. Now I understand. I'm ready, bro. Me too. Great

177
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,160
That was it for this week's LWIAY I love this so much

178
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
*clap* *clap* (MEME REVIEW)

179
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,730
This makes me genuinely happy, thank you guys for all the memes

180
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:01,480
I really really do appreciate it and thank you for watching my videos every single day. I'll see you tomorrow

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,000
Good Bye! sleep tight my 9 year olds
