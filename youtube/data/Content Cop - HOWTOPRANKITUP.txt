00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,869
there's a wide variety of pranks that

19
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,970
Dennis has taught the kids over the

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,619
years and what we're gonna do in today's

21
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,600
video is deconstruct some of these

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,580
pranks figure out why the pranks are as

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,619
terrible as they are and maybe get a

24
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,990
sneak peek into the mindset of Dennis

25
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,759
one of the big downsides to some of

26
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,649
Dennis's pranks is that they're really

27
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,200
time consuming and require a lot of

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,149
effort so when you're finished your

29
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,970
window should look like this do this to

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,369
every window in the house don't think

31
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:53,990
that the entire house is filled with

32
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,000
balloons in this video he's not pulling

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,770
the prank on anyone he's just showing

34
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,450
you what the prank could look like if

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,860
you want to pull the prank yourself

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,360
you're gonna have to tape a bunch of

37
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,400
balloons to all the doors and windows of

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
the house that's a lot of work for the

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,190
outcome being whatever what we do I

40
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,870
don't know open the door what do you

41

that is so unlike a normal freeze pop I

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,209
don't eat those things and have a blue

64
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,550
tongue after whatever so when you had a

65
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,860
blue tongue I was like whoa

66
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,269
that's a good prank Dennis a prank might

67
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,709
sound really good in your head might be

68
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,420
really good on paper but then in

69
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,430
execution you might find out that it's a

70
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,610
bit shitty it's okay to exclude that

71
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,829
from your video I know you'd have to

72
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,220
turn 10 awesome freeze pop pranks into

73
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,360
nine awesome freeze pop pranks but it'll

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,250
be a better video here's a classic prank

75
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,959
get a paper cup and put a post-it note

76
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,390
giant spider under this cup somebody

77
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,130
please smash it I've never seen a spider

78
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,870
like this before and then you want to

79
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,530
tear it like the spider just tore his

80
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,840
way out of there it's a great way to

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,549
make someone think there's a scary

82
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,890
deadly spider loose in the house who are

83
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,590
you pranking an infant clearly it's not

84
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,239
intended for an infant because you have

85
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,590
writing on the outside of the cup

86
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,329
someone clearly has to be old enough to

87
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,660
read it to fall for the prank a spider

88
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,700
escaped a fucking cup tore its way

89
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,560
through it this is a very niche prank

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,810
this is for someone who is able to read

91
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,229
but it is also beyond Goble and also has

92
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,180
a chunk of their brain taken out this

93
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,800
prank I'm about to show you is inspired

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,450
by some of the previous pranks you just

95
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,789

96
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,860

98
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,849

99
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,860

101
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,650

102
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,969

103
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,530
to go back to the hardware store get

104
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,509

105
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,340

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:06,439
prank now it's time to wait for your

107
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:19,009
victim the channel was called how to

108
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,659
prank it up so there's no longer an

109
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,939
emphasis on putting the prank into

110
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,830
practice because anyone who's getting

111
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,860
duped by the prank is involved in it

112
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,650
it's Dennis pranking himself the only

113
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,000
other people who are getting pranked are

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,550
any of his bald buddies and even still

115
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,770
they're in on the fucking prank a good

116
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,810
example of one of these I'm going to be

117
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,629
the victim prank tutorials is the prank

118
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,879
vs. prank couple ex couple and Dennis

119
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,669
doing ice cream sandwich pranks and

120
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:51,650
replace it with barbecue sauce this

121
00:05:51,650 --> 00:06:00,469
stuff is horrible I do realize that I'm

122
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:02,240
overanalyzing the fuck out of this I

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,909
understand it's a lot easier to go to

124
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:07,279
your friend's apartment and deconstruct

125
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,960
an Ice Cream Sandwich and pour a bit of

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,330
barbecue sauce in the middle and have a

127
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,529
little mini challenge where you take a

128
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,009
single bite out of gross than it is to

129
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,889
go out in public and piss on someone but

130
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,900
I think I speak for a good amount of

131
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,479
people when I say it's vastly more

132
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,009
entertaining to watch you piss on

133
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,960
someone in public than it is to watch

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,900
you have a little gay fucking ice-cream

135
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,120
sandwich eating party dennis has really

136
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,460
hit the sweet spot on YouTube where it's

137
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,699
combining some visual ASMR of setting up

138
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,550
a prank and the slight satisfaction of

139
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,740
pranking yourself and I've decided to

140
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,169
dedicate my second channel to doing a

141
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:48,289
lot of these visual ASMR prank setup

142
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:49,620
videos

143
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,510
this next corndog prank all your enemy

144
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,699
is the corndog itself and a little bit

145
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:03,090
ingenuity so this one you're gonna do

146
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,830
just like all the other corndog pranks

147
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,870
pull it out just like that now this one

148
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,540
is a little bit tricky but you can do it

149
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,300
pretty easily just so long as you're

150
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,460
willing to be patient now all you need

151
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,889
to do to set up your prank is stick the

152
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,460

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,720
work well if you're putting a prank into

167
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,440
practice

168
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,720
it actually has to work this prank is

169
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,729
perfect to pull on a vegetarian or vegan

170
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,370
place that chicken sandwich right in

171
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,990
their hand so when they wake up the

172
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,250
first thing they see there's a

173
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,320
half-eaten chicken sandwich put the

174
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,849
hamburger right next to it so not only

175
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,099
do they cook it they a big sprinkle a

176
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,900
couple minutes around that's a good

177
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,970
vegetarian vegan prank I like that I

178
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,560
don't really have any vegetarian vegan

179
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,690
friends though this prank is perfect to

180
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,370
pull on someone who has celiac disease

181
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,020
or as gluten intolerant

182
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,210
grab that French bread and put it right

183
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,580
in their hand and then put that baguette

184
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,440
you got to sprinkle some of those around

185
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,330
maybe you tuck a few down and shorts

186
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,580
give another French bread I'll grab

187
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,979
another French bread and another one and

188
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,390
another one there's going to be so

189
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,250
ashamed when they wake up and realize

190
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,589
they ate all this bread but extremely

191
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,330
relieved when you tell him that it was

192
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,430
just for fun most of the pranks that

193
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,020
Dennis shows on his channel are pretty

194
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,730
harmless and wouldn't really get you in

195
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,589
any trouble but there is an occasional

196
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:57,930
prank they don't sort of shoehorn in a

197
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,140
random video that could easily get you

198
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,830
in a lot of hot water and use

199
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,680
police resources okay your dead body is

200
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,279
made up and then it's just been dripping

201
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,019
from the bag all you gotta do is take

202
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,700
this thing fill it in the pool

203
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,200
whether the police come or not I think

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
the dead body pranks are fuckin awesome

205
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,430
that's slightly edgy prank that could

206
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,230
get you in some trouble I think that's

207
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,570
pretty fuckin premium so I've decided to

208
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,700
give you guys my own how to prank it up

209
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,339
tutorial with a slightly edgy feel to it

210
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,560
this next prank is called the hot dog

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,790

212
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,920

way you turn the heat on full blast now

217
