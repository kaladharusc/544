60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,360
week to dry and I've also been told that

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,430
I was using synthetic brushes and like

62
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,980
dry natural bristle brushes are the best

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,650
so like I had the ability to make clouds

64
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,540
but that brush was not giving me the

65
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,250
ability to make them like light and

66
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,890
fluffy it's not my fault I tried my best

67
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,080

integration of your face somehow didn't

193
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,449
take away from the scariness of the

194
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,610
