1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,740
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,540
YouTube boogie2988 comin atcha libels

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,950
again through the power of the internet

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,660
this is my weekly gaming news series

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,620
what you just talked about whatever

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,480
video game related stuff is interesting

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,670
to me this week so let's just get right

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,250
into the games so Red Dead Redemption 2

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,260
is out and it is one of the highest

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,119
rating games of this generation at

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,260
probably one of the highest-rated games

12
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,650
of all time with a Metacritic score of

13
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,140
97 for the PlayStation 4 version a 97

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,119
for the Xbox one version over the years

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,279
the score of the PlayStation 4 of 7.6

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,520
only a 6.9 on the Xbox version but that

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,050
is that is pretty good I mean the

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,270
critics obviously love this game users

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,670
not so much regardless whether or not

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,230
users are rating at high on Metacritic

21
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,420
they certainly did purchase it because

22
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,950
this game generated seven hundred and

23
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,690
twenty five million dollars in worldwide

24
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,149
sales in the first three days that makes

25
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,309
it the biggest opening weekend in the

26
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,500
history of entertainment of course that

27
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,600
beats out Avengers infinity war which

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,309
was the highest opening weekend in film

29
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,250
history obviously a video game is more

30
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,840
expensive than a movie ticket but still

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,430
know what I think critics loved about

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,840
this game is the game is very very

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,540
polished there's a tremendous amount of

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,700
detail in either how animals react or

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,100
how NPCs react or or just the gameplay

36
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,170
itself is very very good the story is

37
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,000
very interesting this game is very much

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,560
a rockstar game if you love that

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,150
open-world experience with a ton of

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,220
detail you will love this game if you

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,479
don't like that formula you're

42
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,500
definitely not gonna like it here

43
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,850
because it doesn't deviate from that

44
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,500
formula very much in fact it just kind

45
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,420
of perfects that formula but here's the

46
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,500
thing if you don't like single-player

47
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,479
games you're not going to like this if

48
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,850
you don't like a long grindy or story

49
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,229
driven game you're not gonna like this

50
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,390
if you don't like hunting simulators or

51
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,670
all kinds of the storyline character

52
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,290
driven stuff you're not gonna like this

53
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,400
and there are plenty of gamers out there

54
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,350
who prefer your Call of Duty is in your

55
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,360
fortnight's in your battlefields and

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,619
your League of Legends and your

57
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,509
competitive games that's perfectly okay

58
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,130
I understand where they would not like

59
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,509
this game but for someone like me who

60
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,880
loves a story-driven open-world

61
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,790
character driven game whoo boy I'm gonna

62
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,170
put a hundred dollars into this game and

63
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,219
that's before I even touch the

64
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,899
multiplayer now I do have complaints

65
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,759
about this game specifically for someone

66
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,680
like me who is short on time to put into

67
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,689
a game I have to say it is very very

68
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,970
grinding building money is grindy doing

69
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,879
quests is grindy doing stuff is grindy

70
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,770
it very much feels like a single-player

71
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,570
in the MOE RPG where you have this

72
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,670
massive open world where you can go tame

73
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,130
horses or do quests or do crafts and and

74
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,990
use that to generate money and use that

75
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,940
money to advance your gang and things

76
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,620
along that lines it is a very very

77
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,810
grindy game if you're into that though

78
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,580
you definitely wanna get your bang for

79
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,090
your buck

80
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,100
you're gonna definitely get $60 worth of

81
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,900
entertainment out of this $60 game I

82
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,280
highly recommend it

83
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,630
I do want to say thank you by the way to

84
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,040
the folks over at Rockstar and let you

85
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,690
guys know that they did send me a little

86
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,040
care package with some t-shirts and

87
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,650
stuff and a review code for the game but

88
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,210
then again a review code of the game and

89
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,590
a couple of t-shirts is definitely not

90
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,050
going to be enough to skew my opinion on

91
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,940
a game even if you think it is I mean

92
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,740
for God's sakes they sent me a review

93
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,930
code for battlefield 2 and that did not

94
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,850
go over well oh and one more thing about

95
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,680
Rockstar Games what we're talking about

96
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,510
Red Dead Redemption - you remember last

97
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,100
week's video I talked about people being

98
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,920
forced to work mandatory overtime and I

99
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,410
said that it wasn't forced overtime well

100
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,820
it looks like a lot more developers have

101
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,620
talked about that who worked on Red Dead

102
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,120
who have worked at Rockstar Games and

103
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,850
said that they thought that the overtime

104
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,440
that Rockstar was requesting was

105
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,170
mandatory and that Rockstar phrased it

106
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,720
in a way that made it feel mandatory now

107
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,490
Rockstar says they have gone forward now

108
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,690
and they've made sure that everybody the

109
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,100
noses have worked for them even if they

110
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,650
request overtime hours even if they ask

111
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,030
you to do crunch time it is not

112
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,440
mandatory you don't have to work through

113
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,730
the weekend you don't have to work

114
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,290
through four or five weekends in a row

115
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,450
you don't have to stay extra three or

116
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,190
four hours even though many people who

117
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,990
work there felt that was mandatory and

118
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,790
it looks like a lot of people who work

119
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,420
at Rockstar

120
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,430
feel like that is a breath of fresh air

121
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,200
or they are looking forward to working

122
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,990
overtime only when they want to and I

123
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,490
think that's a great thing so thanks for

124
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,780
sharing that story thanks for watching

125
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,850
that story thanks for watching my video

126
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,650
about it and help me get that message

127
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,760
out in the world because we made a lot

128
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,470
of people's lives a lot better over

129
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,420
Rockstar Games people are so obsessed

130
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,730
with this overtime story that a lot of

131
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,440
people feel like this advertisement

132
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,960
inside the game is like a note for help

133
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,730
from the developers if you look at this

134
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,680
ad it says this weapon is made in a

135
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,709
factory own and control in Worchester

136
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,090
Massachusetts it is made by skilled

137
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,250
laborers who work tireless hours each

138
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,200
week and on the weekends for little pay

139
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,270
in order to bring you the finest

140
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,040
revolver in the field today

141
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,229
now this might just be coincidence but

142
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,250
here's a bigger coincidence word

143
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,290
Chester Massachusetts does exist it's

144
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,120
right outside of Boston and it's just

145
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,100
down the road from Andover Massachusetts

146
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,340
where rockstar England is located in

147
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,530
several hundred employees who worked

148
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,740
there in that town did overtime hours

149
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,020
working on Red Dead Redemption so it

150
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,810
very very much maybe a little Easter Egg

151
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,280
snuck into the game about this

152
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,870
controversy and I think that's pretty

153
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,490
cool now this video was sponsored by the

154
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,470
folks over glasses USA the folks who

155
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,210
made these glasses you've seen in every

156
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,220
video for the last year the Francis

157
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,290
frames that I wear the sunglasses I wear

158
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,940
that I'm out in public I get all of my

159
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,560
glasses from the link in the description

160
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,480
box below the reason I shop a glasses

161
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,150
USA is very simple convenience and price

162
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,010
you know as well as I do whatever you go

163
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,020
get an eye exam done they want you to

164
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,370
wait for the glasses for a couple of

165
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,290
weeks and then on top of that they try

166
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,970

mean these are the best glasses I have

189
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,840
ever owned every pair of glasses I've

190
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,030
gotten from there have been amazing and

191

192
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,800

description box below they will give you

195
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,190
a deep deep discount on even the most

196
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,229
expensive pairs of frames so I really

197
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,490

198
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,900
getting a nice pair of glasses that I

199
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,000
recommend and you'll be supporting me at

200
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,430
the same time so fall out 76 had its

201
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,919
beta this week and it turned out about

202
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,960
as well as I think most of us expected

203
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,060
to begin with there was one major bug

204
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,950
that if you pre downloaded the beta on

205
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,010
the launch day of the beta it forced a

206
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,350
delete of the pre download and then

207
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,210
forced you to read download it all over

208
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,720
again all 47 gigs of the games so that

209
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,460
that was a problem most people who

210
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,490
signed up for the beta

211
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,650
to play in the first beta Pete Hines at

212
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,300
Bethesda did apologize for that and said

213
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,220
they would extend the hours for the

214
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
Thursday beta so that people would have

215
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,639
a chance to place if they didn't get to

216
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,740
play on the Tuesday beta but the people

217
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,169
who did get to play on the Tuesday beta

218
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,910
discovered pretty much exactly what I

219
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,830
was expecting from this game the

220
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,180
leveling system is interesting the

221
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,370
combat system is interesting when you do

222
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,199
find other players it is interesting and

223
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,990
the game is best played in a large group

224
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,000
of friends but the world does kind of

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,520
feel boring and empty this is not a

226
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,319
traditional Fallout game and for it to

227
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,060
be fun you definitely need to be playing

228
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,069
with other people that's kind of

229
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,780
frustrating for those of you who wanted

230
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,880
a more traditional Fallout experience

231
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,860
playing this game solo just doesn't seem

232
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,300
to be that fun now it wouldn't be a

233
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,310
bethesda game if there weren't some bugs

234
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,380
in the game but since this is not the

235
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,849
usual single-player game we see from

236
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,520
Bethesda bugs are a big big issue in a

237
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,280
multiplayer game and so people during

238
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,770
the beta discovered an insane bug

239
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,770
according to polygon and kotaku the

240
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,539
physics for the game are tied directly

241
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,719
to your framerate now on the PlayStation

242
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,370
of the Xbox there's no way to get around

243
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,949
the framerate stuff but on PC there is

244
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,229
so you could be zooming very quickly

245
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,639
across the map you could be firing

246
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,469
faster you could be doing a lot of stuff

247
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,289
faster just by messing with the

248
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,210
framerate and the any settings on your

249
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,120
game probably will get you banned but

250
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,500
that is definitely something that's

251
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,840
possible the game is flawed from the

252
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,639
very basic level for the PC version

253
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,009
which kind of sucks cuz that's what I

254
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:11,960
was planning to play in the beta as well

255
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,729
as some other people has confirmed there

256
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,289
will be microtransactions of the game

257
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,150
these micro transaction points are going

258
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,590
to be known as atoms and there's going

259
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,659
to be an atomic shop but they have made

260
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,520
the promise it will never affect the

261
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,319
gameplay no matter how much you spend

262
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,090
you'll never be better than any other

263
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,569
player it's purely cosmetic stuff so at

264
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,460
least we have that going into the actual

265
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,110
launch of the game fingers crossed so

266
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,089
they stick to that known I'm trying to

267
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,860
join the hate train on this game I do

268
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,110
still plan to play it provided they give

269
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,120
me a review code anyway and I will

270
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,620
definitely stream this game and play it

271
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,089
with you guys I just want to make sure

272
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,130
you guys know going into this game it is

273
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,720
a bethesda game so it's probably going

274
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,220
to be buggy it is definitely not a

275
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,959
traditional fallout game it is a

276
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,490
multiplayer game and it should be

277
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,890
kind of goofy and silly and good for a

278
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,350
laugh and I'm hoping the reviews will be

279
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,610
good I haven't got the play on the beta

280
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,170
yet but I'm hopefully I will get to play

281
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,459
in a beta before the game goes live and

282
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,959
hopefully I'll be able to stream it but

283
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,160
I do encourage you if you're still

284
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
interested in this game if you have a $5

285
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,399
pre-order and a Game Stop for this game

286
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,589
or something like that be sure before

287
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,630
you pick up a retail copy of this game

288
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,750
look at the news look at gameplay make

289
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,670
sure you know what you're getting into

290
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,720
because it's definitely not a

291
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,640
traditional Fallout game number to play

292
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,760
in anyway sure but it definitely looks

293
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,500
like it might might be a pretty buggy

294
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,120
mess alright that's gonna do it for this

295
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,740
