1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,330
let's get this over with

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,700
43 seconds of logos tom tasks when

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,750
you're the eighth movie of a franchise

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,280
and your production company is called

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,080
original film what point do you consider

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,150
a name change also you have a goosebumps

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,650
equal and a Sonic the Hedgehog movie

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,240
coming out soon so it's time to invest

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,130
in a you and an end for your name in

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,660
case you confused it with Havana India

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,039
you see it's different this time because

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,420
they're using classic cars this time

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,899
make God deal Dom's in a new country in

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,280
this chapter so therefore the movie has

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,079
to manufacture some bull conflict so we

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,370
can get a classic fast and furious

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,829
racing before it becomes xxx ocean's 17

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,390
identity he knows it doesn't matter

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,329
what's under a hood the only thing that

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,700
matters is who's behind the wheel okay

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,989
then I'd like to see you race this guy

22
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,289
driving a 1985 Toyota Camry racing a

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,420
mile it's like a baker's dozen only with

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,059
empanadas instead of donuts dumb Donald

25
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,410
race to race this asshole and this

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,030
dilapidated old truck because the movie

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,500
is unsure if the audience realizes how

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,030
good a driver Dom really is so the

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,350
stakes against him have to keep going up

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,000
even past the point of insanity

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,210
laughing us nah this is Cuban Nos is

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,799
there a difference between Cuban nos and

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,630
regular nas I thought nah stood for a

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,970
nitrous oxide like as in if it were any

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,439
different it would no longer be nos but

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,390
some other compound entirely conspicuous

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,340
cocaine confounds consumers calculating

38
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,540
cola comparisons a Cuban mild on I

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,860
wonder what the casting call is like for

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,450
the flag girls in this franchise like

41
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,770
they must tell them you won't be in any

42
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,329
other movies after this but on the plus

43
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,829
side you'll get to show your ass to

44
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,270
everybody this is broad daylight

45
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,890
I realize Cuba's a foreign communist

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,240
country but I still don't think they

47
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,590
allow Havana streets to be shut down for

48
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,150
drag races without some cops showing up

49
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,100
motorcycle traffic Stoppers look out by

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,659
getting a wide space to stop traffic in

51
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:46,829
time and not get run over

52
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,119
how have they not already gone a mile

53
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,189
yeah yeah I know it's a Cuban mile but

54
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,659
they're not already gone the amount of

55
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,920
distance I think of Cuban mile is okay

56
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,810
this works this works it's not enough

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,580
for Tom to win this race with a bad car

58
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,500
it also has to catch fire before the

59
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,940
finish line this is all these movies

60
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,680
summed up in one scene honestly also

61
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,170
sure this car can drive and drive fast

62
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,280
while on fire

63
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:17,580
it's just Cuban fire cue movie yeah but

64
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,500
they have this slow tech not want you to

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,470
figure out if Tom actually won you know

66
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,700
it would have been more awesome to

67
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,410
actually see the car at full speed crash

68
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,330
into the water without five cuts what is

69
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,410
this mother Gandhi now you won my car my

70
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,160
respect

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,990
I'll bet ten thousand dollars right now

72
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,610
Tom ask this guy for a favor before the

73
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,290
end of the movie Jaws was too slow for

74
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,470
Toretto anyway so let that be a lesson

75
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,390
to you kids you can somehow make a deal

76
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,950
with a gangster not fulfill your end of

77
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,300
the bargain have a cousin who just

78
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,740
happens to be in your hometown who's a

79
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,960
legendary street racer try to race your

80
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,880
peace car against the gangsters car and

81
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,530
a terrible disadvantage had your cousin

82
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,030
destroy that car during the race then

83
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,710
have the same cousin give you his

84
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,630
awesome car and have absolutely no

85
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,620
consequences at all

86
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
they keep trying to invent new ways to

87
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,830
keep all these movies titles confusing

88
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,390
and overlapping fate rhymes with 8

89
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,910
hilarious ah Letty and Dom's love the

90
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,350
heart and soul of this entire four hey

91
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,370
wait a second

92
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,590
how's that honeymoon going down Seifer

93
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,730
decides the best way to get Dom's

94
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,230
attention is to fake a breakdown

95
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,430
rather than go to some of the many

96
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,870
places she's about to rattle off that

97
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,700
she knows Dom goes to everyday is this

98
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,260
the road you take to your apartment

99
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,739
every morning what else is different Dom

100
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,370
Santiago's closed

101
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,260
how does Dom who has no job and is

102
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,610
simply hanging out in Cuba have a

103
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,110
predictable routine every morning

104
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,530
oh and Dom so I heard cypher open the

105
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,000
door to her car I'm pretty sure she

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,560
never closed that hood also she shows

107
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,880
him something on the phone that we don't

108
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,140
see that causes him to betray his

109
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,610
friends and family I think it's pretty

110
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,110
clear she showed him the sins video for

111
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,820
Furious 7 movies continue to think we

112
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,900
need to know the longitude and latitude

113
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,880
of a new place during a scene change the

114
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,830
rock coaches girls soccer was probably a

115
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,810
movie idea at one time during that Tooth

116
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,580
Fairy phase thank God we finally got to

117
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,900
see a nod to that cinematic greatness

118
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,730
here movie that is over two hours has

119
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,530
time for this hey Hobbes this important

120
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,820
world crisis needed to be brought to

121
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,650
your attention at the soccer game not

122
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,470
before not after but now dammit I

123
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,530
look at I mean he's just how the

124
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,300
openings in case you confused it with

125
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,370
Berlin of take my breath away Fang also

126
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,900
here's the job Dom and his crew are on

127
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,490
mid operation we don't need to know how

128
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,080
they stole the EMP or what the plan was

129
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,370
because this movie is way more

130
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,720
interested in dropping surprise plot

131
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,280
twists and girls soccer on you than

132
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,660
giving you details of a heist or

133
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,180
character motivations also also why did

134
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,350
the movie give us that scene showing

135
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,420
Charlize talking to DOM now we know to

136
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,100
expect something weird from him imagine

137
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,720
if we experienced this job the way his

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
teammates do and learn of his deception

139
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,170
on the spot that would have been way

140
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,050
better bombs away

141
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,070
seriously how did the team get in here

142
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,480
and set up all these bombs and gadgets

143
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,370
without anyone seeing it and this mugger

144
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,110
is attached to a wrecking ball I don't

145
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,250
care how he did it someone would have

146
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,440
noticed also why not set up bombs on the

147
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,820
roadway instead of hoping the wrecking

148
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,980
ball plan works oh it's so we can see

149
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,210
all those cars get hit by a wrecking

150
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,670
ball isn't it alright earn that paycheck

151
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,530
Tyreese by the way considering they

152
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,550
didn't tell him about the wrecking ball

153
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,900
plan couldn't have like died Hobbs

154
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,580
survives all kinds of this oh great

155
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,170
another airstrip I wonder if this one's

156
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,460
also twenty-two miles long

157
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,230
barely a car trip Lane can just land on

158
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,730
a dime going whatever speed it was going

159
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,800
allow a car to drive onto it and fly

160
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,030
straight up into the air with its rear

161
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,919
cargo entrance still open and no one in

162
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,270
the control tower was able to ID that

163
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,190
planes transponder signal or decipher

164
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,390
where it went after this using radar

165
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,010
honestly this movie suggests a

166
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,419
successful takeoff is all this plane

167
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,220
needs to get away with it but that's not

168
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,870
how airspace works Germany would be

169
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,250
scrambling some fighters right about now

170
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,350
why did lady go to Berlin bring keepsake

171
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,940
pictures of her and DOM and put them in

172
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,290
the glove box of the borrowed or stolen

173
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,270
vehicle she drove during the robbery Dom

174
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,010
is clearly communicating with somebody

175
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,290
that's above hey hey remember when they

176
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,340
introduced Ramsay Bolton

177
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,870
I mean missandei to the Fast and Furious

178
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,090
crew and she was some badass hacker or

179
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,950
some yeah they still haven't given or

180
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,600
anything to do ecords in the same prison

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,930
what are the odds that Hercules I love

182
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,950
our characters in both Central

183
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,240
Intelligence and fate of the Furious

184
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,280
refer to the rock as Hercules as if this

185
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,900
meta joke is something side-splitting

186
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,340
Lee hilarious this prisoner rivalry is

187
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,950
still going on cuz we run from we don't

188
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,870
settle fights by throwing bomb that's

189
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,580
funny because we're on from

190
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,530
[Music]

191
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,230
what what

192
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,210
also if teasing one sells camera

193
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,980
electrical thing he opens all the cells

194
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,419
then the designer of this prison is

195
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,430
facing a serious lawsuit after this is

196
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,120
editing and this camera works the rock

197
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,919
sponges are made of dynamite or a

198
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,169
sharknado or some omnipotence this

199
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,490
pronounced makes me wonder why you can't

200
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,900
steal the MacGuffin thing back via your

201
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,490
own general godlike abilities rather

202
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,430
than recruiting a bunch of car thieves a

203
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,630
location so undisclosed the movie

204
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,680
doesn't even know six eight nine ten so

205
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,780
literally half the Interpol top ten is

206
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,250
made up of members of this group is that

207
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,910
even possible

208
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,100
listen TP Cooper still out there her

209
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,930
digital identity is scrub every few

210
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,950
seconds worldwide what also despite this

211
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,570
we knew who we were looking for when we

212
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,010
took this picture of her I'm bringing in

213
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,840
an extra pair of hands you know your

214
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,669
mortal enemy that's a big surprise which

215
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,900
definitely builds trust between all of

216
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,169
us

217
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,580
I had him waiting outside until I gave

218
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,930
him an electric shock to cue him into

219
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,400
the room also this franchise is

220
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,389
officially Pirates of the Caribbean

221
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,039
where everybody changes they're good guy

222
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,539
and bad guy status TIFF it's some sort

223
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,280
of crazy-ass narrative and somehow this

224
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840
secret government doesn't have anyone as

225
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,190
good as this guy with computers now

226
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,050
aside from myself there's only two men

227
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,430
in the world that I've ever managed to

228
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,840
actually track him down with any success

229
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,180
plus one woman so that's four people at

230
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,710
least so he apparently isn't that hard

231
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,660
to find but sure we still need shown for

232
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,849
some reason so like it or not you two

233
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,620
are gonna work together it's just like

234
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,389
in all those other movies that pairing

235
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,860
up to cops criminals that hated each

236
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,590
other he still dreams yeah like fresh

237
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,830
babies alright they're not in China

238
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,240
thanks for holding our hand during this

239
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,520
stage Europe's ku2 girl they sometimes

240
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,620
give lines too this is interesting why

241
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,830
because that's here you means Dom and

242
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,060
cypher were attacking this place at the

243
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,320
same time they were being tracked

244
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,660
what great dramatic timing Dom shoots a

245
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,919
whole bunch of glance for some reason as

246
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,690
if he lives his life 3/4 through the

247
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,919
script of die hard at a time we're

248
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,090
supposed to be reminded that DOM is now

249
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,440
evil but everything about this movie

250
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,820
tells me he's just faking and will turn

251
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,650
good at the last second so like this is

252
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,930
lost on me we can't bring Brian and me

253
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,639
into this can't you just make a phone

254
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,030
call

255
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,620
do they even have to be dragged into the

256
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,479
situation to help problem with putting

257
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,250
your foot on the tightest neck as you

258
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,539
could never let it out the problem with

259
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,039
lines like this is the movie thinks

260
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,150
they're cool sounding which they're not

261
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,280
but also that they make no goddamn sense

262
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,509
oh but Selena from

263
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,159
which one was it I think it's the third

264
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,289
one no it's a fourth one for sure wait

265
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,809
it might even be the fifth one a baby so

266
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:27,979
I guess that YouTube video she showed

267
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,599
him earlier in Cuba was of this gal in

268
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,909
captivity even so how was that enough to

269
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:33,919
get Dom to go 100% rogue to the point

270
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,240
where he wouldn't even tip off Letty or

271
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,709
the other somehow unexpected Elena

272
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,560
everyone else was pregnant

273
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,329
you had just fun though lady was alive

274
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,440
this is where the Fast and Furious

275
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,089
franchise officially became the days of

276
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:44,600
our lives

277
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
it's amazing how sidekicks be getting

278
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,360
pregnant just before the last time you

279
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,160
saw them Vin Diesel's Oscar clip say

280
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,540
forgives down a gun and goes through all

281
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,589
the reasons why he won't kill her

282
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:52,820
ultimately saying there's a bunch of

283
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,990
dudes ready to kill the son you didn't

284
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,430
know you had up until two minutes ago I

285
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,360
don't know why she even bothered with

286
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,740
this exercise since I thought it was

287
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,120
already common knowledge but bloated

288
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,949
movies got a bloat yo satellites and

289
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:03,709
radar grids all across the globe shit

290
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,170
like an ocean if you say so so you know

291
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,089
where DOM is headed yeah

292
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,130
New York wait I see online chatting with

293
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,389
somebody who knew where tom was headed

294
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,389
did he post a query on Usenet or some it

295
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,620
would be a lot more awesome to know how

296
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,940
he did this even if you had to go

297
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,410
through some sort of ant-man explanation

298
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,029
speeding like this on this famous bridge

299
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,170
brings out zero cops

300
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,269
we're Tom just happens to be driving

301
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,949
over a bridge that Roman and Tesh are

302
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:26,360
currently driving under that may be the

303
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,800
least believable moment in this movie

304
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,870
including the submarine crap welcome to

305
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,430
our new base of operations

306
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,430
aka God's car warehouse yes The Fast &amp;

307
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,449
Furious series has always been about

308
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,100
cars but this is pushing it to some

309
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,149
total bullshit

310
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,339
this is like all the cars it's neon

311
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,069
orange so choose anything less

312
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,959
conspicuous dude this entire warehouse

313
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,480
of cars has nothing conspicuous I like

314
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,240
your beard your planta black Santa

315
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,430
I gotta need him

316
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,710
daaamn can see this ATM from here which

317
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,290
is fine my gas but where is it you and I

318
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,000
both know there's no et I'm outside that

319
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,350
red building there we find out later

320
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,910
that Dom got helped to block the ATM

321
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,380
camera so that he could set up some plan

322
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,850
with Sean's mom but how did he

323
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,200
communicate his plan with everybody when

324
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,520
he's being monitored are you saying that

325
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,110
cypher trust Domino to allow him to

326
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,250
communicate to people unmonitored

327
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,930
whatever the case may be he orchestrated

328
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,399
impossible connections in an impossible

329
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
amount of time to give you something

330
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,850
back there is no way Dom does this in

331
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,279
five minutes I mean coming up gone and

332
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,750
I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down

333
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,770
your throat you're gonna stick a

334
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,360
toothbrush right up your ass to brush

335
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
him movie believes that we anticipate a

336
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,510
rock Statham fights so much that we'll

337
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,190
be delighted with several scenes devoted

338
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,050
to dick swinging the gods I really is

339
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,550
the only true conclusion to Hollywood

340
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,230
zoom an enhance obsession it was always

341
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,880
gonna end this way it's zombie time oh

342
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,410
it was a zombie time by the fourth or

343
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,880
fifth movie but at least you're finally

344
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,320
acknowledging it why do you even need

345
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
Dom let alone badly need him for this

346
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,380
job let's watch it I guess this is kind

347
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,029
of cool and all but this is a super

348
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,560
complicated way to get what you want if

349
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,029
you've got God's eye you can find anyone

350
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,350
anywhere in the world with our

351
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,970
connections and know how did it really

352
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,560
require a bunch of hacked cars crashing

353
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,610
into him to get what she wants

354
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,230
take out the lead and follow cars

355
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,880
luckily there's a car dealership full of

356
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,100
cars we can hack the

357
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,610
[Music]

358
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,480
remember this is all just to steal a

359
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,649
case from one man

360
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,240
overkill watched this movie and walked

361
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,220
down after finding it excessive now

362
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,199
that's dumb it's actually not though

363
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,879
Dom hasn't done dick yet it's actually

364
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,709
1,000 autonomous car controlled by

365
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,629
Charlize and one hacker guy and Dom is

366
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,680
just kind of following along and

367
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,449
watching but whatever even after that

368
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,529
repeated lecture about choosing

369
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,660
inconspicuous cars all these mothers

370
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,249
drive out into battle in the most

371
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:46,279
conspicuous cars ever and all that car

372
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,439
control utter bull technobabble is just

373
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,149
to set up this raining car shot and

374
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,949
sometimes guys the visual is not worth

375
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,329
the flimsy explanation you weave for it

376
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,069
all so seriously there are this many

377
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,420
cars that you can hack remotely

378
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,920
I don't doubt there would be a lot this

379
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,089
movie makes it sound like every single

380
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,649
car everyone drives is hooked up to a

381
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,959
network target immobilized

382
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,930
oh she needed 1,000 cars to immobilize

383
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,180
the Russian guy but DOM is

384
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,990
super-important as the guy that then

385
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,059
goes in to grab the case any hired goon

386
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,620
could take over here lady the more this

387
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,120
series focuses on spectacle the more

388
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,499
they raise the middle finger to people

389
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,059
who want even a sliver of logic or

390
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,129
consistency in the case this is how the

391
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,779
usual suspects foiled New York's finest

392
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,430
taxi service only way louder and

393
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,910
stupider

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,050
[Music]

395
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,029
and I won't be needing this anymore I

396
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,209
think in the warmer tunes I wear right

397
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,110
in front of me

398
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,089
I mean God these movies everything has

399
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,649
to be some sort of reveal looking for

400
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:37,910
someone there in the building right now

401
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,679
found your team make your boss gasp

402
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,999
before revealing they're here right now

403
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:43,549
he's got a saying he start a new kissing

404
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,649
or what first of all the police even

405
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,850
broadcast that panic-inducing

406
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,649
information on channels they know some

407
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,970
citizens and journalists are listening

408
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,160
to also how would anyone know that this

409
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,660
soon after it happened in order to even

410
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,309
broadcasted on police scanners in the

411
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,839
first place I don't know it's funnier

412
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,129
but there's nobody who needs to go down

413
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,689
this street or that this guy just

414
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:01,009
totally ran a red light and didn't give

415
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,290
a fuck or these people casually sitting

416
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,790
down next to the cars watching the movie

417
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,779
if only there were cops in this city

418
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,160
this is so clearly impossible that the

419
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,720
filmmakers cut several times during this

420
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,519
book to cover up all the times this car

421
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,019
crash doing the stunts let me put

422
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,339
together the scene and it's clearly

423
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,199
never driven in Manhattan before miles

424
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,179
of open road enough to stare down at

425
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,699
your ex enough to engage the nos somehow

426
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,439
of all the stupid they tossed out in

427
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,269
brainstorming for this movie car harpoon

428
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,459
still made the final cut or carpoon if

429
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:29,509
you will I love how these movies show

430
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,100
cars that are clearly already going as

431
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
fast as they can complete with a nonce

432
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,339
injection and yet there's always another

433
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:35,990
gear that these assholes can try like

434
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,579
there's a theoretical notch on the stick

435
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:38,929
that summons Dumbledore to make your

436
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:41,600
ride sicker about 2,000 horsepower in

437
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,509
that thing

438
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:46,519
try whatever it is it's bull five

439
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,439
government made cars can't stop this

440
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,660
thing also does nobody have a gun that

441
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,110
can shoot out the tires go well Dom to

442
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,730
speak reacting to fake killing Deckard

443
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,649
let it be ninjas up on him and steals

444
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,170
the case somehow you can in town feel

445
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,490
bad for Charlize Theron's in this movie

446
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,019
because for half of it she's by herself

447
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,730
looking at a screen delivering pointless

448
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,619
lines I don't know why you're doing this

449
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,209
but I know one thing

450
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,529
you better have a previously heretofore

451
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,509
unknown young son being held hostage or

452
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,459
so help me God I will just take it from

453
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,429
a dead girl love is what finally makes

454
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,259
Dom abandon his evil character and Brik

455
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,329
good love for Letty over love for his

456
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:21,889
son or something I don't really think

457
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,029
character motivation is something these

458
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,919
movies give much thought to Deckard he

459
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,549
didn't make it

460
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,499
movie flat-out lies to you to set up a

461
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,480
stupid reveal later but also why are

462
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,160
they sad about deckert's death he was

463
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,959
the villain in the last movie they don't

464
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,180
exactly love that guy right

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,590
[Music]

466
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,850
so I turned off all the lights and

467
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,200
waited until you got here to set up the

468
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,980
surprise I'm gonna kill your baby party

[Music]

470
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,560
this kid would not be calling Dom Dada

471
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,180
on his second encounter with him this is

472
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,290
one of the cheapest ploys to pull

473
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,480
audience heartstrings ever no now

474
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,500
they're gonna have to find a babysitter

475

Connor wait

476
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,470
he's also linked to somebody I'd quite

477
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,210
like to forget this movie just became

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,920
Spectre all of a sudden hey you remember

479
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
all those characters from previous

480
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,980
chapters they're all tied to one main

481
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,360
baddie somehow even though that's

482
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,400
clearly impossible taking your son got

483
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,160
me the cards no cards well get me the

484
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,810
nukes yeah but shouldn't you have done

485
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,100
something with those codes as soon as

486
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,690
you got them you know besides setting up

487
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,310
that elaborate threat to kill Dom's baby

488
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,200
mama and kid doesn't Russian know that

489
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,160
somebody has their codes and are

490
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,510
changing them at this very second or

491
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,340
nuclear codes that insecure that if they

492
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,020
got stolen someone really has this kind

493
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,400
of power the problem we've had with

494
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,810
tracking cipher is there's nothing to

495
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,310
trace except for the satellite blind

496
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,960
spots that jason statham figured out to

497
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,310
track Dom's secret flight to New York

498
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,510
City but he didn't bother teaching

499
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,010
anyone that so I guess that knowledge

500
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,900
died with him we got to call this in all

501
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,860
the way up the chain but unfortunately

502
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,530
the Russian Minister of Defense got

503
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,910
himself involved a little incident on

504
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,100
u.s. territory and two governments

505
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,330
aren't talking to each other for a while

506
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,940
but who so you shouldn't even try is it

507
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,740
really that simple of a reason come on

508
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,360
we're talking about goddamn stolen

509
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
nuclear codes here not shooting down a

510
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,720
spy plane pray that the apocalypse

511
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,340
doesn't come knocking on your mama's

512
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,850
front door

513
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,010
the rock has reverted back to full WWE

514
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,750
mode these days and it's movies are

515
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,190
suffering for it take whatever vehicle

516
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,990
you want all bets are off

517
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,880
yeah but you're going to ice Russia and

518
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,350
yet some of these fools will still

519
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,460
choose Lambos and stupid act like that

520
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,760
[Music]

521
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,140
do they parachute these cars on top of

522
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,490
this mountain are you telling me Russian

523
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,050
airspace is this awful they didn't spot

524
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,520
a large cargo plane flying through here

525
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,290
or that the separatists who control this

526
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,029
base somehow missed them yep about to

527
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,890
drive dangerously on ice and snow in a

528
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,970
goddamn Lambo

529
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,210
commonsense be damned again and left for

530
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,010
dead on the side of the road I mean

531
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,960
really only three of the five heroes

532
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,610
make sensible snow vehicle choices I

533
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,600
tried to take a piss I recognize that's

534
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,589
a dick joke right there

535
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,510
if dcmp is as powerful as this movie

536
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,430
says it is then why doesn't it also stop

537
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,170
Dom's car dead in its tracks you know

538
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,180
since it's on top of it I think cycle

539
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,770
just rebooted that sub to slave its

540
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,360
commands sister crate are you telling me

541
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
this nuclear submarine can be remotely

542
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,360
hacked just because cipher used the EMP

543
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,390
a nuclear submarine seriously if you can

544
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,490
get me into that wheel house I can tap

545
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:07,290
the network and counter hack cipher look

546
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,760
I know this car was made by God or

547
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,380
whatever but now it's able to crash into

548
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,699
a building and an armored truck like

549
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,319
they're not even there don't look the

550
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,939
bad guys are at a facility that has all

551
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,620
these exposed gas tanks around so things

552
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,900
can explode easily isn't that nice knock

553
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,990
knock open up the door it's real who is

554
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,720
where you don't care guys oh just tired

555
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,610
actively hope Dom dies or at the very

556
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,230
least fails every time he does a stunt

557
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,240
like this on top of this he even kills a

558
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,890
ton of bad guys in the process it can't

559
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,630
be this good or lucky it takes all the

560
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,830
tension out of the scenes when the guy

561
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,650
doesn't ever lose how do you like this

562
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,450
well it's taken roughly a movie and a

563
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,890
half for Ramsey to actually do anything

564
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,900
and we know she's a crazy good hacker I

565
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,670
find it extraordinarily laughable that

566
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,170
she could counter hack cipher this

567
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,340
quickly since she's supposed to be

568
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,770
equally good not better hi Vamsi and

569
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,750
then she counter counter hacks and I

570
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,980
wonder how these two amazing hackers

571
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,600
don't have any protections in play when

572
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,300
they're off doing their hacking yeah my

573
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,070
computer can totally show you detailed

574
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,150
heat maps of people running around

575
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,350
inside a nuclear sub

576
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,010
[Music]

577
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,940
gods I my ass

578
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,990
she's just God by the way all this

579
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,790
punching and kicking and yelling is just

580
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,929
doing anything for you these are the

581
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:20,980
scenes with the characters who have

582
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,330
nothing to do or insert it into the

583
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,860
action to fight basically faceless

584
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,650
drones inducing yawning he's knocked me

585
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,059
out weird that she didn't do that before

586
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,850
what in the hell are you guys doing

587
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,040
it'll be labeled guidance go why didn't

588
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,480
you say that in the first place yep

589
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,669
you've got the upper hand on one person

590
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,950
when your entire base just got done time

591
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,360
for a good cackle which will ultimately

592
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,890
lead to your demise this is like the guy

593
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,299
who sacks the backup quarterback in the

594
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,620
fourth quarter in a game his team is

595
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,570
losing 67 to 3 and we have a countdown

596
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,400
I'd like to remind at this point that

597
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,750
cypher got access to this missile

598
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,400
because she stole nuclear codes from a

599
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,080
Russian Minister of Defense the space

600
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
was taken over by Russian separatists

601
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,230
and yet the Russian government was still

602
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,490
in control of those missiles apparently

603
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,929
they didn't bother to change or remove

604
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,460
those codes from the nuclear football

605
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,380
when those guys took over I find that

606
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,150
unlikely but ain't I guess stupid things

607
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,500
happen in the real world all the time

608
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,690
we got the chip no nukes for her what

609
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,120
are you a nuke Nazi God we got company

610
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,100
a lot of company a lot of military

611
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,080
company are they supporting Charlize or

612
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,880
just defending a Russian base who knows

613
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,320
who cares and who let the dogs out you

614
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,030
have no sympathy from me Tyreese you

615
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,770
chose the Lambo knowing you were headed

616
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,179
to ice Russia personally I feel like

617
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:29,650
this is payback for years of coasting on

618
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,270
your part despite the fact that Roman is

619
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,590
comically spinning on the ice the

620
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,120
Russian terrorist guys can't hit it or

621
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,500
really anybody they're kind of a

622
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,850
terrible group of thugs actually I don't

623
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,020
even know how they took this base over

624
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,910
in the first place well we contemplate

625
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,290
whether DOM wants to put this car in

626
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,299
gear who's taking care of his kit it's

627
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,010
there really a bad guy who's feeding his

628
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,630
son and changing diapers I would love to

629
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,910
see that movie oh wait maybe not forget

630
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,360
what I said

631
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,070
tange starts blasting away and instantly

632
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,390
hits one of the trucks something that

633
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,740
none of the assholes behind him could do

634
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,330
for a full minute of blasting I don't

635
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,890
look this one is going to take out more

636
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,320
trucks reminds me of that old adage life

637
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,880
is always fair and full of constitute

638
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,840
good luck

639
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,430
okay so how's he holding on to the

640
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,140
outside of the door remember the doors

641
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,060
closed until the tank rips it off so

642
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,430
once that tears off he better be holding

643
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,630
on to the inside of it or else he's done

644
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,940
for maybe once it rips off he grabs the

645
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,530
outside but that would be an incredible

646
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,970
feat considering the speed at which all

647
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,340
this takes place come on guys kill him

648
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,560
sweep the leg if DOM is constantly being

649
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,120
monitored on this operation then how is

650
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,110
he getting away with these obvious

651
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,120
shenanigans

652
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,100
okay so Dom shot Deckard earlier and to

653
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,600
no one's surprise except cypher he's

654
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,550
still alive my question is how did they

655
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,290
plan this remember all this

656
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,370
how did Dom know it would come to this

657
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,230
as luck would have it this entire scene

658
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,520
leads to the moment where Deckard is

659
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,140
able to chase him to a secluded area to

660
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,180
fake his death also with God's eye how

661
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,470
did cypher not track every movement

662
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,060
Deckard made until she could confirm his

663
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:57,860
death see I told you but hilariously the

664
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,150
movie made him so paper-thin in the

665
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,500
opening scene it doesn't trust you to

666
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,060
remember his face and has to literally

667
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,640
show you who he is also you movie you

668
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,140
mean DOM ask this guy from the beginning

669
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,430
to fly from Cuba all the way to New York

670
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,020
City to do five minutes worth of work

671
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,910
doesn't Dom have like closer connections

672
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,290
who could easily do this job

673
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,450
congratulations Dom you just killed your

674
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,640
son no stupid his cipher right now she

675
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,960
saw the transporter and bard the Bowman

676
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,790
three minutes ago does she really think

677
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,290
Dom would be so arrogant if he didn't

678
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,140
have his son secured you're wrong I just

679
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,150
saved by the way to play the devil's

680
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,740
advocate here and I will since charlize

681
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,270
theron is in this movie DOM is still

682
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,590
owing to arrogant here dealing with

683
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,150
cypher for all he knows she's crazy

684
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,560
enough to crash the plane with her the

685
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,150
Shah brothers and his son on it what

686
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,180
would you know we start crying

687
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,560
fast and furious crew must have started

688
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,270
praying because dawn in his supercar a

689
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,460
literal day who sex machina comes to the

690
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,880
rescue

691
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,710
also they made a car that is too awesome

692
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,750
in this movie no flaws whatsoever

693
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,370
you're literally Superman in this car

694
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,780
not setting the baby down before

695
00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:03,520
fighting god damn this scene seemed just

696
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,530
broke the encounter meanwhile a movie

697
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,330
still has the audacity to steal the kid

698
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,560
has headphones on during the gunfight

699
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,890
scene from face off how did the

700
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,720
submarine catch up to the cars if you're

701
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,250
telling me the cars are only going 40

702
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,900
miles an hour okay maybe I'll believe

703
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,460
you look they're going pretty much full

704
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,110
speed as best they can hour tops correct

705
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:33,240
we got this are you okay are you okay

706
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:55,180
breathing Dom foolishly believes this

707
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,010
indestructible car can be destroyed by a

708
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,810
heat-seeking missile it could just put

709
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,250
this in park and watch the thing

710
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,390
harmlessly glance off the sideview

711
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,700
mirror well they finally did it the Fast

712
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,380
and Furious franchise just jumped us up

713
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,600
no no you this movie

714
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,500
that is not how fire works a handful of

715
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,940
cars around a guy generally will not

716
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,830
save said guy from damage during a

717
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,410
raging explosion fire just FYI how did

718
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:32,590
you find me if Dom gave cypher a

719
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,240
necklace by which Deckard could track

720
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,620
her oh I didn't he pass this information

721
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,510
on to his team as well they lucked out

722
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,040
finding her in Russia by guessing her

723
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,540
most logical target but that would have

724
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,160
been really handy information to have no

725
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,700
matter what

726
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,290
why did Deckard's death need to be a

727
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,060
surprise to the team there's only one

728
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,010
flaw in your plan what's that that's

729
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,780
extremely presumptuous on your part but

730
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,070
anything that gets us closer to the

731
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,450
ending of the movie is fine by me

732
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,370
is this all kind of nuclear ISM

733
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,340
happening this ice relax without the

734
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,810
trigger tips those nukes are harmless

735
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,030
not to mention the entire sub exploded a

736
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,920
minute ago you think the nukes survived

737
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,600
that is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds

738
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,720
or the Dark Knight obviously this isn't

739
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,010
even a real choice when it comes to

740
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,960
movies but this movie really saying that

741
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,790
Ramsey wants either of these guys at

742
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,710
ease her only choices in life is she

743
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,030
even considering going out with one of

744
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,770
them I would have loved it if she

745
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,540
suddenly had a girlfriend or a great

746
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,990
worm you've heard me say you never turn

747
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,360
your back on family nope never heard you

748
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,310
say that once in one movie it's a new

749
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:38,800
concept you just invented right now

750
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,760
well I finally figured kill my car I

751
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,090
came in

752
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,940
[Music]

753
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,980
I believe that's the cyber-terrorist

754
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,240
known as cypher I know

755
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:13,540

757

761
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:36,000
Fighting's better things best

762
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,370
Eva's phone Cindy honey I want to buy
