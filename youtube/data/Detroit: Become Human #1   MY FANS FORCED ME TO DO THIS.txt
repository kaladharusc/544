1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,040
????

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,820
FINALLY

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,960
[I'm] playing a videogame everybody, hooray!

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,320
???

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,440
Detroit: Become Human, the dumbest title ever. I can never remember it.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,260
like Beyond Two Souls.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,380
What the hell is that?

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,860
&quot;Detroit:  Become Human&quot;

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,060
Come up with a normal title, please.

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,040
I spent the last five minutes just being like:

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,940
'What, what was the name of the game again?'

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,180
Android whamen: Hello, 
Felix: Oh God.

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,580
AW: Welcome to the Detroit experience.
Felix: *sound of disgust*

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,380
AW: I'm an Android and I'll be your hostess.

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,840
Felix: Oh, this is uncomfortable.

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,900
Hostess: Before we begin, let's make some adjustments to optimize your experience.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,120
Felix: oof.

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,880
Hostess: These language settings were detected on your console,

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,080
Hostess: Are they correct?

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,280
Felix: Oh my god, She's breaking the fourth WAAALLLL!!

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,720
*Pewds laughs at his own joke*

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,380
Felix: Oh, that's awesome.

23
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,840
Felix: I'll do medium [text size]. I'm a medium kind of guy.

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,180
Felix: Man, It's weird.

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,940
Felix: It's weird when you see uhh...

26
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,580
Felix : You know [what], I won't go there.

27
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,700
*mad cackle*

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,020
Hostess: Please adjust your screen settings.

29
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,200
Felix: Okay they're fine.

30
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,120
Felix: They're fine. Trust me, they're fine.

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
Felix: Okay? Just--
Hostess: Thank you

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,380
Felix: You're welcome .
Hostess: Now select your profile.

33
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,420
Felix: What do you want- What profile??

34
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,340
Felix: Ex-- I want immersive game play... with advanced controls.

35
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,660
Felix: Uh, well, if you pick casual you shouldn't even be playing.

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,580
Felix: Here we go.

37
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,660
Hostess: When this sign is displayed, please do not turn off your console.

38
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,260
Felix (showing respecc): Well, you can't tell me what to do.

39
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,280
Hostess: You are now ready to begin DETROIT.

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,520
Felix: Thank you
Hostess: Remember:

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,600
Hostess: This is not just a story...

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,140
Hostess: /This/ is our future.

43
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,100
*Pewds giggles quietly*

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,940
Felix: Sure. SURE BUDDY.

45
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,480
Felix: Anyway, I'm really excited to play this game.

46
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,020
I love Heavy Rain, it's one of my favorite games.

47
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,520
Beyond Two Souls, you know,

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
it was entertaining but, no, it wasn't good.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
So that's why I was kind of hesitant when this came out.

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,000
I didn't really want to check it out right away, until [the] reviews came in,

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,980
and then I just got off the hype train,

52
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,160
And everyone had already played it,

53
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,660
so I thought maybe I shouldn't play it,

54
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,200
but then I realized that it's actually really cool.

55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,280
I, I want to play it. I genuinely want to play it.

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,740
So here we are. I hope you guys join me on this.... uhhh, journey,

57
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,580
It's always fun to do Let's Plays...

58
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,200
if it's a good game, and I'm told this is good.

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,900
Guy (relaying into walkie-talkie): Repeat, Negotiator on site.

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,920
And I'm walking everybody

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Lady, in hysterics: No, stop... I... I... I can't leave her.

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,880
*giggles* 
You hear stuff in the background.

63
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,820
HEY, lemme take this.
*Lady crying in the background*

64
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,840
For those of you who are not familiar with these type of games: They're always very story-oriented.

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,320
Uhh.. leaving you with random options in front of you 
*Lady keeps crying in the background*

66
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,900
Heavy Rain was so revolutionary in the genre--
Lady: PLEASE,

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,020
Felix: I don't care about your girl!
Lady: Please, you gotta save my little girl--!

68
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,660
Let me go off on a monologue.

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,460
Lady: Wait...you're sending an android?

70
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,620
Police: Alright Ma'am. You need to go.
Lady: You can't... You do that! You woul--

71
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,980
Lady: Why aren't you sending a real person!?

72
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,640
Felix: Hey, I am a real person, thank you.
Lady: Don't let that thing near her!

73
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,160
Felix: Alright, Captain Allen.

74
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:11,220
Felix: &quot;Consult your objectives&quot;. All right, what do we got- find Cap- It looks like he's--

75
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,920
Felix: What's going on here?

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,320
Felix: Hey bro, Android here. uwu uwu uwu

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,020
been ewwor in system

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:29,560
Felix: Hello?

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,240
*laughs at Negotiator being ignored(?)*

80
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,060
*chuckle*

81
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,260
Felix: Umm

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:53,660
Felix: I don't know [what to pick]. What's the name, I guess?

83
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,860
Felix: Uuuumm

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,820
How is he acting?

85
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,300
I don't know what's happening, so it's kinda hard to determine [what to choose].

86
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,320
So it was a hostage [situation].

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,780
Felix: Ohhhh, I see what's happening [here].

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,680
&quot;Probability of Success&quot; &quot;Every Second Counts&quot;. WHAT?

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,820
&quot;Understand What Happened&quot;? Okay.

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:27,960
&quot;Save Hostage at All Costs&quot;. I'll save the hostage.

91
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,440
&quot;Understand what happened&quot;?

92
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,020
Sorry. My objective is what?

93
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,540
Oh, it's all of these things? I thought I could pick.

94
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,020
This is really interesting

95
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,040
All right, analyze.

96
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,700
He's trying to.

97
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,660
Alright, what happened to you?

98
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,600
The first officer that responded.

99
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,840
Okay, we gotta find clues. Okay, that's cool.

100
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,360
Alright, what have we got?

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,680
Collecting data

102
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,520
P.O Deckart, Antony

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,360
Yeah, no one will care about anyone named Antony

104
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,100
*scoffs* What a loser

105
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,360
&quot;Lead styphnate&quot;

106
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,140
I'm joking. Stop crying.

107
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
&quot;Only one shot&quot; okay.

108
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,180
Alright *mumbling* need one more for the...

109
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,960
*gasp* Look! I found it guys. I must be some sort of detective.

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,120
All right, &quot;right heart ventricle...&quot;. Okay, alright.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
Lets DECONSTRUCT THIS, EVERYONE.

112
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,000
&quot;Use L2 to rec--&quot;

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Okay, so we can see what happened. Ah, thats cool.

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,760
?Shot through the heart 
And you're to blame, darling, you give love-?

115
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,940
?a bad name?

116
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,320
&quot;Cop shot the deviant&quot; &quot;Rewind to search for a new clue&quot;

117
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,140
Aaaaaand...

118
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,240
There was a hostage...

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,900
giving some moral support, got it. Okay.

120
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,060
And then, there must be another clue here somewhere.

121
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,640
Let's see, now

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,940
There it is.

123
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,380
I am G-. Honestly, I'm a genius. You're watching a genius let's play here everyone. You're welcome.

124
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,920
We found it. We found the gun. It's under the table

125
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,300
*broken laugh*

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,000
No one, thanks to hyper

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
*purr*

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,160
Technology

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,900
we managed to found the unfound weapon.

130
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,680
It's been here for years

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,000
No one could ever possibly have found it without me

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Well, I guess I can't leave fingerprints if I'm gonna Android so I'll just go ahead and you want to stir that

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,240
one

134
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,960
Century, more Androids, less work

135
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,900
Connor, is that his name? He gives no fuAAH

136
00:06:46,900 --> 00:07:00,190
That's close guys, don't worry YouTube bots aren't on us yet

137
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:07,660
Yes, I love this so far

138
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:18,640
Okay, so our probability of success increases the more information

139
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,220
Dude! You just..

140
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,180
Alright we found the hostage

141
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:34,960
Why does he kind of strangely look like me?

142
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:44,650
What's your name? I mean, my name is Con...

143
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,850
So I skipped two things nah fam

144
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:58,470
I'm playing this game wrong. I'll go back. I don't I'm yeah, okay, since I'm replaying this I might as well

145
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,870
let's say what I wanted to say, which is..

146
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,090
I love-

147
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,920
these type of games

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,940
Especially heavy rain. The reason why I heavy rain is one of my favourite games is because you truly felt like

149
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,369
You impacted the story with your decisions there's so many different endings in that game

150
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:23,920
and if you messed up the goal was to save your son right and if you messed up you could actually

151
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,380
It's such a dark ending and if you make it the game continues, I don't know

152
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,600
I thought it was brilliant and then beyond two souls games out

153
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,050
And the whole game basically just plays itself I think is an insult to video games

154
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,440
Almost in retrospect

155
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,830
but what I'm seeing so far is that this is actually they they've gone back to the rules

156
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,709
I love these type of games where you really feel. Okay, we're back. Okay, we're back

157
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,500
I was gonna say I love these type of games where

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,960
it really feels like

159
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:08,880
Your decision makes an impact but also it's hard to play for YouTube- Oh my god

160
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,100
Because people get so mad if they know you make the wrong mistake or the wrong move

161
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,720
I will tell you I will try my best to make the right decisions

162
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,900
But I hit that there's not family was about to have dinner

163
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:37,940
So we have two more things to do search the hostage room and examine the victims now we did that.

164
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,050
Probably if we go out like I did and we fail

165
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:49,440
The story will be different or they're just giving us BS and the story will go on no matter what the same way

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,240
That's the problem with these games. They a lot of it is just making

167
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
You think that you have a choice

168
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,800
I think that's why the telltale games got so stale is you play it the first time in your life and you're like,

169
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Whoa!

170
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,320
I really feel like I'm making an impact on the story and I'm making my own decisions&quot; and then you realize no

171
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,140
It's the same for everyone

172
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:22,850
Not a PlayStation VR Wow missed opportunity wait it's headphones. Oh the child didn't hear gunshots

173
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:29,240
Wait is it a meme? if you if you love the life you live you will live a life of

174
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,200
what that's the dumbest thing I ever heard

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040

176

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,660
Conveniently have that video played

179
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:03,380
I don't buy this this is too eyy our probability of success has increased. Alright

180
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,940
Examine the victims. Who's the victims? Ah, here's the victim

181

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,020
All right, so we still only have

What else could there be...

217
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,240

The Deviant took the father's gun, okay

220
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,980
So we know he's armed basically.

221
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980

222
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Wuat the Friak?

223
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,680

224
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,360
*Gasp*

225
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400

Okay.. I think we officially did everything

229
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,709
We have no choice at this point, okay?

230
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,829
Come on 78% Those are good odds.

231

Why would you shoot me? I dubbed nothing

232
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,269
Dan: Don't come any closer or I'll jump

233
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:55,320
He would never hurt her

234
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,080
Con: Hi Daniel

235
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:03,980

246
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,360
Con: You think she betrayed you but she's done nothing wrong

247
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
Dan: She lied to me!

248
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,000
Did you lie Emma?

249
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,940
Angst Dan: She's just like all the others humans

250
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,700
Aw come on Daniel, you're being a total part of your brain. What's possible cause

251
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,750
All right. Let's do that.

252
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,350
Con: That's what happened

253
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,640
He thought it was part of his family

254
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,940
There's something in the pool.

255
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,900
Dan:  But I was just there toy.. something you throw away when you're done

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,700
Con: Listen, I know it's not your fault

258
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,380
Con: These emotions you're feeling are just errors in your software

259
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,120

283
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:56,860

Maybe even six if I use the gun that was another option, I guess to shoot him. That is so cool that they show you

291
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,460
See this is what I mean now, I actually feel like

Aah

293
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,340
I wasted too much time apparently. Oh my god. This is so cool

294
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,230
Can I go back though, that's the real question. I don't think I can.

295
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,720
Ok, leave the gun.

296
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,700

Okay, I gotta pee. all right, we're back everybody yay, we're gonna play more

317
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:51,769

318
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,990
 

319
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,060
That took me a lot longer than probably what the video is

320
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:07,450
All right, who is this annoying little prick I can already tell

321
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,440
Ten thousand different dishes, what is this machine?

322
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,510
I'm sorry. Tell me more about this. Oh the part that an Android. Oh

323
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:25,750
Am I one of the showcases oh I am arn&quot;t I

324
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,250
That's awesome

325
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:37,990
Are we gonna come up next to me? Just this one gives amazing handjob

326
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,990
At night

327
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,620
Contacts emergency services it was breaking or if it detects smoke. I mean, that's pretty awesome

328
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,750
Does that one know all the fortnight dances

329
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,990
Oh really can you do the L Danes?

330
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,809
Absolutely me anytime anywhere else Oh God. Don't buy me difficult getting it back in working order

331
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,039
It was really I'm repaired

332
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,570
A car hit it

333
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,760
stupid accident

334
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,049
I see

335
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,720
Anyway, it's as good as new now, except that we had to reset it. Meaning we had to wipe its memory

336
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Hope you don't mind. I'll be fine. Damn. I don't know what's gonna add you give it a name my daughter did

337
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,890
We bought home register your name movie' my home

338
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,100
Dammit I'm a lady My name is Kara

339
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,690
Kara

340
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,330
So innocent so sweet. Oh

341
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,110
my god

342
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,869
This is a cover of

343
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:55,119
It's a movie soundtrack, so I don't know if David cage still work on this it's not his name David cage

344
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,389
He's like the first

345
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:05,350
Game developer that really tried to make games into movies you play one of his first games actually, it's the second one

346
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,739
What is it called comments? Help me out. I forgot

347
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,190
(Fahrenheit)

348
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:17,289
And I remember you play it and it just says play movie and rewind and all that stuff. That was a fun game actually

349
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,889
You guys remember that did you watch me play that game? That was a long time ago. That was really fun

350
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:33,820
Hey, it's come a long way since then it's pretty impressive to see that development how these games improved throughout

351
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,230
It seems also like they learned from

352
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,980
The last one which wasn't bad it just bad ideas

353
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,370
They desperately wanted to be a movie so bad

354
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,100
I think there was the first game that they beyond two souls was the first one the last one

355
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:58,860
That they showed it like a movie festival can movie festival or something like that?

356
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,659
If you guys had an Android what would you do it with it?

357
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:10,789
It's kind of weird cuz like if you play with VR and you see

358
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,769
Other enemies or people

359
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:18,159
It's so fun to just mess around with and I feel like if there was an Android you do the same thing

360
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:26,090
Okay, it's David Cage still working on it. Of course he is

361
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:33,500
Another thing about this game is that they always just look incredible and then we got a really ugly shot about tree great

362
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,950
Just the faces the way they did faces. I

363
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,169
remember playing heavy rain

364
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,379
before I did youtube I

365
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:47,450
Spent my last bit of money on that game. I bought a PlayStation 3 and

366
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,409
Heavy rain and it was such I had such a blast

367
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:57,830
It was at a time where I didn't really know what I was doing with my life. I

368
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:04,040
Was such a good escapism

369
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,760
All right, we're playing as this guy now, I don't know why

370
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,990
Sorry, I love talking about myself. What do you want I

371
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:18,230
have no objectives retrieve order 66 I

372
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,010
Have to go to Bellini PaintShop

373
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay

374
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,540
So he is just sending out its Androids to do his errands this is so cool

375
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,300
Plastic idiots

376
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:45,380
We solve racism by adding androids now you can hate them instead, press r2 to use GPS. All right

377
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:52,820
Bellini Paints, not this way. All right this way everybody

378
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:04,000
Hot dogs, all right, you're doing a terrible job for an Android

379
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,360
Open your eyes

380
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,290
Boy

381
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:20,650
Can't swear just empty since let's check it out here

382
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:30,520
Demon oh really?

383
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,750
Where is the dab option come on

384
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,600
Right, I forgot we're in Detroit

385
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:45,460
He's the guy on the cover, isn't he?

386
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:58,419
Guess there is a thing with the slaves and the black men, maybe they'll play into that I don't know

387
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:03,429
Okay, so where is the stupid paint shop there it is right there Bellini Paints

388
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:12,399
color since 2009 a very good

389
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:19,929
Herrow, give me your finest paint, please

390
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:27,490
Identification verified. Oh, he's an Android too. This should be awkward

391
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:32,470
Here is your order number eight four seven

392
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,470
Please confirm payment.

393
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,620
 

394

Hey, it's the cover everyone of the game payment confirmed

395
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:46,149
Transaction complete

396
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:52,590
Obviously you guys probably heard that you can put like a chip in in your hand and then in some places very few

397
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,919
I think you can pay using the chip

398
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:08,080
Controls are still awkward as ever would you guys ever do with that consider doing something like that?

399
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:19,090
You know things that seems crazy now might be perfectly fine in the future

400
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:29,710
It's fun paying for stuff so awkward already like put in the card putting the pen awkwardly awkwardly waiting

401
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,510
Any time

402
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,860
I'am waiting to pay something and you wait for the machine, right?

403
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,450
I'm always considering like doing small talk or do I just blankly stare at this machinery?

404
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,730
It's my dilemma every single time. What do you guys do? Please? Let me know. I genuinely wanna know

405
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,350
Cuz it's so awkward right? It's like just too much time not to talk

406
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:56,770
No, the opposite of what I said and just enough time that you could talk

407
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,440
No one cares I get it

408
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,700
Why do you hate me?

409
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,630
I mean, they're literally everywhere. I don't know why hey

410
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,370
Hey, hey, oh my god. Don't swear, please

411
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:18,820
They terk our debs

412
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:27,309
Come on does he not know kung fu come on Neo download some moves.

413
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:36,740
You job stealer

414
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,120
All right

415
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,419
It's enough it alone. Let us teach this bastard a lesson

416
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:50,540
Hey, hey, yeah, I'm gonna have to fine you

417
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:58,640
Damage it huh. They're gonna take your job next.They took our job

418
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,890
Let's go

419
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,650
It sounds like you don't even need a job if you got another guy just doing everything for you get androids, right?

420
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:15,710
And then just make them do your job and you get a commission for it. Great

421
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,630
Alright oh

422
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,520
I gotta get the bus

423
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,490
you know people always get mad at

424
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:30,440
Destructive technology at least people jobless and it's understandable

425
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:48,120
But those those technologies bring in more jobs anyway it's always a cycle that we know has gone through

426
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:55,399
It's like wheat farming back in the day when they got machinery for farming

427
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:00,149
Oh they get to their it come on that has to be some sort of Rosa Park thing

428
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:16,830
They get to ride at their special place in the bus

429
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,580
Well, that was pretty pointless

430
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,880
Okay, wait, so

431
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,250
Yeah, it couldn't have gone different ways, but we could have explored more I guess so

432
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,980
Let's Marcus took the bus everybody

433
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:39,340
Interesting. Oh, this reminds me heavy rain so much

434
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,330
I you know what?

435
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,930
Maybe you guys are judging this guy. I'm sure he's a wonderful guy. I'm sure he's gonna take great care of us

436
00:32:46,930 --> 00:33:10,620
I feel really excited about this. How can he afford her though?

437
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Im baack

438
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,440
 

439
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,850
use r1 to switch camera angle

440
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,760
So awkward if you have to move your

441
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,690
Movement stick everyone. Hello. I'm a gamer epic gamer here. two weeks. So the place is a mess

442
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:35,520
Not my fault washing you cook the meals and you take care of

443
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,610
Swearing! Stop it.

444
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,280
That's Alice look after her homework bath all that crap

445
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:55,140
Got it. Yes Todd
Get started down here. Then you do upstairs. I

446
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,460
Really hope there's not gonna be any sexual favors, please

447
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,030
Hold r2 to scan the environment. Okay. So alright we're gonna clean that. Oh thank god game now. This is a game

448
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:12,240
Alright a whamen simulation

449
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,250
I'm joking

450
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,290
Okay, collect the trash

451
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:24,480
Kitchen, alright, what do we get? I could just gotta take you don't start by taking the trash out you damn big old dingus

452
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,320
What do I do now? How do I put it down?

453
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,220
Yeah, okay okay

454
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:42,649
Yeah, yeah I can get that all right, all right clean the counter

455
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,490

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:52,010
You nasty boy you nasty you dirty

457
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,380
Disgust, oh she just throw away the plates didn't she, look at that

458
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:03,200
Why wash the plates when you can dab on the plates clean the coffee table

459
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:12,220
Excuse me herrow. T.V. on

460
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,930
This guy eats a lot of pizza

461
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:20,780
How does she fit all those pizza cartons in that trash bag? Huh? What is this magical?

462
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:28,910
Cardboard Plus you can't mix. Oh, okay. She has two bags. Thank God about the future

463
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:36,390
A credit card application form. All right, and the bank is not doing

464
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,060
You know, it was me if I had papers like that I probably would have oh this is awkward

465
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:47,280
The thing with control your walking this direction and then all of a sudden you're walking the opposite and then you start walking

468
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,610
I know that movie um

482
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,880
What is wrong with you? I think some weird drugs

483
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:28,750
I've made a good start down here. I'll head upstairs do what you have to do, but stop bothering me

484
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:38,860

485
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:44,290

486
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,440
Can I not clean those up that looks like

487
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,380
So, can you stop making that sound?

488
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,510
All right. Let's make the bed

489
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,300
ventilate the room

490
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,880
So this is why you tune in for this let's play to watch someone clean in a video game

491
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,390
It doesn't get better than this. Oh

492
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,230
Man, she's really good at making bed. See this is my dream. I hate making the bed

493
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:14,410
It's like one of those things. I hate the most if my sheet isn't perfectly straight. I can't sleep

494
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:20,260
So I have to adjust it all the time. I hate it. Okay, why can't we invent better sheets, please?

495
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,010
someone get on that or Androids I

496
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,990
mean not by an Android

497
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,810
Yes, I was feel so weird about

498
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:37,840
Like I don't like having a cleaning lady or something like that or cleaning man. If that's the case I

499
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,800
Just don't like having other people do stuff for me

500
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,580
But I was like Machinery doing stuff for me

501
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:53,760
Like I don't know why like just dishwasher in general makes me happy. I'm like, this is so great. I

502
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:03,620
Don't care about this, how do I get out?

503
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:10,220
Like have you ever tried 3d printer it always so fun lookin at it works

504

Why would I Switch it on

505
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:29,780
They really like yellow on this channel

506
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:48,950
So there is a thing about rights between Androids and Humans

507
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,623
That's interesting

508
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:58,190
Another 225 jobs?

509
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:12,080
Alright, We get it it's a lot of controversy we gotta ventilate as well that is definitely what I wanted to click

510
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:19,500
Man I feel like cleaning in real life now

511
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,120

512
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,780

515
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,920
Okay, Todd's room check

516

Optional heck yeah, we're gonna do the optional tasks?

522
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,880

523
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,100
There's options for me to clean?

524
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,680

525

526
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:32,180

529
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,930

-Im sure we used to be friends before I was reset. Maybe we can be friends again

531
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,109
Um what do you like?                     
-You should tell me about yourself

532
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:15,440
What you like to do where you like to go your favorite foods, that would really help me

533
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,359
Tehe, awkward

534
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,579
Ugh Mother? -What about your mother?

535
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,520
Will she be home soon?

536
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,540
My name is Kara.

537
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:36,360
-Your father said you chose my name Kara, it's nice. How did you choose it?

538
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,600
We're good move here

539
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:50,740
What she gave me? is it a note? it's a key

540
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:56,980
Where does it go?

541
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,960
Kara's like, I love keys

542
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,520
I just love keys

543
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:21,250
Ask Todd. Oh, okay. So that's like all our memories

544
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:29,590
Jacksepticeye, I knew he was behind this after all that son of a gun

545
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:44,900
That's the mom? that supposed to be him he looked a lot nicer

546
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,040
And

547
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,280
She got a little bit of paint on her head

548
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,510
and then

549
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,340
Daddy wore a tracksuit and no one was happy about it

550
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,880
And then daddy

551
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,720
Had it

552
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:13,000
Hey, I lost my arm? Oh my god

553
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:24,260
Alright let's put it back

554
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:32,540
I wasn't hit by a car. I knew it

555
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,330
Alice in wonderlaaand

556
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:43,160
it was written by an author in Brighton I think, someone told me I don't know if it's true. I rib in Brighton

557
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,730
there's a lot of like, I don't know if this is true, but there's a lot of

558
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,320
people someone built it like a tunnel to the beach and

559
00:44:51,320 --> 00:45:00,580
I don't know if it's true. It sounds like a lie, the more I think about it. I'm like that tunnel was

560
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,540
Inspired Alice, I don't know clean bathroom.

561
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:11,900
I mean we've done this much might as well and I'm sure you love hearing me talk about some gibberish

562
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:18,530
So why the heck not there you go shampoo tidy

563
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:30,880
Then the more I think about it you don't need an Android really you just need a woman I'm joking. It was a joke

564
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,060
That's a tiny ass mop that's not gonna

565
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,260
My god, this is so awkward

566
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,780
Why is it.. what are you?

567
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:52,280
Oh, I have to constantly rub it

568
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,920
OK we've dabbed on all the germs

569
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,460
It says it's time to move on Felix. Okay my god

570
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:11,120
Just trying to make the most out of the game I'm truly enjoying it. It's really fun.

571
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:19,520
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing

572
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,980
Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,720
yes

574
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:54,640
Well, you can afford the Android.

575
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:09,600
♪ I love Todd, Todd's the best ♪

576
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,780
Where's the dab button

577
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,600
If there's not one moment in this game where there will be a moment to dab

578
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:24,420
I'm going to be so disappointed. Here we go. Oh, look at that I missed one. No

579
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,160
No, damn it

580
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,620
Grr I'm so angrry

581
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:37,880
All right, let's keep playing we'll do one more we'll do one more. Okay one more one more come on come on

582
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:46,580
7:00 a.m. It's not even waking up in the morning

583
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:55,390
Cyberlife created by Mark Zuckerberg

584
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,940
Whoa

585
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,870
What if you were so rich you can you just have an army of androids that was so epic

586
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:05,350
And then you can fight them like Pokemon

587
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,510
That would be so awesome

588
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,360
That is so awkward

589
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:19,000
See if you could invent Androids surely you could invent pokemon

590
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,840
Carl I bet Carl is gonna be a total doofus any rich kid is a total doofus

591
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:35,020
What is this on the wall? Oh, it's one of those elevators

592
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,100
Doofus

593
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:44,440
Where is my doofus? &quot;Wake up Carl upstairs&quot; I am upstairs, aren't I?

594
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,200
Hey an ancient fossil in your home just like everyone has

595
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,360
WHOA Sliding doors, epic!

596
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,440
Is Carl...old?

597
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,600
*gasp* Carl is OLD

598
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:26,160
And he's got tattoos.

599
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,420
You don't forget?

600
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,280
Oh my god, that's what I said

601
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:40,500
So when is the painting meme coming because I feel like once once we've done that we can finish the let's play right

602
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:46,900
That's the reason

603
00:49:46,900 --> 00:50:30,660
Carl!

604
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,500
It's the first one that's nice too an Android so far. This is so nice.

605
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:42,380
I misjudged Carl I feel terrible.

606
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,320
uh-oh

607
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,780
Please don't make me do that

608
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:55,980
Have you guys seen the movie &quot;her&quot; it's a really good movie about the relationship between humans and

609
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:03,800
I Guess artificial intelligence or AI or Android. I wonder if there will be like close relationships in

610
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,840
the game

611
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,640
Like that

612
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,100
that is an ugly cat

613
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:20,280
What is this move I have to

614
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:29,960
It's got a good atmosphere this game as well

615
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,800
I Don't like Carl's art

616
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:47,820
Just gonna say it right now

617
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,360
Do we put him on the elevator now?

618
00:51:51,360 --> 00:52:01,500
Or, do we get the option to push him down?

619
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,940
That's so cool.

620
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,280
Whoa it's so fast

621
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,520
He's faster than I am. I want one [chuckles]

622
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:24,160
Okay, do I do I push you again yeah cool I teleport behind that's always nice

623
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,680
Sliding doors

624
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,940
Whoa. What a cool TV

625
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,400
Well, you're welcome

626
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:44,640
That's what I said

627
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,780
Okay oh are we making them?

628
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,080
breakfast, or??

629
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,820
Don't know how to make

630
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,720
Scrambled eggs, I don't like eggs.

631
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,960
I already made it. Thank God. whew

632
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,740
I'm sure the game would have completely ruined me

633
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,500
Okay, what's up with the mug

634
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,080
It's that from his kid or something

635
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:27,580
He has one of those water on the wall things. That's how you know you're rich

636
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:33,710
Et voila!

637
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:40,360
If he's unhealthy, is it really a good idea to give him bacon and egg when you're this old? just a question

638
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,360
Okay, just have some porridge. some good old porridge. delicious

639
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:53,240
Makes you poop right after it's great

640
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,060
Eat the fruits Carl

641
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,100
That's a two-sided television that's epic

642
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:08,860
something to do [chuckles] what am I gonna do?

643
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:16,280
In the other games there was like internal dialogues when you were lost.. I guess they don't have it

644
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,680
North Pole why Russia wants it

645
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,340
We need dominance in space

646
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,220
life found on Titan

647
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,990
alien life

648
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,410
Where are you going with this?

649
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:40,509
What is Titan

650
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:43,839
That's pretty cool

651
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,309

652
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:47,940
mankind is so depressing

653
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:58,260
Well, I guess nothing change in the future

654
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:03,000
Wait

655
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,309
What year is it?

656
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:13,749
My man, on that whiskey

657
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:20,499
Is that's supposed to be- no, it's just fakes ones. I thought maybe they would do some parody ones

658
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:22,920
Like in anime

659
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,340
Alright, let's play the perfect piano then

660
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,320

pere pere pere pere pe pe reepo

664
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:42,400
Melancholic hopeful intimate. Well, he's feeling a little

665
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,980

Oh my god can't wait I'm finally going to see what the painting is

677
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:34,220
After all this time

678
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:41,940
What in the world is happening now

679
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:50,380
