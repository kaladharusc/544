00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,449
paintbrush I don't know if this is you

3
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,480
know work but if it does this white

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,770
piece of paper should spell the letter

5
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,270
10 ready see the see the lemon juice is

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,860
supposed to burn at a higher lower

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,780
temperature than the rest of the paper

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,520
which in theory should make it act like

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,000
disappearing ink or something but he's

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,260
totally work look at that number 10

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,190
written in spying also known as lemon

13
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,590
whatever dealing with anything flammable

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,140
or combustible so it's very important to

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,700
make sure you have a fire extinguisher

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,689
nearby now my fire extinguisher is empty

17
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,430
so you always want to make sure you

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,520
check it to make sure it's not empty

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,200
fortunately this blew out all by it this

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,170
video is kind of a nothing video mostly

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,970
I just wanted to bring you up to speed

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,670
share with you you know when I'm daily

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,929
vlogging you know I feel like there's a

24
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,490
really great opportunity to have an

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,310
open-ended conversation with you the

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,869
audience bringing you up to speed with

27
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,840
what I'm up to in my life and my channel

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,819
ambitions and everything else but now

29
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,630
that I post irregularly irregular I

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,709
don't feel like I have that calm I don't

31
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:53,970
feel like I have that opportunity so

32
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,250
this is just like a good old-fashioned

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,400
update video

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,530
ten things ten things I need to bring

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,200
you up to speed on number one if you

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,480
send me a letter or maybe or maybe a

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,350
package helmet or a futuristic fan and

38
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,510
you haven't received a thank-you from me

39
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,850
please know that I am working on it I

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,220
just I get a lot which I appreciate

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,440
and it takes me a long time to get

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,910
through all of these you know for what

43
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,410
it's worth a lot of my youtuber friends

44
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,850
told me that they've shut down their Pio

45
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,830
boxes and stuff this just becomes too

46
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,560
much of a hassle I do not see it as a

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,019
hassle I love receiving packages in mail

48
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,700
I just try to be realistic with update

49
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,680
number two I haven't shaved in about a

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,200
week I'm not one for facial hair but I

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,010
had a really good excuse for all of the

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,410
last week I've been on this like it was

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,420
like a romantic because it was Candace

54
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,620
and me but we had a bunch of our friends

55
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,190
with us but no children no babies we

56
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,319
left them at home with Candace's parents

57
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,870
but I'm like this crazy wild romantic

58
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,079
honeymoon like vacation we all went on a

59
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,850
cruise through like the Caribbean and we

60
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,290
stopped these islands and went for like

61
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,720
hikes and then at night we can decide

62
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,010
midway in almost a year and a half

63
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,870
without the kid oh it was amazing

64
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,060
I didn't shoot any video about it but it

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,680
was such a wild experience I feel like I

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,750
have to make a movie about it somehow so

67
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,600
I might try to get all of like the cell

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,100
phone clips that everybody took on that

69
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,959
trip and turn that into a video but yeah

70
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,820
I grew some facial hair and got this

71
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,040
fantastic tan I'm a romantic holiday

[Music]

74
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,019
my holiday video a little bit about that

75
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,390
video if you haven't seen it we you know

76
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,769
every year Samsung wants me to do a big

77
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,049
video with them and they are willing to

78
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,629
kind of support whatever crazy idea I

79
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,060
have and last year's about me dressing

80
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,349
up a Santa and flying around on the

81
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:12,409
snowboard behind a drone

82
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,430
this year I want to do something it was

83
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,620
much more about giving back if you

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,789
haven't seen it we turned an old

85
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,259
shopping mall it's like this winter

86
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,120
wonderland then we invited like a

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,190
hundred plus underprivileged kids to

88
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,810
come there and make youtube videos with

89
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,199
us

90
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,509
it is opportunities like that and

91
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,120
getting to do like that that is the very

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,610
reason why I want to be a youtuber and

93
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,860
I'm psyched to be a youtuber it wasn't

94
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,780
just me either we had there were 18

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,370
youtubers that we flew in from like

96
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,199
around the country around the world to

97
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,630
help us realize this thing and you know

98
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,310
all of it was to benefit the Boys and

99
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,840
Girls Club which is an organization that

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,430
helps underprivileged kids that don't

101
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,320
have much to do after school and they've

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,849
received a whole bunch of attention by

103
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,229
the way I'll link them below if you want

104
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,349
to make a donation or just go say hi

105
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:57,210
unbelievable organization but that was

106
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,430
my holiday video thank you for just the

107
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,530
overwhelming support especially thank

108
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,490
you from the girls and boys merch this

109
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,500
merch my current merch store you know I

110
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,180
have three items for sale this is an

111
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,099
experiment this is something I wanted to

112
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,289
see if there was interest in I wanted to

113
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,289
see if I liked the process and the short

114
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:19,020
answer to all that is this is awesome

115
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,789
and I want to be more than just t-shirts

116
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,440
and sweatshirts I want to figure out how

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,620
to like how to have like a place where I

118
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,780
can sell all the crap that I'm

119
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,039
interested in that maybe you're

120
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,039
interested in a place where I can work

121
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,169
with like nonprofits to raise all the

122
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,180
money and do fundraisers that I like to

123
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,639
do a place that's like I don't like a

124
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
big fat commerce site or online commerce

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,440
place where I can do more than just sell

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,419
t-shirts and sweatshirts maybe I've been

127
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,710
spending too much time my friend Peter

128
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,930
McKinnon but in 2018 not to make much

129
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,570
more of an effort to make the process of

130
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,909
creating a bigger part of mine of my

131
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,070
video narrative it's something I talked

132
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,520
a lot about like in 2000 season one of

133
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,780
the bloggers I talked a lot about the

134
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,310
gear I use and how I got the shots that

135
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,080
I got I've gotten away from that I only

136
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,270
get back to that just as a quick nod to

137
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,250
that you'll notice that this video and

138
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,750
the videos that I'll be posting in the

139
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,500
near future anyways are not 4k I've gone

140
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,690
back to 1080 instead I'm trying to focus

141
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,849
on a sharper focus and a shallower depth

142
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,279
of field I want to make these videos a

143
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,150
little bit more cinematic in order

144
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,700
to do that I'm letting go of the higher

145
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,860
resolution and I'm embracing sort of

146
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,560
better dynamic range in better color

147
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,140
science and and the kinds of aesthetic

148
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,270
values that I prioritize during the

149
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:44,020
first season of my vlog and that brings

150
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,760
up one of the bigger questions that I

151
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,160
asked myself especially looking to the

152
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,680
future and that is what is this channel

153
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,320
you know a year ago at this time I just

154
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,900
stopped vlogging CNN just bought my

155
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,110
company I had no idea what 2017 might

156
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,230
bring in 2017 for me was a bit of a

157
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,330
scramble like I I wasn't sure where this

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,700
channel fit in I started vlogging again

159
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,230
but that didn't feel rights that I just

160
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,880
went to uploading with some consistency

161
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,790
but then I would sit it was a mess and

162
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,380
when I looked at 2018

163
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,300
I don't specifically know what I want to

164
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,700
do but I do know that regular uploads

165
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,010
and having a very specific sort of

166
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,290
narrative agenda behind this channel is

167
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,000
going to be a priority of mine I just

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,980
think for my own well-being like when I

169
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,660
told myself the first season of the vlog

170
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,520
was gonna post a video every single day

171
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,740
no matter what that was such like good

172
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,170
guidance for me it was very helpful for

173
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,600
me creatively and I want to kind of give

174
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,710
myself a mission like that for 2018 with

175
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,630
this YouTube channel this closet the

176
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,300
podcast we're doing it a hundred percent

177
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,400
guaranteed positively fully committed

178
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,320
we're doing the podcast we just want to

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,300
rush into it we're gonna do it in 2018

180
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,370
in January a few weeks from now but we

181
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,630
needed to take this time to figure out

182
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,240
how to do it best practices do we get a

183
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,890
studio to be knocking the studio sound

184
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,750
quality distribution methods all those

185
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,180
things we're figuring out right now but

186
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,040
we're doing it the immediate future so

187
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,420
like I said I was on that romantic

188
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,940
vacation for the last week no vlogging

189
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,680
for that no making videos for that I

190
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,630
leave in two more days for another trip

191
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,520
this is a family trip we're going to see

192
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,710
Candace's family it's like a big thing

193
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,480
I'll be gone for another like 8 or 10

194
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,550
days or something I want to try and not

195
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,980
make videos while I'm there as well I

196
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,140
find taking these big breaks lets my

197
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,910
brain clear up and it lets me enjoy my

198
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,680
time with my family but that doesn't

199
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,120
mean I'm not going to upload

200
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,500
