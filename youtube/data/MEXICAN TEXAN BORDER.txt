00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,380
it's 6:30 in the morning Brett this

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,990
house in Marfa Texas everybody's asleep

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,260
except for me and Daniel here we're up

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,840
so we can go for a quick run before we

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:39,899
start the day getting ready to push off

7
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,210
now it saves me a long day of location

8
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,239
scouting this is like honestly what is

9
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,719
that day I mean they say it's a mass but

10
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,360
it looks more like that so we're right

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,879
here

12
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:06,900
this is Mexico yeah this interest is all

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,869
women

14
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:16,890
the road now I can remember were and

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,450
this was the road like the Halloween

16
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,189
Havoc up turn hours really this is so

17
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,500
now we're on the dirt road the next stop

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,780
is the Mexican border of the Rio Grande

19
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,119
but what we're doing here today is we're

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,520
doing more location scouting for Max's

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,880
movie max made do what you can with me

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,399
earlier this year now I'm helping him

23
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,369
with his doing you can't movie it sort

24
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,350
of begins with a crazy idea where we

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,869
need a long stretch of road and today's

26
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,459
location scouting is to find that

27
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,039
perfect long stretch of road I don't

28
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,750
think that's

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:23,030
reconnaissance here let's go find it

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,580
okay I must be really rusty am i

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,500
drowning or something so I can't find

new york city anymore i haven't been in

35
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,310
the blogs much I've crashed it three

36
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,500
times today and I just crashed into a

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,580
telephone wire any sign of it village

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,560
it's gotta be around here in this rock

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,330
formation I think is what we do there's

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,890
got to be there what that means boom

41
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,750
boom it's right there

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,160
you buy that I mean seems fine just

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,870
broke its leg this broke off

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,660
aggressively I guarantee you this thing

45
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,700
still works should not explain the whole

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,560
idea for Max's movie the requires

47
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,910
shooting out of the window of a cause

48
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,260
it's moving at a certain speed to

49
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,600
capture you guys going to test it with

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,540
the stabilizer here they come

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,290
is there using the stabilizer to see if

52
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,930
they can get a stable shot of the window

53
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,540
of this car traveling at that speed I

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,090
mean that's where it in the animation is

55
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,850
playing in here right that's pretty

56
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,340
smooth it's pretty smooth yeah you can't

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,620
tell that especially if that's not like

58
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,480
that's not the best stabilizer either

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,330
right if this is not the best one it's

60
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,050
not that we're getting Travis okay this

61
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,160
room is not going to work it's now long

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,200
enough stretch and it's not too bumpy

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,209
you gotta slow down a little big

64
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,569
question uh-huh

65
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:58,239
gas station about three hours away I

66
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,520
give this road like a be mine okay and

73
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,910
to the border there'll be a more like

74
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,650
open road that's more interesting

75
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,020
looking so we're headed to the border of

road we're going to pick a road that's

115
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,000
going to tell us a story and the only

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,040
way we can see that story is by

road and the story that that road is

119
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,330
going to tell us is about where it is in
