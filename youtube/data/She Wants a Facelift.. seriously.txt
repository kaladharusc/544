1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:16,430
yeah yeah yeah

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:31,740
just knocked over an entire flower pot worth of water on the table with all of

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,360
my electronics on it

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,880
look at the stuff also I think we're going to go to the museum now it's

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,880
cloudy out today

7
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,140
forgot the blades I took it apart

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,180
I put it in my backpack i spilt the plant water all over everything and I

9
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,270
didn't bring the

10
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:20,570
stop the blades how do i forget the copter blades saw them so excited father

11
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:35,569
so excited for my drug let's set it up and I forgot all the blades because i

12
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,240
was rushing out of the house where I knocked over that plant and all the

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,240
water flooded all of the electronics

14
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,370
clear on the table

15
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,370
we used to have tools we all the tortoise is now or never

16
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,830
that's right thing you want to say

17
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,049
just say something funny side and so people think say nice things about you

18
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,200
in the block

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,300
everybody always says smile yeah

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,560
SI tenes always loved the trouble is this is what she looks like when she

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,540
smiles it's not super pretty

22
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,540
so we prefer just look like this like normal Candace

23
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm not kidding canvas talk about getting a facelift and I told her this

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,930
is what she would look like if she thinks you can talk about getting a

25
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,950
facelift

26
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,980
you said Botox i know i said i wanted to get this at least children all

27
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,980
don't do that

28
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,010
Candice and her mom and her on the

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,740

30
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,950
I didn't have to work my friend nick is on his way here to get me

31
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,060
we are going to go on a little height of nature height our plan was to hike up by

32
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,920
Lions heads currently consumed by a gigantic cloud

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,370
so you can't see it into those clouds

34
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:07,830
yeah well that's where that's only one do this is you at the end of the year

35
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,890
where the hell did you guys go I think we took a detour by Madagascar and then

36
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,880
we're going up

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,230

57
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,250
very drone heavy because i just got this thing until I crash it into a body of

58
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,910
water

59
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,630
