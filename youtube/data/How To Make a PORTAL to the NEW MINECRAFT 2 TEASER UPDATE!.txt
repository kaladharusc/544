hey guys what's up to me the lux welcome

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,380
back to another minecraft video today we

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,970
got how to do minecraft - how you know -

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,240
entities how to get minecraft to because

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,200
they're gonna be releasing it pretty

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
soon so basically we want to generate a

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,310
new world with the seed minecraft space

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,300
- this is a hundred percent legit they

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,880
just recently released this update and

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,490
it's you have to do it very specifically

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,830
because you actually get a little teaser

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,380
on minecraft - the game that they're

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,550
working on then they're going to be

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,910
releasing next year it's absolutely

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,370
crazy this update not very many people

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,520
know about it and but I got I saw a

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,980
reddit post that just happened before it

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,239
blew up and I just thought I had to make

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,160
a video I had to make a video about this

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,960
so basically we spawned in this world

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,370
and you see there's already a little uh

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,460
you know whole crater down here now this

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,260
is very important you're gonna want to

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,300
get your obsidian and unexpected you are

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,350
going to need for their blocks from each

26
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,330
corner of the portal the very original

27
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,090
blocks in Minecraft is dirt blocks it

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,280
was the first thing not coded was the

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,740
dirt blocks and so the next thing you're

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,270
gonna want to do is you're gonna want to

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,520
go down the little tiny crater down here

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,430
and you see this flat little surface

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,530
it's almost perfect spot for a portal

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,600
this is what the seed provides it has to

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,759
be this specific spot or it will not

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
work so let's go ahead and make the

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,290
portal with the with the dirt blocks

38
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,970
just like this just like this we're

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,560
gonna place the last two there blocks

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,020
put the portal and now we're gonna have

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,299
to start the portal but you got to make

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,399
sure it's nice and flush against there

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,299
and it like it almost fits perfectly and

44
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,890
you got to make sure the dirt blocks are

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,990
definitely there all right now we're

46
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,610
gonna have to find the the next

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,170
important part which is part of this

48
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,600
minecraft seed you see this little area

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,920
right here right in the center of it

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,170
let's break it and boom there's

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,820
magically a chest right there it's a

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,960
it's a little flint and steel called

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,780
notch too and we're gonna go ahead and

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,650
start this up and get right in

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,180
to it we're gonna we're gonna go to

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,519
Minecraft to guys it's absolutely cool

57
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,760

next giant thing on YouTube and I'm

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,709
