2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,349
these are German bombers in a movie

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,820
about some British kids escaping the war

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,530
into a mythical realm do we really need

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,820
sky captain in the world of yesterday

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,680
footage of these bombers maybe this is

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,420
why the movie is 2 hours 23 minutes long

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,980
this intense opening is meant to give us

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,840
context but it also builds a connection

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,039
to their home and their mother that the

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,750
movie will never revisit or resolve for

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,130
its entire two and a half hours you know

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,090
what else could get you killed beter

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,770
leaving that bunker door open just so

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,910
you can chastise your little brother

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,649
shut the door when boarding a train

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,690
please make sure to inform us if you are

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,399
starring in a film so you can be seated

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,020
my window on the station side for

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,730
maximum waving effect thank you and

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,500
enjoy your evacuation you won't listen

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,309
to your brother waiting Edmund you go

23
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,890
okay I will but um do you mean

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,899
emotionally like Dakota Fanning and man

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,910
on fire or do you mean physically like

26
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,859
ATS Monica on fronts or do you mean

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,600
spiritually like that will writer chick

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,059
movie isn't the Screwtape Letters mrs.

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,489
MacCready I'm afraid so

30
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,570
let me spend so much time Oliver

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,040
twisting an an of Green Gables I'm

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,360
beginning to wonder if it's ever going

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,900
to go narnia chronicling and above all

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,869
there should be no disturbing off the

35
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,090
professor oh now I understand this too

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,680
long setup they're hoping to create and

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,720
Norn your hurts which I guess they kind

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,000
of do for another movie or two why don't

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,830
I forget how it all worked out was it

40
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,920
Latin worst game ever invented Edmund is

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,329
such a miserable whiny little bastard

42
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,890
always correcting everyone and pointing

43
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,049
out the mistakes and hey random and

44
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,490
convenient completely empty chest is

45
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,509
both random and convenient she ran

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,950
through at least two hallways and is at

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,210
the far end of this room with the door

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,689
closed

49
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,399
I doubt she's hearing Peter at all Lucy

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,960
accidentally south into Narnia is

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,850
wandering into a fantasy world a common

52
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,290
occurrence for Lucy she doesn't seem

53
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,549
shocked or scared at all that this

54
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,810
closet led to some sort of winter

55
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,280
wonderland how is she at least not

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,630
running back the way she came at this

57
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,009
point to inspect what happened and

58
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,869
without proper orienteering skills and

59
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,219
basic intelligence Lucy died of

60
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,509
hypothermia long before the game of

61
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,189
hide-and-seek was over Lucy's left hand

62
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,869
touches the pole but an immediate cut

63
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,550
away shows it's her right hand and then

64
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,020
immediately her left again I haven't

65
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,849
seen pole work that fast since well

66
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,010
never mind

67
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,810
yes Losey be very afraid I've seen what

68
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,519
james mcavoy does when he's in beast

69
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,870
mode and you don't want any part of it

70
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,189
did this movie even have a continuity

71
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,659
Department the fingerprints are

72
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,950
different in almost every shot the

73
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,360
packages are in different places than

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,769
they land and if we track every

75
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,879
continuity error through this whole

76
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,110
thing we'll be here longer than a

77
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,450
Narnian winter let's just add 15 sins

78
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,370
and call it a day and from our fallen

79
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,200
fashion line we call this the topless

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,700
scarf look for when you have to keep

81
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,140
your neck warm and your nipples hard at

82
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,540
the same time and also most annoying

83
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,940
from from the lamppost all the way to

84
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,190
Castle CAIR Paravel on the eastern ocean

85
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,010
every stick and stone you see is not a

86
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,760
fun swimming why would she think she's

87
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,290
still in the wardrobe confusion about

88
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,510
where she is exactly sure but she does

89
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,829
know the difference between indoors and

90
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,769
outdoors right I would be if you came

91
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,599
and had tea with me well it would be

92
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,040
sort of like a kidnapping and an Amber

93
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,629
Alert would be issue lucy accepts the

94
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,099
half naked strangers invite to tee

95
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,810
further ignoring her siblings and how

96
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,980
many rules of hide-and-seek she's

97
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,599
breaking this entire movies events could

98
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,889
be avoided if Lucy would just act her

99
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,540
age and get scared of the snowscape and

100
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,949
goat stranger and run back through the

101
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:23,590
Wardrobe into the mansion in the dead of

102
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,510
winter are they frozen bucketloads I

103
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,220
read these books as a kid and loved them

104
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,750
I saw this movie isn't adult and thought

105
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,159
it was fine I'm watching this movie now

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,870
as a sinner God Almighty it's downright

107
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,209
insufferable other than the frostbite

108
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,120
you mean yeah I'm awesome

house for tea then psychedelic fluting

113
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,680
why would whatever magic powers this

114
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,570
thing has not let the siblings get to

115
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,980
narnia now if it's just gonna let them

116
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,270
do it the next time God even the

117
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,620
Wardrobe itself is involved in the

118
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,180
scheme to pad the runtime if she knows

119
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,680
she's going back to Narnia wouldn't she

120
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
do more to prepare then just slide some

121
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,580
boots on maybe a jacket huh some fun

122
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,290
repellent so Lucy comes through to

123
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,580
Narnia and immediately meets good guy

124
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,440
Tumnus Bombadil Edmund comes through

125
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,970
Narnia in the same spot mind you and

126
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,100
immediately meets bad guy Ice Queen its

127
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,810
Narnia super fucking tiny or just super

128
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,130
fucking convenient anything you'd like

129
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,030

candy on Edmund I'm not sure who the

135
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,070
Nanyan version of Chris Hansen is but

136
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,810
they suck at their job grumpy dwarf as a

137

telling the truth

old goofy and confusing guy who likes to

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,500
smoke a pipe gives the small hero's

141
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,880
advice while seemingly just babbling

142
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,620
about gibberish again I'm not sure who

143
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,090
got there first but it's clear as day

144
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,500
Lewis and Tolkien we're writing their

145

make that snowball her hands are empty

149

the whole time snowball fight really

151
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,080
it's your first time in a magical land

152
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,730
fully contained inside a wardrobe not

153

your first time seeing snow you dolt 30

154
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,540
seconds of filmmaking tricks designed to

155

make viewers scared and nervous only to

156
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,840
introduce a goddamn beaver it was a good

157
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,310
guy that will go in to help them this is

158
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,600
the movies version of a time-wasting

159
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,780
jump scare I can assume any

160
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,580
english-speaking upright-walking beaver

161
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,320
behaves completely like an actual beaver

162
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
for no apparent reason especially

163
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,020
considering beavers likely never met an

164
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,340
actual beaver to know how to beaver in

165
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,080
the first beaver beaver anything Susan

166
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,990
would be excellent at anthropomorphisms

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,140
of wood I'm just saying don't borrow a

169
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,400
faulty crock pot from the neighbors

170
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,410
that's all hmm large dam element of

171
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:35,740
danger

172
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,930
talking beavers sardines this movie has

173
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,340
most of my sexual fantasies all rolled

174
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,270
into one scene y would be ver think that

175
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,919
they knew this and we're joking he knows

176
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,510
they're not from here right they don't

177
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,850
even know about the prophecy prophecies

178
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,840
you know that

179
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,760
righty-right poem Nancy it's time the

180
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,470
four of us we're getting home at but

181
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,720
damn room is in no damn way big enough

182
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,220
for Edmund to have made his damn escape

183
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,750
without being seen these doors seemed a

184
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,490
bit impractical Edmund is a punk-ass

185
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,290
little bitch already ditched his family

186
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,700
and raced to the obviously Evil Queen

187
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,380
because she has some candy walks through

188
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,419
a field of statues that to me the casual

189
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,460
observer are clearly Medusa style frozen

190
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,110
real creatures and draws glasses in a

191
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,270
mustache on one Edmund spoopy should

192
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,410
have been called Chronicles of Narnia

193
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,900
Edmund is a pants also movie has time

194
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,290
for this

195
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,590
my apologies fortunate favourite of the

196
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,970
Queen or else not so fortunate jeez well

197
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,530
if you're gonna sinisterly for shout of

198
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,820
the Queen's evil intentions at least

199
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,350
wait until you're out of Edmonds earshot

200
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,210
to do so honestly I wrote narae's

201
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,740
several jokes about this line but

202
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,880
ultimately I can't shake the thought

203
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,830
that this way for your num-nums would

204
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,470
make an excellent band there man how

205
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,880
many movies is Liam Neeson in we're a

206
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,330
pack of wolves are the bad guys

207
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,500
movie Chiefs like my college girlfriend

208
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,060
here and it makes me furious because the

209
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,530
kids in Beaver are already gone when the

210
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,850
wolves show up but to keep the audience

211
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,620
surprised they edited the footage to

212
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,760
make it look like the Wolves had shown

213
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,289
up before they got away basically they

214
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,910
edited this with the editorial hand of a

215
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,440
keeping up with the kardashians show run

216
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
it's a good thing the Biebs built this

217
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,350
escape tunnel big enough for humans to

218
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,550
run through that's some pretty

219
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,990
impressive foresight I tell ya this

220
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,729
peril is a too small to cover the

221
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,680
opening be too light to not easily be

222
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,810
moved and see rollable this in no way

223
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,430
better is their predicament ah the old

224
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,110
hide high up in a tree and hope you can

225
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,729
remain quiet routine never mind how the

226
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,740
fuck they got up there so fast he ran

227
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,430
north smell them out if you can smell

228
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,990
them out why do you need his help with

229
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,639
the direction why can't you smell them

230
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,169
since they're really close near Rock the

231
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,600
time is short and esslyn himself has

232
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,760
asked me to gather more troops Fox News

233
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,710
I see they shot the scene on

234
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,110
green-screen mountain that Aslan's camp

235
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,530
is near the stone table just across the

236
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,690
frozen river awesome how the fuck do you

237
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,010
know that your own wife was shocked a

238
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,450
few minutes ago to meet a fox that had

239
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,400
met Aslan yeah you know the exact route

240
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,840
and location of the secret camp is this

241
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,820
coincidence or just a Bieber marriage so

242
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,139
torn apart by lies and distrust that

243
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,120
divorce is imminent long journey such

244
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,190
arduous Ness sole finish ship here's a

245
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,960
jump scare chase scene that has all the

246
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,580
tension of a genuinely scary moment

247
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,960
except that it ends with Santa Claus yep

248
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,759
santa claus as a movie ever jumped the

249
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,440
shark at its own halfway point i put up

250
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,030
with a lot since I got here

251
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,500
thing I said while watching the film

252
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
somehow went back in time and became

253
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,900
aligned in the script

254
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,639
Santa gives each human child a special

255
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,349
gift I'll allow the Wizard of Oz and I'm

256
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:19,940
suddenly starting to wonder if CS Lewis

257
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,319
was just really good at paying close

258
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,880
attention to other works of fiction that

259
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,349
captured the public's imagination also

260
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:25,880
it would've been hilarious if he gave

261
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,530
three of them cool swords and helmets

262
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,449
but then gave the last one a lame gift

263
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,229
like oh man socks trust in this boo and

264
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,419
it will not easily miss did the prophecy

265
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,620
about the humans on the throne say

266
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,789
anything about all the mythical and

267
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,169
magical help they would receive on their

268
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,020
way there what is happening right now a

269
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,820
frozen river while Lucy and the gang

270
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,380
pass flowering trees in the dead of

271
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,970
snowy winter leading me to believe they

272
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,070
inadvertently entered the shimmer have

273
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,510
you absorbed nothing about the prophecy

274
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,860
of Adam's descendants you're supposed to

275
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,310
be smart

276
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,380
look this is a massively super huge army

277
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,029
gathered here whereas that apparently is

278
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,440
and get the ice queen knew nothing of

279
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Aslan's return or his location until

280
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,890
edmund told her gosh she has the worst

281
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,570
informants this unexplained scent or

282
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,950
makes a lot more sense than the one in

283
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,339
bright welcome Peter son of Adam even in

284
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,829
2005 Liam Neeson as Aslan was a bit of

285
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,029
casting that was too on the nose

286
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,980
the evil Gimli torments Edmund for fun

287
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,690
my question is why did they keep him

288
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,200
alive

289
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
and even if keeping him live has a good

290
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,350
excuse why did they bring him along into

291
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,610
battle please don't try to run now we're

292
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,040
tired and we prefer to kill you quickly

293
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,930
do you know because it seems to me

294
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,640
discount can work and the pack had the

295
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,230
upper hand until you blew in all with a

296
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,670
cheap jump scare ground instead of a

297
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,100
surprise attack

298
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,329
there was no way Susan covered that

299
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,829
amount of ground that quickly and got a

300
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,240
blow on that horn before being turned

301
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,980
into a wolf chow is it just me or does

302
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,420
Peter have a bad case of the wobbly

303
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,760
sword Peter in the wolf Peter Lee no

304
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,130
sword well actually mr. Aslan this is a

305
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,230
Disney film so there's not really

306
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,800
anything to clean off of it so before

307
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,970
the ice queen even knew what was

308
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,290
happening this small band of heroes

309
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,579
wiped down her entire camp

310
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:00,200
grabbed Edmund and it still had time to

311
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,880
tie up grumpy man hey we're gonna now

312
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,140
faster than Chinese food

313
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,270
Tony's not gonna be one of tasted okay

314
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,070
but weird is Nanyan toast come from

315
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,990
where does the flower come from why is

316
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,850
the bread so evenly cut do you toast it

317
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,420
on a campfire

318
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,130
it's not like Aslan can buy the bread

319
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,750
down at the local food line the older

320
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,279
sibling takes one turn practicing

321
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,959
archery and because it was Santa that

322
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,279
gave her the skier she ends up being

323
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:19,820
awesome at

324
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,900
and doesn't even need the practice my

325
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,000
name is Philip if the sequel to this

326
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,320
film had been about the life and times

327
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,790
of Philip the horsey they'd still be

328
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,590
making Narnia movies today so did they

329
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,420
do it everyone got up and reacted before

330
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,530
she even disturbed the curtain and

331
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,740
walked out apparently this roar is Magic

332
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,520
Jesus lion for bitch please the passion

333
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,960
of the lion this movie dwells and

334
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,370
lingers on the Jesus character's death

335
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,200
even more than the Bible does Jesus I

336
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,980
mean sorry

337
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:02,900
holy Christ I mean wow oh sure it sounds

338
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,670
all cool until the sensor when I say I

339
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,930
don't like it does an eye roll for my

340
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,670
wife

341
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,620
how does Susan know this I mean did she

342
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,210
take some sort of lion life science

343
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,130
class back at Finchley high she didn't

344
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,600
even take his pulse why is this even

345
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,260
allowed

346
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,970
why did the Ice Queen kill Aslan but

347
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,770
tell her entire army to peace out would

348
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,420
leave that lion body here for others to

349
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,890
mourn him or for him to come back to

350
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,870
life which he's obviously gonna do see

351
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,970
that's third time Susie smartypants

352
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,410
actually has a good point here they just

353
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,820
heard the White Witch say she's coming

354
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,890
to kill them all so maybe cut the bestir

355
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,630
morning short a bit and go give your

356
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,480
buddies a heads up chase treemail you

357
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,510
still my princes I bring grave news on

358
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,090
your sisters literally that's an army

359
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,450
out there it's ready to follow you I

360
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,770
can't cuz I believed you could sodalite

361
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,910
you were literally betraying him up

362
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,780
until a few minutes ago

363
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,040
the reasons I hope are well established

364
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,140
at this point I believe this giant eagle

365
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,000
can just go itself right in the ear

366
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,560
thank God they escaped the dangers of

367
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,270
World War two I'm sure these three are

368
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,100
supposed to be giants but am I alone and

369
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,150
thinking this looks more like three

370
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,010
regular blokes in a bad case of honey i

371
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,720
shrunk the mythical horde this Battle of

372
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,160
Helm's shallow will contain lots of

373
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,630
clanking metal and not a single drop of

374
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,400
blood at least four straight minutes of

375
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,350
battle I've seen done better by more

376
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,120
than one film or franchise the point is

377
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
that this film's biggest sin is

378
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,260
repetitive planus I mean who is actually

379
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,240
surprised by this way too much time

380
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,040
spent with Aslan explaining the table

381
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,540
the markings and does anyone else

382
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,370
remember there's a battle going on

383
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,750
generic we don't have done a better

384
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,430
battle footage once I a slant is alive

385
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,900
this movie becomes predictable as hell

386
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,610
good to see what condescend some help

387
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,200
sure it looks like the sword goes

388
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,580
through the arm here but in the

389
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,350
follow-up shots the sword clearly missed

390
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,700
his arm completely for pete's sake

391
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,850
literally it is finished and by finished

392
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,530
I mean still 20 minutes left in this

393
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,270
movie two more movie sequels and four

394
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,470
other books that still haven't been made

395
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,450
into movies but you know semantics I

396
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,900
give you Queen Lucy skip not only did

397
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,520
this joke conclusion from earlier seem

398
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,870
out of place and takes way too long to

399
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,370
pay off there was no way the charcoal

400
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,480
would have stayed on that line in this

401
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:15,770
long that King Albus Severus Potter you

402
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,390
were named after two headmasters of

403
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,630
Hogwarts and as such there are a few

404
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,520
rules we need to follow

405
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:30,230
there will be no shouting or running you

406
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,230
were to shoot the juice of the fire

407
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,380
flower I'm gonna start beating the view

408
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,140
the next five seconds

409
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:52,760
Lucy Lucy you got some splaining FIFA

410
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:04,160
thank you I just had it stuffed you

411
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,560
can't expect to wield supreme executive

412
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,080
power just cuz some watery tart through

413
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,180
a sword at you don't waste my time with

414
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,370
flattery this is gonna be a total

415
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,000
cluster cuz
