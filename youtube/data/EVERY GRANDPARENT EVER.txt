17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:33,610

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,780
Thank you for spending my last few final months with me

44
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,720
Grandpa, I Wouldn't of missed it for the world

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,709
You know it baffles me that you didn't want me to leave you with any of my money

46
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,060
Because I was going to give you all of it. wait

47
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,580
What? but you assured me that after 10 years of not seeing

48
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,480
Me and then before that the only contact being late-night phone calls in which he would ask for money then never pay me back

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,250
all, you wanted to do was just spend time with me and not my money

50
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,110
Right I was contemplating leaving you all of it in fact

51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,590
I feel you deserve it after all you've been wiping my ass and rubbing my oosing bed sores with ointments

52
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,160
But again you assured me that you wanted none of my material possessions

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,290
So I guess I'll just give it to charity, but don't worry

54
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,060
I was still thinking maybe I would leave you with my estate

55
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,600
Really, what no time to die?

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,040
Grandpa grandpa, NOOO Give me your Home!!!

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,500
