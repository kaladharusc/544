00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,280
Sexy vegan : The reason I got &quot;sexy vegan&quot; tattooed on my face and my chest......

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,860
because both are great things.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,280
I want people to know who I am instantly just looking at me.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,340
*pewds enters* hold- hold- hold on

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,720
By that logic, you might as well tattoo &quot;insane person&quot; on your face!

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,720
cause THAT'S what you ARE.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,600
(clap 2x)

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,100
*expected him to say meme review*

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,780
(amirite?)

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,260
Hello everybody, my name is *brrrrrr*

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,420
and today we are going to talk about the best YouTuber of all time.

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,920
No, I am not talking about me.
I am talking about...

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,820
Sexy.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,660
Vegan.

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,700
*cue dramatic music*

16
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,040
(GAZE UPON THAT FACE!!!)

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,840
He's got the blue hair,

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,520
SV:
Blue eyebrows because blue is my favorite color.

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,120
My mom, she doesn't like the face tattoos, they look-

20
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,460
P: He's got the face tattoos

21
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,480
SV: My mom, she doesn't like the face tattoos

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,260
because I look like a weirdo

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,760
(you ARE a WEIRDO!)

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,280
P: He's ready to go!

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,980
SV: The reason I got &quot;sexy vegan&quot; tattooed on my face and my chest

26
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,060
is because both are

27
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,060
*yea boi* great things and I want people to know

28
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,800
*is this some superhero movie?* who I am instantly, just looking at me

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,060
These tears right here are for the suffering of

30
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,060
*looks like he's high AF*  the over 70 billion animals

31
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
that are (what??) so smart (??) they cannot move??

32
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,060
yes it is

33
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,060
*music*

34
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,040
*music*

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
*brad and brad #2 are really good at editing*

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,520
P: First of all, that's the worst, most asymmetric star I have ever seen

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,000
It looks like a 5 year old could do a better job.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Did he do these tattoos himself?

39
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,100
Like-

40
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,500
SV: Star is super star that I am going to achieve and for pleasure.

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
AND it's for PLEASURE (eyebrow wiggle)
*pewds laughs about sexy vegan*

42
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the star that

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am going to achieve

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,060
AND for PLEASURE

45
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,000
SV: My mom, she doesn't like the

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Face tattoos, I looked like a weirdo (you are, you dummy)

47
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,120
WHAT!
*spagett intensifies*

48
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,780
*pewds snickers*

49
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,220
How  d a r e  your mom say that

50
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,000
and, may I say, you look Fantastic in blue, I'm rocking blue as well

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's the best colour to wear,

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Clearly,

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,960
Finally,

54
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,800
Someone is strong enough

55
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,100
To speak out on these issues, stupid moms.

56
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,920
(Mocking) Don't let me dance

57
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,865
naked on the street!

58
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:51,980
SV: They make movie stars,

59
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,000
like Tom Cruise, but now with the face tattoos,

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,091
I'm more distinct.

61
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm gonna be myself

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and people have to like me for me

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
and that's all there is to it

64
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,720
(Dramatic) I'm NOT gonna CONFORM!

65
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
*more sexy nakey dance*

66
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,460
P: Oh, my God, he is LITERALLY me

67
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,020
Ahehehahaha

68
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,840
An exaggeration of all and my entire being ahahah

69
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,360
Dr. Phil: Well, Raquel says her older brother Sexy

70
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,360
has been banned for life from YouTube
and Craigslist, (uh oh)

71
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,280
thinks he's on par with God-

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,790
P: Wait *gibberish* is Dr. Phil
talking about me right now or what's

73
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,820
happening? This is-

74
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,840
Okay, so, Sexy Vegan has
a YouTube channel, apparently, uh, you upload

75
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,800
one video on YouTube and you
qua- qual- qualify as a- as a YouTuber (TM)

76
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,560
SV: I got sooo fuckin' angry earlier

77
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,780
'Cause I was uh- I was in Fronthide (?) for a little bit

78
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,340
but it wasn't really going so-

79
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,000
*CLICKS TONGUE*

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,520
P: Hey, guys, welcome to my new

81
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,580
uh, update vlog, just uh,

82
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,600
got SOOO anGRY earliER!

83
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,092
*CLICKS TONGUE* CLEARLY, we have a lot to learn from Sexy Vegan

84
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,700
on how to do YouTube properly.

85
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,495
The stylistic choice of filming it in the
wrong aspect ratio...

86
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,700
People just don't do

87
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,049
these bold moves anymore! He's not
conforming, guys, this is it, this is a

88
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,380
quintessential YouTuber (TM) of all time.

89
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,080
Dr. Phil: There's even tattooed his face-

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,180
P: How are we not, talking, about, the eyebrows

91
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,580
Ohhhhhhhhhhh, nooooooooooo

92
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,140
Odd Sister: For the record, I don't call my brother&quot;Sexy,&quot; I call him &quot;SV.&quot;

93
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,160
P: Wait.

94
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,440
*long pause*

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,500
What is &quot;SV?&quot;

96
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,880
SIMPLY, a term for sandy vagina

97
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,280
DAMN, she's a savage

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Becky: Last year, my
brother looked like this handsome guy

99
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,260
but when I've seen his recent
transformation-

100
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,780
P: He transformed from a dog!

101
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,660
Susan: I described my brother as lazy,
unmotivated, crazy

102
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,140
(Law &amp; Order boom) He is a danger to the public.

103
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,200
P: Damn.... That edit really makes it so intense

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,340
(Law &amp; Order boom) Have you guys heard of PewDiePie? He is a danger to all the ethnicities

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,200
Rebecca: My mother has two rules for my brother:

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
don't get arrested,

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
don't do drugs (kids)...

108
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,640
He can't seem to follow either of them.

109
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,069
P: I feel like everyone
knows some person like this to some

110
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,120
extent, just this kid that was WAY too
spoiled as a child and just problematic

111
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,719
and no one really wanted to deal with it, so just kept giving him whatever he

112
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,129
wants, and then it's just turned into this monster. It's wonderful.

113
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:17,320
I love this; I live for this.

114
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,940
Sooo Sexy Vegan or Hans de Bartolo also wrote a

115
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,949
book, uh, called- before his transformation-
called &quot;The Adventures of Fargo Lefty&quot;

116
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:29,380
&quot;Meet Fargo Lefty! Fargo is a handsome, young, vegan writer in his mid-20's who

117
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,420
comes from a wealthy family and lives in his own home his dad bought him.

118
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,960
Fargo has some very cool vegan friends. One is a rich drug-&quot; Honestly I kind of want to read this.

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,680
SV: My name is Sexy Vegan, got my
name legally changed to Sexy Vegan.

120
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,118
&quot;Hans&quot; no longer fits me.

121
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:49,570
P: I think it's a really good move to change your name to Sexy Vegan

122
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:57,130
and especially tattooing it on
your face ESPECIALLY if you haven't

123
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,509
already in the past three years change
identity three or four times from Hans

124
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:09,550
DeBartolo to vegan Hans to sexy vegan
Justin Beiber Charlie Sheen project yeah

125
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,000
so you can follow his whole
transformation online it's all there and

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,699
it's there was the saddest thing I've
ever seen and also hilarious but also

127
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:23,770
hilarious
so I once was down to 1.3 percent body

128
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,460
fat

129
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,340
when I go out everyone stares at me
because I wear a speedo esque outfit and

130
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,870
I'm exotic like a Lamborghini SV
I love walking around my speedos because

131
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,259
putting clothes on is like putting a tarp
over a Lamborghini which makes no sense

132
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,419
&quot;and I get $#*! for that all the time&quot; it just
doesn't make sense that people don't

133
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,470
want to see my naked body because why
wouldn't people see in Lamborghini my

134
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,409
logic is 100% flawless and I just get $#*! for that all the time

135
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:00,069
when I go into a grocery store [..] followed
around by the security which is so

136
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,389
annoying
what is this lines I've watched a lot of

137
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,280
his videos he speaks so differently here
that all the time it's like the

138
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,409
producers are just saying like hey can
you sound more angry wearing my speedo

139
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,400
security will come up and they'll say
sir you have to dress more and I'll be

140
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,140
like &quot;well a hot chick could wear this
outfit&quot;

141
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,840
S- Sorry. Excuse me, sorry, sexy vegan..

142
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,780
your logic is always flawless
and I don't mean to impose,

143
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,860
but I don't think women can go around wearing that.
That's what a Normie would say

144
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,279
Finally we have someone brave like sexy vegan
that isn't afraid to talk about

145
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,340
controversial topics like sexism and
then how it just doesn't unfavored women

146
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,620
and unfavored menace we're okay why
can't girls go around topless with their

147
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,610
nipples X boats and guys can't it's
total black shit so I get kicked out of

148
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:08,440
so many stores I've been arrested 15
times 15 I can make it on my talents I

149
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,800
have several YouTube videos I've been
kicked off a YouTube channel I got

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,060
terminated for over sexual strikes he's
you're wondering what kind of diet this

151
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,219
man is on he made a video and it's the
most repulsive thing is like these fake

152
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,040
fish patties with vegenaise on it and
to be fair vegenaise

153

157

main problem is my mom she does not
believe in me she's very pessimistic

of language in front of my audience an

173
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:32,069
audience I apologize that is childish
and immature behavior and yes you do no

174
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:40,860
don't let the door hit you in the ass I
didn't realize doctor such a gangster so

175
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,980
then a gay couple months later he
returns to apologize to dr. Phil for his

176
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,939
crimes
of twerking on stage my parents are dr.

177
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:55,259
Phil was a total disaster a lost a lost
opportunity the way I behaved was wrong

178
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:00,750
my mom's a sociopathic piece of my
biggest regret is yelling at dr. Phil

179
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:08,579
you look at me yeah I agree
if I had those face tattoos my biggest

180
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:14,370
regret would also be yelling at dr. Phil
definitely that would I totally

181
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,319
understand how that is your biggest
regret 100% and not your face tattoos

182
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:25,079
you only a dr. Phil that's like a
hundred times worse okay so I'm glad we

183
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,319
got that out of the way cuz I was
worried he wasn't gonna acknowledge it I

184
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,740
hated seeing myself you helped my mom I
mean

185
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,450
my mom I disrespect everyone I was I was
I was I said a different strokes for

186
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,310
different folks one of my songs inspired
by dr. feels different strokes for

187
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,240
different folks different strokes for
different folks he said on the show and

188
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,540
stuff oh really
what an originalist song what he he

189
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,580
really used to me isn't he just steals
everything

190
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,330
the answer is everyone's different do
what you do as long as you're not

191
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,830
harming anyone animals and insects - I'm
really sorry

192
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,390
what's the pastime nice for you to
forgive me an Emmy bag we'll have a seat

193
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,820

194

get the idea

195
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,290
dr filiz like well if you care about
animals I love animals so that means you

196
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,510
know that bad of a guy and that kind of
heart has got to be a good guy at the

197
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:30,200
core beside you know you guys should
check out sexy vegan YouTube channel he

198
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,160
definitely needs more subscribers
because I feel like he's ego is just not

199
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,420
big enough that he could really benefit
from some more social media following I

200
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,630
think that could definitely be the best
thing for him right now and not getting

201
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,779
some actual psychiatric help from
experts like dr. Phil for example anyway

202
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,980
that's it for me leave a like if you
enjoyed this video and remember to be

203
00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:16,480
