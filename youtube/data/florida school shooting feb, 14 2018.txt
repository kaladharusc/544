00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,409
below an assistant football coach at

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,240
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,680
died after risking his life to protect

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,030
to protect students from the gunman who

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,850
fatally shot at least 17 people in South

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,140
Florida school Aaron Feist who doubled

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,979
as a school security guard was shot

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,150
after throwing himself in front of was

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,950
shot after throwing himself in front of

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,189
students as the gunman opened fire

33
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,860
Wednesday afternoon as a youth he played

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,780
center for the Douglas Eagles football

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,979
team from 1995 to 1998 after graduating

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,439
he returned to the school in 2002 to

37
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,860
coach and has worked there ever since

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,360
once the attack had ended a student said

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,790
that Feist jumped between her and the

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,079
shooter to push her out to push her out

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,820
through a door and out of the line of

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,880
fire several students offered similar

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,990
accounts saying that Feist was wounded

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,310
while trying to protect people from the

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,739
gunfire Feist was hit several times

46
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,579
covering other students at Douglass

47
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm paraphrasing a lot of this but the

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,459
story then goes on to say some very nice

49
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,420
things about Aaron Feist if I wanted so

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,129

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,209

58
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,430

66
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,469
