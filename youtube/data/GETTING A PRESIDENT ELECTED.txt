1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,289

2
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,449
episode today's episode is going to be different totally different from the

3
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,449
normal episodes i want to add

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,219
that's right this is a special presentation very special episode I'm

5
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,329
going to tell the story I want to tell a story that I've never shared before

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,479
now if you watch the news or read the newspaper or go on the internet or open

7
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,470
your eyes

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,309
I'm sure your keenly aware of what's going on with the presidential election

9
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,210
here in the US of A accept your nomination for the accept your

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,879
nomination and I don't want to get into the politics of it but I think we can

11
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,369
all agree it's not pretty

12
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:08,579
now i do my best to keep this blog as a political as possible I try to film it

13
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,170
all politics from it and talk about things that I think we can all agree on

14
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,390
and today's episode is no different it is about politics but it's not just bear

15
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,079
with me

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,190
the political tenor around the current election is just a mess and I want to

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,540
talk about a time when it wasn't so I want to go all the way back to two

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,540
thousand eight

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:44,350
we're back in two thousand eight I was a much younger version of myself and I

20
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,950
just learned about this young senator from chicago and the first time I heard

21
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,590
him speak I was completely blown away

22
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,950
cut to later that year we're getting really close to the election

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,420

his underwear holding a shotgun saying I'll never vote for

34

37
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:03,829

Barack Obama has one crucial battleground state of Ohio 20

42
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,220
electricity was such an exciting - I immediately left the office i got my

43
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,410
bike and I just started running around the city

44
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,410
this is Union Square

45
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,180
yeah

46
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,420
these were all people cheering because of who was elected for pro try to

47
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,660
imagine that the tenor of politics today

48
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,660
look at this excitement

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
yeah

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,680
it was just like everywhere it was people going nuts

51
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,800
this is times square new york city remember for

52

55
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,740
they make everything official he stands up there ready cheers for him

56
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,430
now look Washington DC is about 225 miles south of here

57
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,210
so of course I zip down to DC where I rendezvous with Graham

58
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,680
almost inauguration time been standing for 77

59
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,700
let's see seven straight hours my back started to hurt

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,030
yeah I've never been in Washington DC before when there was a presidential

61
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,320
inauguration happening but there were just parties everywhere and we went to

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,910
all of them

63
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,639
the same day as well

64
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,139
about that

65
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:28,659
this is a younger 26 year old Casey yeah I'm not the maniac now that I that I was

66
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:29,409
that

67
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,310
and then we knew that our tickets for the actual inauguration put us in a

68
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,389
field where we can be at the front of for all the way in the back so we showed

69
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,789
up at like four in the morning to be the first ones into that field guns please

70
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:45,000
times throughout the year

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,810
yeah

72
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,639
this is when they finally opened the gates and DC police and Secret Service

73
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,700

i'm happy i'm good with words John

83
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,230
I think this is the spot

84
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,530
spot you can see the podium and the big screen

85
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,300
now this was just by chance but that guy over my right shoulder right there that

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,210
is John Singleton the academy award nominated director of boys in the hood

87

89
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,469

93
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,529

94
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,400
whole day and he said when you're an old man and you look back at the day you

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,889
were at barack obama's inauguration

96
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,520
don't you want to see yourself wearing a shirt and tie I'm sorry no strength

97
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,879
morning else I'm sorry that my hand is in your face

98
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,349
I just got to get this you need to use my hand now in red

99
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:45,439
you're going to do it

100
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,870
I think after the inauguration on our way home that happen we fell asleep on

101
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,600
the street or some we were so tired

102
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,090
we did go out that night though the inaugural staff party

103
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,090
jay-z performed

104
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,460
I was super fun night and it ended with graham taking without permission

105
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,180
a presidential seal I mean they're gonna throw it out anyway as he was leaving

106
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,930
with this presidential seal security stopped and they're like what is that

107
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,930
and he showed it to me

108
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,240
and then the security guys just like you're okay have a good night

109
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,390
please go

110
00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:01,420
if I had an epilogue for the story would be that in 2012 Graham my homie

111
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,380
he actually ran for Congress my name is Graham be easy and I approve this

112
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,650
message because you should know that there's a fresh alternative

113
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,670
he lost but he put up a good fight before you were born I was trying to

114
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,390
raise questions about Davis vessels so i cant open auto county would know that

115
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,320
out there is a guy who puts actions behind his words

116
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,320
I probably should have put this message at the beginning of this episode but

117
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,390
save your hate from the comments

118
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,710
this is just about me sharing an experience and to maybe underscores just

119
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,470
how gnarly things are right now in politics

120
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,670
can you imagine seeing that kind of excitement around this election because

121
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,660
I can't
