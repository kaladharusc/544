1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,320
If there is one franchise of movies that have given us so much joy

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:12,180
So much blessing. Who's always been there no matter what. Other franchises might come in. Twilight.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,120
Oh, we're gonna meme Twilight now
shuuutfffuppp

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,440
Black panther might come in oh you can meme shuutttffupppp

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,840
(Angry Voice)
Prequels memes have always been there and will always be there as well.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,390
the Star Wars

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,580
Prequel memes is the most powerful meme franchise of all time, and if you think otherwise then I Got News for you

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,120
You're a dummy dum dum bum

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:57,100
(Awesome Intro)

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,640
Sequel's has the kind of room

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,449
The room status were like literally any line from the damn prequels can be a meme itself

12
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,969
You just say that one line and you'll be like oh where have I heard that. Oh, yeah from the prequels. Oh, that's a meme

13
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,690
hahahahaha
(STARES INTO VIEWERS' SOULS)

14
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,610
Nevertheless me and brad always to have a lot of fun sendingeach other prequel meme

15
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,190
so now you

16
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:22,520
Can go join in on the joke and it will be ruined for everyone as always that's right my admission is to destroy old memes

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,970
when your Padawan starts dealing in absolutes

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,310
Betrays the Republic and slaughter a bunch of children. I hate it when he does that

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,670
it's (laughs)

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,840
When you realize that

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,900
Prequel memes were probably originally originally

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:46,760
Created to mock the cheesiness and stupidity of the prequels and now everyone including yourself loves the prequel even more because of them

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,210
I need to rewatch the prequels. It's been too long

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,660
Dad why was my sister named peace?

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,869
Dad: your mom always thought the world needs peace

26
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:04,370
Thanks dad. No problem Obi-Wan standalone movie starring Ewan McGregor

27
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,140
It is not a bad name, honestly, I would be proud to carry that name

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:16,130
We love what you're doing to help, but no matter the intent our policy is not to run ads on videos about tragedies

29
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,590
The tragedy of dark plague is the Wise HD Star Wars Episode three

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,680
Revenge of the sith

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,200
Wow hypocrisy enough for you YouTube every time I've seen this too many times

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,410
I can't believe they actually lit Hayden Christensen on fire and killed him just for this scene

33
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,310
Such dedication on his part. That's right

34
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,840
He died after this you ever seen Christian Hayden in any other movie after the prequels?

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,120
complete did not just kill his career

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,060
He actually died that's the reason why he was so dedicated to this

37
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,340
What would you choose?

38
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,510
$1,000,000 or

39
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,990
Ewan McGregor unexpectedly jump down behind you at some point in life

40
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,330
and says &quot;Hello there.&quot;

41
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,680
I think the choice is obvious

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,030
I would definitely spend on Ewan McGregor

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:19,260
I would spend you know I spent my entire YouTube fortune on Ewan McGregor just as many times as possible

44
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,240
Hello there.

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,649
Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, Fort Hood

46
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,140
&quot;The Jedi Temple&quot;
(Pewds)What?

47
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,780
Her: I want a divorce I'm so sick and tired of you quoting Star Wars

48
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,880
It's treason then

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,380
(Felix laughing his as* out)

50
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,120
-Crimson?
-Wrong...

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,160
-It's treason then.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,040
Any line from the prequel is a meme

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,980
It's treason ...... then

54
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,360
(Pewds)Like what is that?

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,560
It's treason....then

56
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:12,060
It's treason then

57
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,520
It's treason then

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,640
he jumps back up

59
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,220
OH..!(laughs again)

60
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,040
Thought I saw that one

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:31,120
Can we, I told you, can we literally can we use literally any word from star wars (laughs) and make it a meme?

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,410
Possibly

63
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,160
Prequel fans when you make fun of the prequels

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,720
sequel fans when you make fun of the sequels

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,440
The memes just made it worse it ruined one of the greatest franchises of all time, but the memes

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,820
balanced out, it's the most powerful source of life

67
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,749
It's the most powerful currency. 
When you're on r/PrequelMemes prequel memes for three hours

68
00:04:54,749 --> 00:05:02,380
And there's no perhaps the archives are incomplete memes. Impossible perhaps the archives are incomplete

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,950
Glad we have that line out of the way now

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,790
Let's go to all of the other ones George Lucas when the prequel finish

71
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,190
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet, but your kids are gonna. Love it. It's so true.

72
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,300
Well I actually like the prequels as a child at least the first one. I'll admit it, but now I just enjoy it for the pleasure

73
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,440
When you can no longer watch the prequels properly because every scene became a meme

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,680
What have I done? How do you how would you watch it properly anyway?

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,780
When you take your mates phone, and you check his browser history, but you can't find any porn

76
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,549
Impossible!
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

77
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,760
hmmmm. (+twisty effect)

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,900
Perhaps

79
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,480
literally just a picture of Anakin Skywalker

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,960
Made out of pictures of sand.

81
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,600
man he sure looks irritated by that fact. Doesn't he. I don't like sand

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,820
Its coarse

83
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,620
Rough and irritating and it gets everywhere

84
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,250
The

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:12,530
romance in the prequel is one of the finest things ever ever written and acted it you feel the emotion in each single line

86
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,120
I don't like sand. I don't like sand. 
You've heard of Ben Swolo.

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,009
Now get ready for a Qui Gone Gym.
Hot damn that's strong

88
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:28,060
That's a lot of muscle.
When the most up voted posts on r/sequelmemes is now the Senate.

89
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,280
I love democracy 
Don't we all just love

90
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,300
Democracy?
I love democracy.

91
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,560
If this post somehow gets

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,780
131,072

93
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:48,200
131,072 upvotes, I'll post it again with two hundred and sixty two

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,180
thousand one hundred and seventy seven Ewans.

95
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,449
Guys if there's one good thing that we can do out of this video is to upvote this post

96
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:03,680
It's the number two most up voted post we need to get this to one hundred and thirty

97
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,650
Thousand so we can get to see more Ewans we need ever McGregor to act in the new Star Wars movie

98
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,389
We can't have some fake-ass cheap-ass actor playing

99
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,650
Playing obi-wan Kenobi. He's the one and only except

100
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,360
maybe me I feel like I could do it, but I have this feeling that Disney doesn't really like me that much I

101
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,169
have just been getting those vibes, so I should probably step aside for this one. Your thoughts dwell on your mother

102
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,159
My thoughts dwell on your mother. Oh, ho

103
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:41,900
Damn George Lucas really had some savage lines in there man. Some really good writing.
When you realize that

104
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,229
senator is an anagram for

105
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:53,160
treason

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,750
George Lucas was a genius

107
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,990
And underrated mind
If this gets 10,000 up votes. I'll have this image tattooed on my chest

108
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:11,150
Where is it? Where's the proof 
Top three actors that could totally play over one Kenobi in a Star Wars spin-off movie

109
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,210
I don't know if you guys seen any interviews with Ewan McGregor

110
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:22,530
Talking about the Star Wars. He's like the only actor I've seen that talks about the prequels in a way, that's

111
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,260
Loving and endearing everyone else is just talking about him like oh god

112
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:35,100
Let's just pretend that never happened. What would you do for love? I saw this in a commercial today

113
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,680
Not the younglings Anakin not the younglings.

114
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,840
It's over mannequin I have the high ground

115
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
Beautiful!

116

119
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,080
God damn you may not like it, but this is what peak performers look like.

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,720
How girls see height

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,770
six-inch

122
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,700
5 foot 11. This is so true Marzia

123
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,340
keep ridiculing me for this exact same thing.

124
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,620
*scratch record* *freeze-frame*

125
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:25,520
Yeah, that's me and you're probably wondering how I got into this situation

126
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,960
That's good, why don't we not have any do it memes? There has to be.

127
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,860
Oh my god. Oh no.

128
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:48,880
Oh no!

129
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,000
But can you do it?

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,540
But can you do it?

131
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,440
It's over Anakin, I have the high ground.

132
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,440
But can you do this?

133
