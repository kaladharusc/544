1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
but if the exact same that she was bad she was 13 so I don't know if I've made

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,670
this clear not on the blog but Francine our daughter is bad

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,049
she's like manipulative and smart and just like will do whatever it takes to

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,049
get ice cream

5
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,690
I don't know what that smoke was coming from

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,420
news

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,340
I don't

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,590
hope that into the process and sent right

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,090
smoke

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,490
the fact that you

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,490
lunch

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,650
canada have a day to this morning and we have we're having a date so far it's

13
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,650
going pretty well

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,380
they argue with you go back to working with things

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,900
oh this is our second work before we just had through this is our first one

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,860

17
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,690
ok

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:36,150
oh my God all this you did my God look at her

19
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,080
Candace as a rule doesn't come to the studio because she buys it too stressful

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,210
so I let her dig into the Francine archives i keep a pretty tight archive

21
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,780
of cute pictures and videos of friends always together they anyway she's

22
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,520
digging deep

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,850
I'm getting some needed gear i like broke all my gear in the last weekend

24
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,300
away gotta remember those swings gives me nightmares

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,479
we're flying to cape town we take 80 inches that little yeah and I feel back

26
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:17,430
by myself remember look at the if i cant we're gonna watch that are you sure you

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,860
want to yeah there's no one watching it when can this was getting having the

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,930
baby they like film i had my GoPro and I was like I don't want to film the gross

29
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,760
stuff and the doctors like a cowboy in Texas took the camera and film the gross

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,640
stuff I've never looked at it she's looking at it i'm going to hide in here

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:44,910
is that it like like broke my arm broke my microphone was pretty my camera my

32
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,140
backpack

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,020
this is one of the most common problems and if you know a way to fix this let me

34
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,770
know but where the microphone jack goes into the camera sticks out like this

35
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,519
when i put in my background it always breaks by the sound is so often messed

36
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,660
up in my videos

37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,700
luckily i keep a pretty solid inventory of equipment here in the office to suit

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,290
by every so there's some new stuff here

39
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:15,700
but the new equipment arrived when I wasn't here and got a chance to play

40
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,720
with it yet i do want this per watt and pretty

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,340
this is a GoPro selfie step it's still me right now push the button it's going

42
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:36,520
over there me over there over there over there amazing company called speedo

43
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,530
makes these thank you's people for sending them over this is pretty next

44
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,980
level image stabilizer for cell phone and go pro I can't wait he is this

45
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,010
are you watching a nasty stuff are you crying

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,140
regarding microphones I typically use one of two microphones

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,690
I like this I like this road microphone lot solid microphone lately I've also

48
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,220
been using these sure microphones they're great slightly different sound

49
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,710
profile but just as good of a camera

50
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:14,440
more recently sennheiser came out with this microphone i haven't used it yet

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,730
but sanitizer makes great products and I'm really looking forward to this also

52
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,580
i put on these dead cats on this and it really kills any and all wind it's this

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,580
fuzzy thing that gives me sucked clean sound like when I'm riding my skateboard

54
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,460
in the wind talking to Cameron it still sounds good

55
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,460
because this very thing

56
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:51,770
honey we gotta go have fun watching the archives

57
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:03,140
yeah you didn't know your back your back when you get back yesterday actually

58
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,710
each other and I know when we're in venice on our vacation Oscar was also in

59
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,300
Venice and he was literally 200 feet from us and we were able to connect i

60
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
had healed men all right

61
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,260
yeah

62
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:37,530
that pretty much concludes our afternoon date have to head back down relieve the

63
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,150
babysitter in conclusion we went to lunch and then went to lunch and then we

64
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,440
walked in my office and Candice watch the baby videos and now we took a taxi

65
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,560
cab home and i'm not just by the water and just to do nothing except sharing

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,430
space was the best part of the yeah you are so

67
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,020
baby going down for a nap i have to pack i hate packing because i'm terrible at

68
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:26,000
package gotta gotta gotta gotta bring my tuxedo here trouble is I don't know that

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,889
actually have a tuxedo it's ready to this is all right so you always have

70
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:41,270
trouble prioritizing what to bring my tuxedo and my drove

71
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,390
what

72
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:02,020
typically i try not to be cagey about where I'm going or what I'm doing but I

73
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,229
had to promise not to reveal the details of this trip and told monday night at

74
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:14,110
8pm so i cant even sure where I'm going I can't share why I'm doing there

75
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,410
I really need to review all the details soon really soon I just like you know a

76
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,410
day for you to bear with me

77
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,490
yeah

78
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,490
in the drawer to the left of the self

79
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:44,860
you got it right yeah no big deal in other mildly exciting news i'm flying

80
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,910
virgin atlantic sorry never flown virgin atlantic before the line here

81
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,580
virgin is like a mile long so let's sew up this boosted board that while i wait

82
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,389
i bought this bag aftermarket like it wasn't made by boost its made by some I

83
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,389
don't know was expensive though it's completely falling apart of this

84
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,450
the strap ripped off and buckles broke and I had to put these carabiners on as

85
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,590
the plastic ones broke broke over here trying to stitch this back together here

86
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,990
really have nothing but disdain for low quality products and you know the

87
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,880
high-quality booster for back let me know and i don't want a gun bag or like

88
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,570
a pool cue bag that's we made just for boosted boards otherwise it's a nuisance

89
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,600
currently enroute to the Virgin lounge which I've never been to that Candace

90
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,110

112
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:08,320
like in the first part of this episode i complained about microphones and go to

113
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,130
my studio and I get a new microphone and then spontaneously the shot when I go

114
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,810
into the closet the sound gets totally fine and nowhere and that's why I like

115
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,040
okay I like that but you really left that's called peaking lights at the top

116
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,240
I don't know why it does that I changed no settings it like does that on its own

117
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,610
this is why we smash my camera so frustrated when stuff like this sorry

118
