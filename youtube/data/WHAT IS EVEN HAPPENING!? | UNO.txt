two one I'm in mine crash the game so

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,030
long then come out with uno 2.0 I've

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,820
been waiting for you dance is this

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,500

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,930

just dance yeah yeah fuck you I don't

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,179
know what that means I just went for it

17
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,310
that means if they had a blue card you

18
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,930
would have won the challenge and

19
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,430
they would have had to take dude it

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,680
hasn't been so long but you can't have

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,299
completely forgotten how to play for

22
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,849
example Bob you made it red right mark

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,950
has a red she has to draw of cards

24
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,599
because I challenged he does not

25
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,819
therefore I'll draw six there you go you

26
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,010
think I'm a lying motherfucker you're a

27
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,469
lying motherfucker I did it one because

28
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:33,959
I don't trust you two to show Bob how it

29
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,680
works at three because I don't trust you

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,299

31
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:45,720

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,470
