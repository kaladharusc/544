00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,900
Where I laugh at memes -

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,900
Or pretend that I'm not supposed to laugh at them.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
*skratta*

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If I had a tent around me,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I mean, literally, you could pee anywhere.

23

the memory is coming back to him

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,200
People saying this is messed up; you treat the dog wrong; don't criticize the dog, OK?

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
The dog didn't do anything here, criticize... (thinking)

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
(hmm what can I say that won't get me demonetized)

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,500

00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm joking of course, I hope-- I hope more than anything that this child is ok

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,260
I just realized, this would make a good, ehh, you know, Smash meme

48
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,200
Like, T-poi---pose kid.

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,020
Because, it's kind of charging up.

50
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,020
Maybe, Brad 1 or Brad 2 could edit that.

51
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,020
That'd be cool.

52
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,020
You know, like, tududududu.

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:14,760
BOOM, t-pose kid joins the battle.

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,860
but of course he's not gonna do that

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,620
*felix stutter*

56
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:29,880
if it's Brad editing it, he's gonna go, &quot;No'' black text

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,620
*chuckles*

58
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,360
and if Sive's gonna do it, he's gonna pull it off soo good.

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:43,620
Oh my God, I just know it.

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,320
or

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,980
third option: they call each other...

62
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,320
*laughs*

63
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,580
...and they both tell me to F- off

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,280
*phone rings*

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,480
*phone ring continues*

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,580
Brad : Yo, Sive, if you've got anything that you want to say to Felix

67
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,000
now's the time

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,580
Sive : Felix, F- off

69
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,280
Antman : Hello everyone in India

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
So awkward

75
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Hello my Indian fans, hope you are enjoying watching this 'You Laugh, You Lose'

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll get a lot of likes

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
*sticks out tongue* Yeah... ugheh!

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760

I wasn't on social media

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,320
Thank God, there was no social media before YouTube

94
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960

*song* (about Minecraft)

102
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,680
To be fair, though, that was an epic cypher

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,400
Narrator : Shark boy was completely alone

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,320
I never actually saw this movie

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,460
Narrator: almost completely...

106
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,820
Pewds: I feel like I need to see it.

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,800
Narrator: But one of the sharks recognised him

108

*shark sings*

109

120
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,000

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,800
why is 'Etika memes' everywhere? They're just everywhere

(Player describing the jumpscare)

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:13,200
&quot;Ambushed by a Chupacabra with a split second of a loud noise, and it made me jump in my seat like a 13 year old girl who just saw an overgrown, uncircumsized peepee for the first time&quot; (oh damn. Bad Chupacabra.)

194
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
PewDiePie chuckles to assert dominance 
(at the hilarious description that this player's giving)

195
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
&quot;I cannot believe I actually just jumped&quot;

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
&quot;at this Fear of Nightmares assfest&quot;

197
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,400
&quot;I've played so many horror games&quot;
(PewDiePie continues laughing)

198
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
&quot;Some of them, good. Some ACTUAL good horror games&quot;

199
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,300
&quot;But jumpscares have never&quot;

200
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
&quot;been an effective means of startling me&quot;

201
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,800
&quot;You can usually predict them......&quot;

202
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,000
(Cr1TiKaL goes on describing and PewDiePie goes on laughing)

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Fear of Nightmares, I need to play it

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,300
I mean he's basically explaining why Five Nights at Freddy's isn't so popular

205
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
it's not a fun game, well

206
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
for like a couple minutes, yeah

207
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
but once you get the gimmic of it

208
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,600
it's like... it's just jump scares made completely just to startle you as much as possible

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,100
the cheapest way to scare someone

210
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
and it's because it's so easy

211
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,900
but it's still so effective

212
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,400
Who's gonna come out ? 
Tasuketeee! (Japanese)

213

215
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,600
God damnit

216
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,900
that one was good

217
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,900

218
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
