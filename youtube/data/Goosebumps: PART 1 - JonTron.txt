epic attack of the jack-o'-lanterns

for a kid growing up in the 90s a Tales

51

55
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,579
writing and acting a scare and this show

56
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,430
is Hannibal goddamn Lecter alright just

man I am just blazing through these I

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,370
love how on the intro whatever the G

60
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,040
glides past becomes suddenly evil the

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,900
lady on the billboard goes from normal

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,760
to a slightly upset meth addict slash

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,340
Michael Jackson just cracks me up every

64
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,069
time how subtle the changes honestly a

65
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,599
lot of episodes of goosebumps are

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,250
downright entertaining and a pretty good

67
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,109
representation of the books I mean who

68
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,519
can forget the first time they watched

69
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,950
Haunted mask it still skeeves me out

70
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,329
just thinking about it good but

71
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,919
unfortunately for you that's not what

72
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,959
we're focusing on here today we're gonna

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,700
have a look at some of the absolute

74
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,230
worst that this show had to offer

75
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,049
starting off with don't go to sleep or

76
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,519
at least try not to cuz this episode wow

77
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,720
get that in there you got to do you got

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,419
to do like a taco some method so in this

79
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,400
episode we're met with madness family at

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
the dinner table treating each other

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,340
with the kind of respect you'd expect to

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,230
see from a middle-class American family

83
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,310
I don't because you're a midget you know

84
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,930
I could completely see the base to that

85
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,459
insult and your father left when you

86
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,169
were seven and I'm a single mom and

87
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,970
you've had a dark yet somehow relatable

88
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,430
past it seems like nothing can go right

89
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,989
for our hero Matt if you want to call

90
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,699
him that his siblings seemed to get

91
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,169
everything and he's stuck with the short

92
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,359
stick and he ain't shy let never will

93
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,470
know it mom

94
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,349

95
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,840

96
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,060
Attic no honey don't be ridiculous it's

97
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,010
out of the question that's not fair

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,360

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,639

102
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,960
frustrating but you won't be 12 forever

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,139
or will he I don't want to be 12 I hate

104

105

reality Matt so Matt goes up to the

112
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,520
attic anyways which is clearly what

113
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,099
every kid wants he gets scared by a

114
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,840
mannequin and lays right down on this

115
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,659

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,940
taking my meds

122
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,330
I'm not taking him so for a few moments

123
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,770
he gives himself the dick flashlight and

124
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,720
then for some reason the bed starts

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
spinning and sends him into an alternate

126
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,200
reality where he's the center of

127
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,480
attention can I use the phone someone

128
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,220

130
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,220
famous sports star and he just can't

131
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,470
seem to keep the attention off him

132
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,050
endorsed indoors what I thought what's

133
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,910

134

136
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,610
my mother's a single parent and all I

137
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,870
want out of life is to make it in the

138
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,370
big leagues like my hero check Robin see

139
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,530
strange fish nothing strange

140

who's speaking right now

141
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,770
that's reality so here we meet these two

142
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,360
vague characters who are spying on

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,680
mattis he's about to go to some

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,720
important hockey match but as he'll

145
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,040
remind you hey kid this is your fantasy

146
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,840
don't go around blaming the world for

147
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:43,460
your lack of sub fight we please give

148
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,580
that one one more time that's

149
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,670
magnificent it sounds like my old 1992

150
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:56,090
IBM computers starting up so this is

151
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,830
where things really start to get amazing

152
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,540
we got hockey coach man over here just

153
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,270
making oh just making a scene for

154
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:11,639
everyone to enjoy

155
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:20,730
you'll be sent down to the mothers

156
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,180
I feel like they gave this guy's

157
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,860
specific lines but he just said fuck it

158
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,090
and did whatever you wanted they're all

159
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,980
like guys lunch break I don't care just

160
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,540
leave it so after a while and that

161
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,249
getting the shit kicked out of him

162
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,599
he tries to explain that he is in fact

163
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,340
not a hockey player but get this a kid

164
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,569
because apparently those two features

165
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,699
are just not possible at the same time

166
00:07:50,699 --> 00:08:00,029
and he's finally met with Matt trice the

167
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,590
one from these big men and backlight

168
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,689
characters and runs through the hockey

169
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,460
goalie to an emergency unit operating

170
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,099
room what dr. Amsterdam there you are

171
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,479
doctor you're gonna have to take off

172
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,949
your hockey skates clearly there's

173
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,150
nothing strange about that it's true

174
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,529
you're a genius

175
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,120
now lady you know that's why you're

176
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,370
sitting right ready for surgery doctor

177
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,409
surgery Sykes

178
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:25,560
Lloyd as you can see the growth isn't a

179
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,839
particularly delicate area of the brain

180
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,360
now if the operation is successful the

181
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,029
president be perfectly fine but one

182
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,320
small slip this may be shitbag the whole

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,919
world is counting on you as you see the

184
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,690
safety procedures at this hospital are

185
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,029
pretty much to have match dr. Amsterdam

186
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,380
at this point Matt's getting pretty sick

187
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,790
of this undercover mary-kate and Ashley

188
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,410
bullshit he finds himself in yet another

189
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,199
alternate reality one in which he has to

190
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:57,360
defuse a bomb once again no one around

191
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,320
him seems to know what to do his

192
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,820
reaction is very appropriate if I'm

193
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,560
being honest this matter after death

194
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,579
moments away from getting blown to

195
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:15,900
shreds he still has time first joke

196
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,949
[Music]

197
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,680
so then he's at a wedding his wedding oh

198
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,149
this is making a whole lot of sense

199
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,579
finally he finds himself in some sort of

200
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:30,529
extra physical court where these two

201
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,300
guys at last reveal themselves as the

202
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:41,120
reality police question because at this

203
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,920
point I'm pretty sure that's about a

204
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,680
reasonable question all right let's just

205
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,149
stop for a minute and try to reason this

206
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,240
out all right so I'm here and here also

207
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,940
happens to be in let's call it trouble

208
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,670
alright so just run a few schematics on

209
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:09,670
that and yeah it's looking pretty good

210
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:23,110
please rise if the judge makes of

211
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,209
applause man this is a case even Johnnie

212
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,130
Cochran couldn't touch our

213
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,720
[Music]

214
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,880
for curiosity's sake of what crime is

215
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,530
this innocent kid suspected happy family

216
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,940
[Music]

217
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:54,280
reality let me get this straight

218
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,840
this kids crime is wanting to fight the

219
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,480
system even when it make me wrong as you

220
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,550
know accepting the status quo is

221
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,740
paramount in this contrast how do you

222
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,660
think we keep special interest groups

223
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:13,960
loving so efficiently think about it so

224
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,730
Matt goes home and never questions

225
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,130
anything ever again happily ever after

226
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,450
all except for the part where they still

227
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,680
decide to fuck with him for the rest of

228
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,980
his life fun's just beginning today

229
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,160
folks the moral of this story is never

230
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,800
think or else the secret police might

231
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,950
catch in kill you no matter what it's

232
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,390
good for the kids it's good for you know

233
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,850
I hate to stop the fun now but this

234
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,490
episode was just too big for one segment

235
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,070
we still have two more books to cover so

236
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,120
don't go too far

237
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,070
and don't worry part 2 will be out

238
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,170

239
