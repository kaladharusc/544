actually no first of all Bill Nye is

52
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,820
irreplaceable there's nothing like I

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,459
couldn't even pretend to be following in

54
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,880
his footsteps well I mean in a way you

55

let's ask the spirits what the hell does

102
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,140
he mean by event it's a ball of selenite

103
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,270
look at that what's selling I mean

104
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,220
selenite is a natural mineral on earth

105
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,919
that is fiber optic properties I want to

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,080
get a close-up of this you can't see

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,330
through it until you find the direction

108
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,700
and then BOOM it transmits the image

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,880
straight through to the top and this

110
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,770
isn't glass a lot of balls like this are

111
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,150
made of glass this one's actually a

112
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,800
mineral that's been smoothed out into a

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
huge sphere so that only happens on like

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,310
this particular angle yeah just through

115
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,660
that side and if I turn it 180 degrees

116
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,260
there's the other side

117

here you are Michael whoa I love this

121
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,710
nebula Spacey finish yeah I figured suit

122
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,420
your personality a little bit not just

123
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,490
warnings I have to bail out you just

124
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,920
jump right onto the couch you can feel

125
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,230
it yeah this is really uncomfortable

126
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,590
yeah it is really weird at the beginning

127
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,450
once you get it you feel so empowered

128
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,280
though this is about as fast as I'm

129
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,590
comfortable going well but that and now

130
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,540
there's a door and I already Stanley

131
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,210
leaned gently micro-movements back tilt

132
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,770
tilt back just slightly

133
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,020
I'm trying slightly now you're gonna

134
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,940
start going backwards yeah a bit yeah

135
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,680
that's perfect that's exactly what you

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,340
want to do and now if you wanted to turn

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,200
around there you got it too much

138
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,340
pressure oh oh yeah too much pressure it

139
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,780
does get easier every time though right

140
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,500
no

141
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:54,250
[Music]

142
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,680
yeah how does it feel

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,300
not really a being but a beam

144
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,960
restful a reservoir it's like you do a

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,259
thing and it becomes the paint that

146
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,819
others will use on the canvas of the

147
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,129
internet for their means you're never

148
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,490
quite in control of it which is sort of

149
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,199
in a way it's nice you don't have to

150
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,229
they kind of do the work for you just

151
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,970
sort of spread your message yeah whether

152
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,830
it be the I'm gay meme or anything like

153
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,460
that what is your message well and the

154
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,759
the message changes depending on the

155
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,860
other roughest part oh that was X Games

156
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,479
that was excellent

157
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,930
watch out there's a bar oh good oh hey

158
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,759
you saw my video about fixed points and

159
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,940
yet force of bloomin theorem so let me

160
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,430
ask you this who could you see I did hey

161
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,780
that's pretty good

162
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,180
yes I did and I but I wasn't certain

163
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,610
because at this point exactly

164
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,639
it's it's such a generic statement wait

165
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
a lot of people accidentally just say it

166
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,659
because they would normal the delivery

167
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,310
people weren't like syncing it up to

168
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,529
yours there's also not so obvious that

169
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,000
it was you know hey hey kids am i cool I

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,180
respect this guy's work it's inspiring

171
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,430
to me and it's enough one thing that I

172
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,520
saw many more recent videos was what the

173
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,440
heck yeah see whether for me it's it's

174
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,140
almost academic I'm fascinated by what

175
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,969
makes something cool what makes

176
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,729
something cease to be cool

177
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:41,060
was a bob with a meme and now it's so

178
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,959
not cool

179
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,079
but things come back like the way my

180
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,300
house is decorated is the opposite of

181
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,470
how my mom would have done it cuz her

182
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,690
grandparents use that kind of furniture

183
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,790
but since I didn't grow up around it I

184
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,560
feel like it allows me to be different

185
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,399
than my parents

186
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:05,570
so what is about to be cool again what

187
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,800
seems large quantity of nugget keeping

188
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:18,579
order can we get to 50 nuggets boxes

189
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,920
that's so that is a good price in Venice

190
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,899
I thought I was doing breaking the bank

191
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,579
but apparently not and I was like

192
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,680
actually ridiculously all those poor

193
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,899
chickens in lives aren't even worth more

194
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,510
than 25 bucks

195
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,610
the way Farm Street chickens thereby

196
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,490

203
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,850

five shapes are you tits man or an ass

206
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:08,389
man I asked myself that every day

207
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,370
I do a lot of puns that are just so

208
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,459
belabor that they're not even dad jokes

209
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,370
they're just like I have no life and all

210
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,949
I do is sit and think of bird games well

211
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,740
I've talked about this with a friend the

212
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,100
concept of dad jokes has sort of like

213
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,769
been twisted because now some more basic

214
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,230
people would say like if you if you say

215
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,180
a pun it's automatically considered a

216
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,360
dad joke not whereas a pun is a pun a

217
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
dad joke is a joke that a dad tells

218
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,889
predominantly because it's easy for kids

219
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,110
to get it it's not offensive it doesn't

220
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,120
require a lot of extra knowledge but

221
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,970
oftentimes it's very unwelcome to I find

222
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,769
that when I'm with my dad or friend's

223
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,829
dad they'll say to a cashier and

224
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,829
oftentimes the cashier says please leave

225
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:58,699
me alone now

226
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,350
