1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,080
movie not only spends 40 seconds lo

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,730
going but then tax on another almost 10

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,320
seconds repeating text versions of the

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,920
same things

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,480
why can't movies just movie already the

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,770
original title for this movie was

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,109
tonight he comes and with either titled

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,460
it sounds more like adult entertainment

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,910
than a mediocre superhero film

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,050
apparently before he was brick this kid

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,400
who should probably be at school or

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,599
something went around sarcastically

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
waking up superheroes waking up

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,070
superheroes do you ever get that

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,930
not-so-fresh Prince feeling cuz in this

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,340
movie Will Smith is a certified

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,360
douchebag movie has to establish that

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,129
Hancock doesn't give up he's avoiding

19
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,329
everything else that's been in his way

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,950
up to this point so why wouldn't he fly

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,629
over or under the interstate sign that

22
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,579
he could have easily avoided nothing

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,079
holds up better after 10 years then a

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,760
good old-fashioned Soulja Boy reference

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,859
also somehow I doubt this gang has ever

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,079
in any way cranked that your head it's

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,960
going up the drivers ass his head is

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,450
going up your ass your head is going up

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,020
my ass

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,530
Hancock centipede since everyone seems

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,970
to know who Hancock is one would assume

32
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,170
they also know what he can do

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,580
so why would they think shooting him

34
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,320
would result in anything other than them

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,369
getting their asses kicked

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,600
after all that shooting how would their

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,830
only be three bullet holes in the

38
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,420
sunglasses how are the sunglass lenses

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,530
even still there they should have been

40
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,939
blown to pieces after ricocheting off

41
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,430
Hancock's forehead they decide not to

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,110
speak English until now this guy clearly

43
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,490
flew up to their vehicle and rip their

44
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,369
freaking roof off over the angry police

45
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,840
lieutenant brings up a valid point what

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,250
does Hancock's motivation in doing this

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,720
he obviously doesn't care about much is

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,460
drunk off his ass most of the time and

49
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,170
is hated even when he does get involved

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,000
so why does even bother and what this

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,619
would say to the public is that your

52
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,960
company father topsis permit topsis did

53
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,250
they seriously name their company pharma

54
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,990
topsis rama topsis sounds more like a

55
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,670
disease itself rather than the company

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,200
that might cure it this Dunkin Donuts

57
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,520
product leasman is bad enough at face

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,110
value but it's even worse considering

59
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,000
this movie takes place in 2008 and LA

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,799
didn't know how to Dunkin until 2014

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,149
yes I'll see you in about 20 minutes

62
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,950
oh it's national how can you be such a

63
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,569
complete moron to be stopped on a train

64
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,250
track with alarms going off and a clear

65
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,840
line of sight and an oncoming train and

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,489
yet you somehow don't know day and

67
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,049
you're the grand marshal also unless

68
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,579
that train is completely automated he

69
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,049
just killed every single human in there

70
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,939
by stopping it that fast we call that

71
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,650
the complete inertia Ronin why didn't

72
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,090
you just go straight up in the air with

73
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,010
a car in honor of random spectator lady

74
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,840
who would be excellent cinemasins here

75
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,549
are four other ways hancock could have

76
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:34,049
easily superheroes this rescue better

77
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,790
considering he had time to knock on the

78
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,290
hood before doing anything flip the car

79
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,640
and just get out of the way to let the

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
train pass grab ray from the car throw

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,030
the car out of the way then catch it as

82
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,920
you let the train pass hold the car with

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,420
Ray over your head and step out of the

84
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,159
way as you let the train pass push Ray's

85
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,840
car and the cars in front of him out of

86
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,579
the way as you let the train pass you

87
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,670
saved my life this is my wife Mary you

88
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,019
find out later that these two are

89
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,489
inexorably drawn to each other

90
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,200
so how was Hancock not running to Mary

91
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,879
the whole time he's been in LA and why

92
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,079
hasn't she gotten ready to leave the

93
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,760
city at anytime after she found out

94
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,409
Hancock was there what are you doing

95
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,450
bullies take your right foot bring it

96
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,069
right up catch him in his little piss

97
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,799
pong make sure he can't use that thing

98
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,660
for nothing but a flap to keep the dust

99
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,400
out of his butt crap I did not teach

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,079
anatomy at superhero school does this

101
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,669
mean only men can have clean butt cracks

102
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,269
no breaks things Mary is extremely

103
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,799
casual during the conversation offering

104
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,690
a nonchalant warning to ray but stopping

105
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,340
short of what someone who's well aware

106
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,959
of the potential damage of ray working

107
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,760
with Hancock would do a 20 second

108
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
establishing shot for this RV who do you

109
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,060
think you are Danny Villeneuve the real

110
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,440
opportunity missed in this movie is that

111
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,180
we never get to see Hancock playing his

112
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,859
outdoor drum kit Hancock has superpowers

113
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,660
and virtually every part of his body but

114
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,290
even he can't avoid a vicious hangover

115
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,579
I know Michel is a dick and everything

116
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,109
but why the hell would he call Hancock

117
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,849
out for just landing and messing up the

118
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,230
street seems like this is just a cheap

119
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,209
excuse for Hancock to exact vengeance on

120
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,010
Aaron's behalf also the kids are the

121
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,449
only ones on the street so none of the

122
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,069
adults in the houses nearby I heard the

123
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,290
comet like landing one more time in

124
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,819
Michelle's defense I think this is just

125
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,850
how all French people greet Americans

126
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,980
seriously this kid survives this right

127
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,590
about this this is Walter the gray whale

128
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,989
everybody remembers nan buffering 2008

129
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,940
era HD YouTube I don't care how strong

130
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,560
you are unless Walter the whale already

131
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,489
had rigor mortis set in

132
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,170
there's no possible way to get a giant

133
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,150
whale airborne I it's extremely flexible

134
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,560
whale tail it's a simple matter of

135
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,420
weight ratios also whoever shot this

136
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,980
video has perfect zooming and tracking

137
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,930
skills it's not a crime to be an ass but

138
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,550
it's very counterproductive we beg to

139
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,030
differ

140
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,100
what springs to mind when you see this

141
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,860
homo homo in red Norwegian homo that's

142
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,100
norwegia homophobic law it's the law mr.

143
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,520
Hancock and you are not above it staff

144
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,160
and now this Nancy Grace position life

145
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,290
here can be difficult for me after all

146
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,090
I'm the only one of my kind I mean could

147
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,530
the movie foreshadow this obvious plot

148
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,540
twist any harder ok pine they don't like

149
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,860
him because he put them in prison but in

150
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,090
what universe does it make sense to

151
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,830
Hancock block in here since you know

152
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,080
he's a freakin superhero right so at

153
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,520
least one of these dickheads are dead

154
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,860
right did you shove a man's head up

155
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,170
another man's ass but apparently Hancock

156
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,910
faced no repercussions for this action I

157
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,200
know he's a superhero and this is an

158
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,240
unusual situation but can the movie at

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,010
least pretend to jail correctly why do

160
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,900
you always laugh picturing you looking

161
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,210
at the maritime movie has time for this

162
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,920
why is Ray constantly allowed to visit

163
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,810
Hancock it's not like he's his lawyer or

164
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,230
anything

165
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,240
he's a PR consultant

166
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,620
no ball thrown from that distance would

167
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,940
hit the rim and circle around it like

168
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,830
that that's a Miss also if it's this

169
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,120
accurate shouldn't that shock just go

170
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,690
straight through

171
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,280
why is discount dead shot even hitting

172
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,550
the rim in the first place yeah good

173
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,240
good Jeff the Sesame Street in goes on

174
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,190
for sometime Gail watch day five and

175
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,900
true to his word Hancock remains

176
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,480
incarcerated meanwhile crime is still on

177
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,400
the rise considering no criminal seems

178
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,380
to be intimidated by Hancock at all I'm

179
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,850
not sure how crime was ever down in the

180
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,360
first place

181
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,890
Mary is still acutely aware about the

182
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,600
danger of her being around Hancock but

183
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
goes out of her way to make this visit

184
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,990
to the jail this movie is rocky foring

185
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,610
in cars three it up all over the place

186
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,380
with these fucking montages and what

187
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,970
it's not doing is fucking hand cocking

188
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,100
so has there even been a trial scheduled

189
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,570
Hancock turned himself in but he hasn't

190
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,770
been sentenced or anything shouldn't he

191
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,240
be talking to an actual lawyer instead

192
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,510
of ray unless that ball was made of

193
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,800
flubber there is no way it bounces

194
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,030
further off the rim than it was thrown

195
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,830
live he has no idea how to physic sure

196
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,420
his fingernails might be super-strength

197
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,190
but considering his hair is also just

198
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,720
dead cells shouldn't it be just as

199
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:29,960
strong

200
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm just saying shaving with one's own

201
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,530
fingernail should relatively be the same

202
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,690
for him as it would be for anyone this

203
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,460
was already to this level of bad and how

204
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,020
did Hancock have time to shape where

205
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,340
these bank robbers always planning on a

206
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,780
standoff looks like they brought heavy

207
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,940
artillery massive cases of ammo and an

208
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,740
explosive vest for every hostage if you

209
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,060
have to read a u-haul for your bank

210
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,710
robbery you're doing it wrong brannad

211
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,450
Hancock is impervious to bullets but why

212
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,070
is his uniform we already saw that his

213
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,600
sunglasses could get shot up and his

214
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,160
clothes could burn if this standoff has

215
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,510
been going on a while how are there

216
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,070
still FBI agents running through the

217
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,450
line of fire shouldn't everyone either

218
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,780
be dead safe or pinned down by now just

219
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,700
pack up and leave man honestly Hancock

220
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,170
is taking so fucking long to save the

221
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,580
day that these assholes could be five

222
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,380
miles away before even gets to the bank

223
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,550
why does just one dude get the mask I

224
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,600
guess Hancock prefers to be a jump

225
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,190
scaring dick to the kidnappers instead

226
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,760
of you know saving the hostages

227
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,570
[Music]

228
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,470
seriously you were just shooting at

229
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,180
Hancock you know he's there how is this

230
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,950
confusing this is a spring-loaded

231
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,470
Deadman switch if my foam comes off it

232
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,780
boom how is this the best plan wouldn't

233
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,190
the hand release the switch once it was

234
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,960
chopped off considering he's so fast can

235
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,580
he just grab the guy's hand keep your

236
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,350
hand on that trigger this cop acts like

237
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,850
it's perfectly normal to be handed a

238
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,630
detached hamp

239
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,510
job

240
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,580
you good job this is where the movie

241
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,290
turns into every other goddamn superhero

242
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,940
story ever we don't want to see the good

243
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,470
guy Hancock because that's essentially

244
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,940
Superman we want to see him get drunk

245
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,650
and break we get it Peter this

246
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,510
rotational shot serves as the beginning

247
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,310
of Hancock's redemptive public arc but

248
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,560
could you stop the ride before I damn it

249
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,750
too late only thing I had my pocket was

250
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,380
bubble gum two movie tickets Boris

251
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,990
Karloff's Frankenstein the scene right

252
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,340
here is the reason that despite this

253
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,870
movie's flaws I wouldn't be mad at a

254
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,160
sequel these three are so good together

255
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,840
and Charlize is killing this performance

256
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,460
somehow subtle enough not to spoil the

257
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,960
twist and yet powerful enough to know

258
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
she's feeling something deeply 80 years

259
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,480
ago Oh

260
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,500
shouldn't ray at least have been able to

261
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,940
figure out Hancock has been around for

262
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,680
80 years and all his research he's not a

263
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,840
good PR guy I mean Hancock just had that

264
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
moment with Rett where they expressed

265
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,810
mutual admiration and respect and he

266
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,700
goes downstairs to immediately Mack on

267
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,330
his wife

268
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,710
I guess this proves the superpower of

269
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,820
boners is greater than the power of

270
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,330
friendship not that this isn't a

271
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,220
well-executed twist but it's such a big

272
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,660
twist it completely changes everything

273
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,860
about the film all of the sudden the

274
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,030
first hour doesn't seem to matter

275
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,470
considering that fridge has been out

276
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,610
since last night and you live in

277
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,390
Southern California

278
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,830
unless you're making Salmonella surprise

279
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,180
for breakfast you should probably just

280
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,470
leave those eggs alone this towel is

281
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,000
definitely not this towel

282
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,860
I mean continuity stuff is it my bread

283
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,210
and butter but how do you not use the

284
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,340
same towel in consecutive close-ups as

285
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,690
strong as he is isn't this a pretty

286
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,010
dangerous way to confirm his theory

287
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,570
depending on her powers this charlize

288
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,280
kebab could have ended very poorly okay

289
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,640
you go away you leave my family this is

290
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,900
really what Mary wanted why didn't she

291
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,280
have this bookin talk with him way back

292
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,600
when they first met yeah Mary's

293
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,920
flip-flopping on Hancock is the most

294
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,000
annoying part of this movie

295
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,220
my place is for Clark whatever let's not

296
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,870
exchange useful information like we're

297
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,460
Hancock's place is located we're gonna

298
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,740
go find Hancock and get your power back

299
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,270
Lou he really should have gone back to

300
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,560
the drawing board and figured out some

301
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
more interesting villains than these

302
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,370
three assholes how did no one see Mary

303
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,900
flying all the way from the suburbs to

304
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,480
Hancock's place so Mary's superhero

305
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
uniform is basically super smoky eye

306
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,890
shadow Wow

307
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,430
God's angels different cultures call us

308
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,050
by different names basically whatever

309
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,820
their work for asshole is what is this

310
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,380
not the popping popcorn isn't a cool

311
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,120
superpower or anything but why does he

312
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,560
have this many containers of Jiffy Pop

313
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,180
just sitting out on the counter for

314
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,280
brother and sister Wow sisters don't

315
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,900
kiss brothers the way you kissed me last

316
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,640
night first off the kiss last night

317
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,230
lasted for a fraction of a second which

318
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,000
would be exactly how sisters kiss

319
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,310
brothers also either did Mary even tell

320
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,630
him this lie in the first place

321
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,950
doesn't do anything to lessen his

322
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,810
curiosity and actually causes all the

323
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,010
bullshit that happens at the end of the

324
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,510
movie would it have been really worse to

325
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,680
say that they were previously married

326
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,020
stay away from me and my family you are

327
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,760
not gonna do this to me again

328
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,500
pretty sure Mary is out it at this point

329
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,420
so this threat rings a little hollow

330
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,010
call me crazy one more time so crazy for

331
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,840
Mary and asshole for Hancock did each

332
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,310
deity come pre-installed with their own

333
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,740
not safe word I'm sorry

334
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,480
well this relationship went from unknown

335
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,010
to traumatic quickly why have we been

336
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,750
spending over an hour on Hancock the PR

337
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,710
project when we could have been

338
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,570
exploring this so which is less

339
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,280
believable but they just happen to land

340
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,510
right next to Ray's building or that

341
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,100
they would be able to clearly see him

342
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,630
all the way up there this is very hard

343
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,400
to explain well then maybe you should

344
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
have started before the last twenty

345
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,250
minutes of the movie we're drawn to each

346
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,710
other no matter how far I run he's

347
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,930
always there he finds me it's physics

348
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,030
physics sounds more like metaphysics to

349
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,010
me or a legendary tale of old or plot

350
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,660
convenience yeah definitely that last

351
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,920
one you know what this movie could use

352
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,900
another huge game-changing plot twist

353
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,090
with just 15 minutes left also I know we

354
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,650
find out that his powers lessen because

355
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,480
of his proximity to goddess Theron but

356
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
even if it's somewhat progressive he

357
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,360
literally just crashed through a

358
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,010
building earlier that day how did that

359
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,110
not even injure him also also shouldn't

360
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,670
all his powers be affected I was able to

361
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,260
throw that guy across the room so easily

362
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,820
or zagnut missile that other guy's face

363
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,410
you would think after being a lot of all

364
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,610
these centuries Mary would have learned

365
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,720
to cook something other than spaghetti

366
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,060
and meatballs and becoming mortal it's

367
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,710
never happened before

368
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,750
and why is that exactly seriously the

369
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,250
end of this movie brings up way too many

370
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,450
questions that it doesn't have time to

371
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,880
answer every time we're together they

372
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,770
come after you through me Mary is now

373
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,180
been exposing for over three full

374
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,620
minutes and she still manages to play

375
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,210
the pronoun game so we don't know who

376
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,810
they are

377
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,340
since we know hook-hand was in the

378
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,870
elevator with these two earlier why

379
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,400
aren't he and his cronies already here

380
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,420
as well

381
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,850
policy of the cards keep pointing alive

382
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,630
you to protect this world so why didn't

383
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,710
one of the gods come down and let

384
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,330
Hancock know this so he wouldn't be

385
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,830
wandering around drunk for the last 80

386
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,630
years wondering what his purpose was yes

387
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,070
the TV mentioned earlier that these

388
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,810
prisoners escaped but are we supposed to

389
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,920
believe that all three of these guys

390
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,300
could just saunter up to the hospital

391
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,130
room of the one person the cops would

392
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,480
almost certainly know they were coming

393
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,810
after and he just casually back through

394
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,220
that wall setting aside the question of

395
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,510
if he's strong enough why would the

396
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,190
entire wall explode if he's just slowly

397
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,660
moving through it wait do they feel each

398
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,460
other's pain - not only did Mary Mary

399
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,200
quite exposition areum never mentioned

400
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,220
this in her five minute break down

401
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,450
earlier we've never seen anything

402
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,250
indicating this in any other previous

403
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,690
injuries has he just been standing

404
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,280
around that corner this entire time I'm

405
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,810
assuming every bad guy gets a handbook

406
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,280
detailing how long to wait in these

407
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,370
situations for maximum effect except for

408
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,660
the super-strength that ability to fly

409
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,640
but yeah other than that sure no

410
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,160
different they use acts machina this is

411
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,930
all build up for Hancock part two we're

412
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,030
airing after losing his mom and hero

413
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,740
turns to a life of heroin and male

414
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,270
prostitution eventually becoming a

415
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,260
serial killer the goal is to get away

416
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,030
from Mary so she can recover might I

417
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,830
suggest the stairs I hear there are

418
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,990
fewer buses also why does this even work

419
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,490
Mary was nowhere near Hancock when he

420
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,900
got shot at the plot convenience store

421
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
earlier so immediate proximity shouldn't

422
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,080
really be the key what about a tale of

423
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,750
the hunt completely cross eyed Queen

424
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,410
Elizabeth M Dean just because you've

425
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,910
been around a while it doesn't mean you

426
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,230
would have met every single famous

427
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,030
person unless you're the doctor or Bill

428
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,380
and Ted the original inspiration for

429
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,560
Ryan Johnson's salt planet is revealed

430
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,090
cool and eagle which we still don't know

431
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,830
the significance of or who's trying to

432
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,480
kill them or how the other pairs died

433
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,740
perhaps we could have answered some of

434
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,150
these questions instead of spending the

435
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,410
first hour of the movie worried about

436
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,120
drunk fresh prints

437
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,880
so the truth

438
00:13:49,880 --> 00:14:06,170
after all I'm the only one of my kind my

439
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,600
skull was fractured kouchtown population

440
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,410
you bro

441
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:21,170
call me crazy one more time come on good

442
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,449
huh come on do it

443
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:28,000
lay out right here do it do it
