hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic I

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,480
remember it so you don't have to my god

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,489
that was amazing even better than I

10
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,900
remember it I spared no expense

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,190
apologies but John Hammond is here to

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,660
convince us why there should be another

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,640
Jurassic Park see he just got done

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,379
showing us the first one I guess just as

15
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,330
spectacular as when I first saw it even

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,460
after all these years my god how did you

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,690
do it I'll show you now this is a

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,619
Jurassic Park movie no I am a Jurassic

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,660
Park movie but if we were to take just

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,890
one drop of the movies genius relax John

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,560
it's all part of the miracle of lazy

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:38,970
cloning no Jurassic Park movie by

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,770
creating the same thing over and over

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,899
with a drop of the original genius we

25
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,850
can have as many Jurassic park's as we

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,070
want remarkably remarkable the lack of

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,110
humility before great filmmaking that's

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,360
being displayed here staggers me Oh like

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,220
nah yeah I just want to relive my

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,080
nostalgia without questioning why I'm a

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,970
social media addict who does it like

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,150
change no no no let him talk I want to

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,680
hear everybody's viewpoint before i

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,630
automatically disagree with it I mean

35
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,429
don't you see the danger in what you're

36
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,380
doing here Jurassic Park is one of the

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,180
coolest most groundbreaking movies ever

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,280
made and you wield it like an alien vs.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,930
predator single I don't think you're

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,850
giving us sequels enough credit haven't

41
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,500
you notice each sequel is getting Dumber

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,080
with every clone I'm to that thick Park

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,220

multiplicity that's the one oh come on

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,350
each sequel has a ton of great scenes -

52
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,600
huh - great scenes that's what our

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,519
scientists figured out you only need two

54
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,410
great scenes to keep people coming back

55
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,959
lost world had the glass breaking and

56
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,790
the t-rex running in the city through

57
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,650
have the pterodactyls and the t-rex

58
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,140
fight and world had the opening and all

59
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,750
that ending but the t-rex I mean look at

60
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,310
the t-rex and then she's running around

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,439
in a high Hughes and then blue comes out

62
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,909
of now and before you know it the make

63
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,709
jumps after the water and then jump and

64
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,480
everybody's swap loading going goodness

65
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,409
gracious me

66
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,900
so by having only two good moments we

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,400
could have the same idiot characters

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
doing the same idiots things nobody

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,069
cares

70
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,750
stood on the shoulders of geniuses to

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,920
accomplish something as fast as you

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,359
could and before you even knew what you

73
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,760
had you patented it and package it and

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,590
slap down the plastic lunchbox and now

75
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,359
you're selling it you're selling it well

76
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,040
does anyone else feel weird that he's

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,200
getting the Ian Malcolm dialog cuz my

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,639
name is literally Malcolm how long is it

79
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,930
gonna take before doing the exact same

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,430
thing over and over it doesn't lead to

81
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,829
two great scenes anymore um I hate to

82
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,139
interrupt but what are your sequels

83
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:53,069
doing feeding round I knew it there two

84
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,420
bowing the original so now there's

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,980
nothing original left it's like the

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,170
terrible 90s would be with the awful CGI

87
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,840
deep rising though the relic lost us I

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,030
thought understand these shitty sequence

89
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,220
to make mommy happy you got so occupy I

90
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,449
think if you could you never bothered to

91
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,669
think if you shut it again literally

92
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,379
mouth I just don't know how this is

93
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:10,980
possible

94
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,329
well this is just like what happened

95
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:14,370
with today's movie Jurassic Park falling

96
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,049
obviously we all knew you were making

97
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,690
that comparison well do you know why

98
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,310
kids love the taste of cinnamon toast

99
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,849
crunch yes

100
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:32,520
will you tell us know

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,150
[Music]

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,500
it may have made a lot of money but

103
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,120
regressive world following Kingdom has

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,039
left a lot of viewers asking what the

105
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,259
heaping pile of dinosaur shit were they

106
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,479
thinking not only does it have little to

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,430
nothing new in it but the idiotic

108
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,500
decisions made in this movie are so

109
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,720
massive and so mind-blowing that you

110
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,400
feel like that one pilot and Return of

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,220
the Jedi too many of them along with

112
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,720
false advertising making it look like

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,490
the film was about the dinosaur is being

114
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,020
released on the public when it's really

115
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,849
just the last few minutes this duped

116
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,740
audiences pissed off critics and yet

117
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,240
still made a bundle at the box office

118
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,250
because dinosaurs are like dangling keys

119
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,349
to us just keep waving them in front of

120
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:10,880
our faces and we'll keep forgetting what

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,409
a lazy repetitive form of entertainment

122
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:15,650
they are so as long as there's still

123
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,539
people optimistic enough to have hope

124
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,430
for these movies oh God did those

125
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,229
sequels just belch up a hungover Jeff

126
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,020
Goldblum spared no expense we'll always

127
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,789
be here to review it let's take a look

128
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,880
at Jurassic world falling Kingdom the

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,979
film opens up with an inspiring idea

130
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,629
that no Jurassic Park film has ever

131
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,610
tackled before not just kidding it opens

132
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,050
with dinosaurs attacking people like

133
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,759
always

134
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,840
these guys are sneaking into the

135
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,639
now-closed park due to reconstruction

136
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,440
appealing tourists out of teeth as they

137
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,060
know this is a dangerous and illegal

138
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,159
mission so they smartly bring no weapons

139
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:53,960
at all

140
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,590
I don't know what this means what does

141
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,699
this mean

142
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,840
is this a gang sign are you in a gang

143
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,259
don't join the gang Hey look the t-rex

144
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,389
oh yeah it's not even really a big deal

145
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,340
anymore in the first one she always out

146
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,380
runs a jeep and the second one she can't

147
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,880
catch up to a crowd of people on this

148
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,169
one she can't catch up with Homer

149
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,300
Simpson's voice actor I'm a mother fan

150
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,960
who cares ok never laugh in a survival

151
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,030
film unless you want your obvious death

152
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,640
to be accompanied by

153
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,590
Boop quiet music shit's getting real in

154
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,060
this jurassic park

155
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,790
yeah we need epic latin gibberish to

156
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,590
frame the gigantic size of Jeff

157
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,740
Goldblum's ego I think we should allow

158
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,170
our glorious dinosaurs to be taken out

159
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,590
by the volcano as a dinosaur myself I

160
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,440
wish to be put out of my misery it looks

161
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,270
like a volcano is about to take out the

162
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,160
island of dinosaurs and the debate rages

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,440
whether or not it's ethical to save them

164
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,690
or let them die as well as the debate of

165
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,670
did Jeff Goldblum just read the script

166
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,650
and only now while saying the lines

167
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,780
realize how stupid it is I'm talking

168
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,570
about man-made cataclysmic change what

169
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,720
kind of change changes like death is

170
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,640
that really what I'm saying I'm a

171
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,200
scientist and that's what I'm saying

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,380
okay whatever dad meanwhile we cut to

173
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,110
the real heroes of this movie hipsters

174
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,940
oh you think I'm joking they have a

175
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,460
whole office of sjw's researching what

176
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,830
to be offended by next and good news you

177
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,080
have the whole movie with them as the

178
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,790
original owner of the park Claire played

179
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,560
again by Bryce Dallas Howard leads a

180
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,450
group of Chevy millennial ads to lobby

181
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,580
for the safety of the dinosaurs but they

182
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,320
get some bad news the committee has

183
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,960
result not to recommend any legislative

184
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,570
action regarding the D extinct creatures

185
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,700
on Isla Nublar they said this was

186
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,560
literally done just to shut Jeff

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Goldblum up so as you can imagine this

188
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,270
is a real big blow to Clair or the music

189
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,470
indicates things are good

190
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,680
who said this movie was tone-deaf she's

191
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,970
brought two John Hammond number two

192
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,920
that's honestly what he is did you know

193
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,470
John Hammond had a super close business

194
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,410
partner he never talked about in any of

195
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,090
the other movies and it for some reason

196
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,710
you're confused as shit by that don't

197
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,840
worry this incredibly forced exposition

198
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,180
ome totally natural human talk will

199
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,860
clear things up we actually met one

200
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,480
seven eight years ago and you don't

201
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,190
remember a Hammond a Lockwood well the

202
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,990
custom lab in the sub-basement why don't

203
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,520
you run his foundation since college

204
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,650
yeah extracted the first DNA from

205
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,090
right beneath our feet you wanted

206
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,340
someone young and idealistic to spend a

207
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,230
fortune John Alfred Hammond father of

208
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,670
Jurassic Park but of course you know

209
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,350
that oh my god did you really just spell

210
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,330
out who Jon Hamm it is like the audience

211
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,790
is that stupid John Alfred Hammond but

212
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,140
of course you know that this is a

213
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,940
dinosaur but you already knew that these

214
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,860
are teeth but you already knew that this

215
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,940
is paper paper we're just talking how

216
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,230
people normally talk hey normally talk

217
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,060
him his partner is Ben Lockwood played

218
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,170
by James Cromwell

219
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,090
my god babe pig in the city wasn't kind

220
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,800
to him John said it best

221
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,960
these creatures don't need our

222
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,350
protection they need our absence that's

223
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,180
why we're flying into a ttle fist major

224
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,000
once more yep he wants to save them and

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,010
bring them to a new island to live in

226
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,230
peace because all the other times we

227
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,580
ever interfere with these bitches it

228
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,540
always turned out great

229
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,910
there was a tracking system in place in

230
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,950
the park radio frequency ID chips in

231
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,550
each dinosaur

232
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,800
I remember I know we're establishing how

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,350
bad the rioting is there is one that

234
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,420
poses a real challenge for us blue is

235
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,430
potentially the second most intelligent

236
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,200
piece of life on this planet we honestly

237
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,160
should have let her write the screenplay

238
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,830
of course there's only one person who

239
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,300
can connect with blue and that's her

240
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,750
trainer

241
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,450
Owen played again by Chris Pratt I was

242
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,970
Groot that shouldn't be too tricky to

243
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,260
get him on board seeing how those two

244
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,370
were an item from the last movie Oh

245
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,350
ghostbusters doing this you know that

246
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,150
dumb shell where they break up a couple

247
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,010
for absolutely no reason except to get

248
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,470
them back again in the sequel cuz new

249
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,240
ideas are for people who want to think

250
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,640
if there's anything twister has taught

251
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,170
us is that a divorced couple that

252
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,090
constantly acts like a divorced couple

253
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,620
should clearly be together

254
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,280
I left you you're so stubborn well look

255
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,110
at you how you're saving the world yep

256
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,850
that's the line that deserve the super

257
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,530
over-the-top laughs look at you how

258
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,920
you're saving the world

259
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,170
if blue is alive you're just gonna let

260
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,559
her die well yeah I got a band I'm

261
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,149
starting anyway called mouse rat I

262
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,369
really think it's got take off meanwhile

263
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,959
at a countryside so cliched they

264
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,209
actually put in a shooting star make a

265
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:41,660
wish

266
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,089
maybe they'll clone samuel l.jackson we

267
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,829
see where the real romance in this movie

268
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:57,919
lies hmm mr. Owen blue guess it does

269
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,799
have a nice ring to it so he surprises

270
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,179
her on the plane heading towards the

271
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:05,299
island I think you were gonna ever show

272
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,819
up well I have to change a million

273
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,679
things to account for another person

274
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,869
supplies rations and so forth but thanks

275
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,160
for surprising the asshole

276
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,350
don't worry though our duo of

277
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,239
self-righteous Lisa Simpsons will bring

278
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,189
the last more likely die riding a horse

279
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:21,799
than in a plane no I'm not because I

280
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,329
won't get on a horse my chances are zero

281
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,249
this is just like when we got the

282
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,350
argument of who's green play represented

283
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,109
the evils of capitalism better meanwhile

284

back at Lockwood's house oh yeah I'm

285
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,720

and it's not just a fake out I don't

287
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,199

charming an actress you are honey you

294
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,639
will be the worst part of this movie you

295
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,230
have your mother's wicked sense of humor

296
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,549

297
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:08,989
notes to make sure I mean now what

298
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:13,839
strong genes ha ha ha

299
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,690
we're not playing the stuff there music

300
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,080
again it's a bug spray

301
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,380
Oh guys aren't gonna what bugs just

302

303
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,770

304
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:40,250

305
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,779
that did you get think he's afraid of

306
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,970
the t-rex we know we have to spell out a

307
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,970
lot for you so here it is again Oh she'd

308
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,279
be dead by now right

309
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:57,950
Oh frightfully witty they come across

310
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,990
the first whimsically beautiful dinosaur

311
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,820
a moment I'm just gonna guess and say

312
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,710
brontosaurus because that's always the

313
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,960
one they make whimsically beautiful it's

314
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,370
a weird thing your dinosaur movies show

315
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,440
very few kinds of dinosaurs we get a

316
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,660
load of this that's the first dinosaur

317
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,029
the dinosaur medic has ever seen

318
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,160
that's like a veterinarian never seeing

319
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,529
an animal why did you bring her yoga

320
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,360
should total money where there no other

321
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,820
dinosaur medics when this park was open

322
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,620
or did they just not have the badass

323
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,529
woke blogger spunk that she has things

324
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,110
could get hairy up these are powerful

325
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,790
sedatives one too many and she could

326
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,040
have respiratory failure also I'm not a

327
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,839
soft and witless is your comment implies

328
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,880
well at the risk of questioning the

329
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,310
towers of conventional cliche this movie

330
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,080
is breaking down I will ask the same

331
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,779
question I asked in van Helsing mmm

332
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,750
when does she get kidnapped fight the

333
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,150
good fight Wonder Woman they come across

334
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,950
the original car that fell with dr.

335
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,029
grant and Timmy in it

336
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,520
guess they moved the giant wall but

337
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,040
forgot the car as they locate blue but

338
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,709
open fire too early we leave son of a

339
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,220
bitch

340
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,660
cool so a dart they just said could

341
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,760
possibly kill a dinosaur just knocks out

342
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,279
Chris Pratt providing a comedic Lee

343
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,380
goofy moment when the volcano explodes

344
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,660
and he has to out numb his body to out

345
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:24,160
slither the lava what Chris Pratt

346
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,930
pretending to be mr. bean playing the

347
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,940
ground is literally lava supposed to be

348
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,330
funny

349
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,490
I believe being that close to actual

350
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,380
lava would probably leave you looking

351
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,490
like this throughout the rest of the

352
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,890
movie oh thank god these two are still

353
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,190
okay is this your ice - Clarence this is

354
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,930
your X are you sure that's notating

355
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,760
watch this down here good thing

356
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,860
instinctual dinosaurs are just as stupid

357
00:14:50,860 --> 00:15:03,700
about staying away from lava go up you

358
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:14,980
dumbass go up go up Scooby you're making

359
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,149
fun of what a coward you are

360
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:25,060
wow what a pussy movie can kill tons of

361
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,520
people but it can't say the S word the

362
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,959
cementing of the pg-13 genius continues

363
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,850
yeah that'll work

364
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,870
oh okay no I thought that only worked

365
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,100
with coke machines and Dennis Rodman

366
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,779
shows what I know no no I have to stand

367
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,819
still slowly back away and then just

368
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,980
there blankly at it rather than take a

369
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,350
millisecond to step inside they can't

370
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,079
track you if you act really stupid but

371
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,389
the t-rex makes her big entrance which

372
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:03,819
we already saw so it's not a big deal

373
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:10,779
but man they try to make it one you know

374
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,399
she really is a drama queen she's like

375
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,470
the ultimate photo bomber I could

376
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,149
totally see a post on her Instagram

377
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,360
being like oh my god guys I just happen

378
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,860
to be roaring for no reason when a

379
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,899
volcano totally erupted what are the

380
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,730
chances right like in follow I'll eat

381
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,970
you buddy we then get to the film's

382
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,800
credit the only good suspenseful scene

383
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,329
we're clear and Franklin almost drown

384
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,160
but maybe I love it because Claire

385
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,000
Franklin almost drowned Pratt gets the

386
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,649
mound and they see the dinosaurs are

387
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,740
being taken captive well too bad at such

388
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,269
a long distance away and they couldn't

389
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,829
possibly walk there so they walk there

390
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,149
in seconds and find the men are

391
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,860
kidnapping the dinosaurs for their own

392
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,949
terrible means continue to be late-night

393
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,689
these Disney villains and talk about how

394
00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:02,980

395
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,949
and be sure to take an Evo trophy to add

396

397
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,329

count

399
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,390
you're gonna feel that when you wake up

400
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,950
this will make a great necklace for my

401
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,070
woman suit our heroes goddamn jump from

402
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,930
an island on to the boat

403
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,540
while driving a truck and nobody seems

404
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,170
to notice

405
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,320
oh I cease because she wore a hat that

406
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,940
instantly disguises one of the most

407
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,650
famous faces the world had ever known

408
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,230
for a while oh isn't that the lady who

409
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,030
owned the park we were just sent to

410
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,310

413
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,580

414
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,230

415

transition they had in the first film

433
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,100
just think of it as kind of a big camp

434
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,010
it's a rollercoaster of emotion that's

435
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,360
not yet finished but you're writing

436

going on they're going to sell the

497
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,000
dinosaurs bring them in sure you

498
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,769
misunderstood I know what I had gone

499
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,919
crazy it's way past your bedtime you

500
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,600
were just like this the first time you

501
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,269
were this age our here must find Zia and

502
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,919
tried to help her fix up blue who was

503
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,960
injured luckily take over for Claire

504
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,990
oh my god is in my mouth

505
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,490
she says blue needs a blood transplant

506
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,320
and the only one that'll work is of

507
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,680
course from the t-rex okay I don't know

508
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,470
much about dinosaurs and judging by the

509
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,670
fact she's never seen one I don't think

510
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,410
she does either but he's getting the

511
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,690
blood from two very different animals

512
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,420
the same if a cat is injured with blood

513
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,370
from a lion work just as well

514
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,350
Chaplin what do you think oh the tea

515
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,970
rice of course wakes up they don't

516
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,280
realize they can just stay behind her to

517
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,030
be safe

518
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,980
and they attempt a crazy escape to get

519
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,690
the blood back meanwhile back at

520
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,140
Lockwood say I guess big surprises made

521
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,390
dr. Wu is helping them weaponize the

522
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,570
dinosaurs blues DNA will be part of the

523
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,760
next Indo Raptors makeup when did this

524
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,860
guy go from just the person next to the

525
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,440
dinosaur eggs to the world's biggest DNA

526
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,570
splicing supervillain I'll tell you

527
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,700
exactly when there's not that nod was up

528
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,510
to something

529
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,160
of course they figure out that Maisie

530
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,720
knows about their super illegal

531
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,990
diabolical plan so they give her a

532
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,680
timeout keep her in there

533
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,230
and keep the door locked now you think

534
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,850
about how weaponizing endangered species

535
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,880
can benefit you Hey look they like each

536
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,890
other again yeah seeing how their

537
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,420
chemistry made no sense it was out of

538
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,950
nowhere in the last movie I guess it

539
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,840
makes sense to do it once more but wait

540
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,280
this isn't moving starting to see

541
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,340
hipsters painfully forest rump joke take

542
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,590
your own damn samples

543
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:02,140
whoa whoa whoa I'm sorry Stephen Colbert

544
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,060

545
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,020
need to retire

546
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Jurassic world has won the battle of

547
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,840
political commentary and here everybody

548
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,400
thought fair nine eleven nine would be

549
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,130
the field to bring Trump down okay

550
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,470
nobody thought that but nevertheless

551
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,760
Jurassic world has beaten you to the

552
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,620
punch oh thank you so much writer of

553

dinosaurs to Lockwood's house somehow

556
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,990
not making any noise for Lockwood or his

557
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,970
servants to hear hey I guess if they

558
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,440
made this dinosaur dungeon and

559
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,180
auctioning house under his nose all this

560
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,740
time they must just have really quiet

561
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,600
workers and think of the dinosaurs in

562
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,040
their cages

563
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,670
[Music]

564
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,740
doesn't it be fatty wants to hunt

565
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,790
everybody who made this hates the first

566
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,550
movie but luck would finally finds out

567
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,320
hey I guess he does have a little bit of

568
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,410
a brain but not too much did you really

569
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,960
think you could get away with it pick up

570
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,660
that farmer I want you to call the

571
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,900
police oh hey Malcolm what are you up to

572
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,340
oh well I've spent years and years

573
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,870
building a quieren to auction off

574
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,670
weaponized killer whales I've hired a

575
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,170
lot of people to transport them and the

576
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,570
bidder should be amazing no no Malcolm

577
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,790
this won't do it all I need you to call

578
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,830
the police and turn yourself in well I

579
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,330
guess there's no other way around it

580
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,190
no not at all I'm sure once I let all my

581
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,600
accomplices know they'll gladly turn

582
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,580
themselves in - I think that goes

583
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,960
without saying thank you for setting me

584
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,070
straight and bringing my life to a

585
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,170
crashing halt absolutely it's the least

586
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,800
I could do

587
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,389
wait could I kill you

588
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:40,509
oh man I guess you're right okay I'm

589
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:41,769
placing the call right now spit-spot

590
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:44,950
hello police yeah I've got a whale of a

591
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,570
tale for you he's a good kid

592
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,039
so anyway the bad guy doesn't call the

593
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,809
cops and kills Lockwood meanwhile Owen

594
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,049
and Clara found out and captured who oh

595
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,589
you should have stayed on the island

596
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:01,509
grab him by the pussy man build a wall

597
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:02,950
to keep him locked up

598
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,349
so okay they're locked up in the house

599
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:07,059
the auction for the dinosaurs is about

600
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:07,570
to begin

601
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,459
surely this must be the opening of the

602
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:12,190
third act nope we're only at the halfway

603
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,729
point yeah there's still a ton of this

604
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:17,619
movie left Christ this film winning

605
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,359
faster if you just killed him instead of

606
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,159
explaining your plan like a James Bond

607
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:21,639
villain

608
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:23,469
I saved these animals you betrayed a

609
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:26,139
dying man for money Claire I admire your

610
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:32,229
idealism I never ever ironically uses

611
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:34,029
the trick that the Raptors used in the

612
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:35,769
Jurassic Park parody from The Critic

613
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,869
proving this pretty much is a parody of

614
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,849
a parody and even then it seems

615
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,950
pointless because she climbs out of a

616
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,619
window a moment later well why did you

617
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:45,820
just have her climb out her bedroom

618
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,279
window to save time no wonder we still

619
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,989
have an hour left stop writing pointless

620
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:52,269
shit dog

621
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:57,609
God Delia by the way there is a small

622
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,529
child climbing up your building you may

623
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,779
want to get that looked at so the

624
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:03,369
auction begins as all the world's most

625
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,469
darkly dressed supervillain leaders come

626
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:07,450
to bid on the flintstones garage sale

627
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,690
the ankylosaurus is a herbivorous and

628
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,879
quadruped ed this is one of the largest

629
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:13,750
are

630
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,870
dinosaurs the ankylosaurus is wearing

631
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,120
our Late Cretaceous fall look which

632
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,490
seems to say to on lookers I give

633
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,870
pointed conversation sassy

634
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,280
Owen has an idea though for how to get

635
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:36,340
out of their cell that thing's gonna

636
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,570
kill us totally gonna kill us

637
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,310
oh don't worry I'm sure there's yet

638
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,500
another cartoon dumbell scene that'll

639
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:50,020
save everybody they come across Maisie

640
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,330
and quickly earn each other's trust my

641
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,690
name is Claire what's yours

642
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,240
Maisie maybe you don't good Maisie

643
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,490
number two Lockwood and I always thought

644
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,740
as a we're middle name I mean well they

645
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,660
bring out the leftover Rex and tell them

646
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,370
it's not being bid on because it's only

647
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,460
a prototype then why are you showing it

648
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,130
are you trying to cement your place in

649
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,230
the ever-growing dinosaur auction market

650
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,090
I feel like you got the seal on this for

651
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,720
a while

652
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,910
20 million what do you want they bid on

653
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,620
it anyway which once again is a

654
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,720
pointless scene because Owen comes in to

655
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,610
stop again you could have cut that and

656
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,790
not miss shit

657
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,980
there's clearly blame on both sides for

658
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,750
this some of you are mighty fine people

659
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,630
of course dumbass goes into the cage of

660
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,880
gets the best thing to call it is coke

661
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
three asaurus two one else get a tooth

662
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,470
for his tooth collection

663
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,780
what follows is amazingly not the

664
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:52,390
stupidest thing in the movie she smiled

665
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:57,460
at the camera it's official we're in a

666
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,950
weird out video we are seconds away from

667
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:06,390
this thing just straight-up talking kids

668
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:17,140
what has one arm and is you know but

669
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,310
don't think on top of that you're not

670
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:29,800
giving a WoW moment - we used to make

671
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,440
real movies we then get the dumbest most

672
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,590
pointless twists in all the film and on

673
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,530
top of that it comes out of nowhere the

674
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,960
bad guys corner our heroes and floor no

675
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,180
reason just starts talking about this

676
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,210
you have no idea what she is Lockwood

677
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,600
never had a grandchild he just wanted

678
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,600
his daughter back he made her again mm

679
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,620
yeah that's pretty stupid right she's a

680
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,990
clone what's the point of that it

681
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,450
doesn't connect to anything and despite

682
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,360
being I guess a few clues nobody could

683
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,070
have guessed this because it doesn't tie

684
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,310
into any of the characters motivations

685
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,050
why even tell him that just shoot them

686
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,960
at acre in fact what tell me see that

687
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,120
what did he think was honestly gonna

688
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,610
happen after he let her know that's

689
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,930
right she's a clone now Maisie come here

690
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,220
good girl good girl yeah you were faced

691

694
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,570
clone right shoot them

695
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,519
Franklin saves Xia from the evil dr. Wu

696
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,499
God that still sounds weird and who

697
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:44,090
gives a shit Soros tries to hunt down

698
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,440
our heroes as the rest of the movie

699
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,999
pretty much just turns into Yoshi's

700
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:52,850
mansion boy does wipe a nice killing

701
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,080
machine is kind of a dumbass

702
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,820
she can't even find them when they're

703
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,740
literally under her nose and even when

704
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,779
she does she's so goddamn clumsy you'd

705
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,340
swear the scream killer gave her

706
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,169
stalking lessons oh yeah

707
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:07,610
you sure heightened sense of smell to

708
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,320
completely miss that they were right in

709
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,690
front of you a door oh well can't get

710
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,190
beyond that I guess she's the signs

711
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:19,159
aliens been great idea leave the two

712
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,049
larger meals who are trapped behind and

713
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,879
chase after the smaller morsel running

714
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,889
away what this thing is gonna have some

715
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,230
serious buyer's remorse

716
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,700
Claire's leg is busted up bad so she

717
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,220
urges Owen to go and save Maisie can't

718
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:39,390
leave you here remember I dumped you

719
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,750
the choir music comes back again totally

720
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,090
warranted for such a giant epic image

721
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:52,830
like Oh rapture and we see the kid who

722
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,260
figured out this giant evil conspiracy

723
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,580
boarded the bad guys at every turn and

724
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,590
even managed to outsmart a prehistoric

725
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,110
predator it's now the Cobbers for safety

726
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,150
it's one of the bugs of cloning they can

727
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,010
find ingenious escape routes along

728
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,530
dangerous ledges but think bedsheets are

729
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,350
indestructible bomb shelters but

730
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,549
honestly it's almost as bad as our bug

731
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,350
with cloning dinosaurs or even when they

732
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,390
find their prey they just slowly wave

733
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,860
their fingers in front of them rather

734
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,630
than attack like every other instance

735
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,669
what I'm trying to say is science is

736
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:26,280
stupid but oh it comes in two shooter

737
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,290
but it doesn't seem to work so he hay

738
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,660
goes to protect the kid B runs out the

739
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,730
door behind him C grabs the kid and

740
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,900
takes her with him through the door

741
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,059
behind him or D leans up against the

742
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,500
wall like a seven-year-old who's dumb

743
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,220
enough to hide under bed covers yeah I'm

744
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,330
convinced this whole thing is a

745
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,330
big-budget Johnny karate episode blue

746
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,400
comes in to save the day so now they can

747
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,650
go out the door or the window yeah

748
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,470
that's um okay it's not as safe as the

749
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,169
bedsheets but it'll have to do Claire

750
00:31:58,169 --> 00:31:59,880
somehow climbs the windows as well

751
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,190
despite having a busted leg a second ago

752
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,630
and distracts the soon to be forgotten

753
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,730
thesaurus long enough for Owens true

754
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,300
love to take her down

755
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,940
what's the matter feeling blue oh but it

756
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,860
looks like a toxic gas is going to kill

757
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,720
off what's left of the dinosaurs unless

758
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
they free them with that giant red

759
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,550
cartoony button Wow the designers really

760
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,240
took opening a door very seriously but

761
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,700
they decide not to as in one of the few

762
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,100
adult moments of the movie they realize

763
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,930
their love for animals it's not worth

764
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,240
the countless loss of human life the

765
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,640
mixing of two worlds damned I had to so

766
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,700
just close the door oh you only have a

767
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,700
big red button to open the door not a

768
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,880
big red button to close the door if only

769
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,460
there was a big red button for the big

770
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,530
red button who does I guess

771
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,480
and what's her dumbass reason for

772
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,510
dooming mankind their life

773
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,220
[Music]

774
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,170
they're about to kill a lot of little

775
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,140
kids like you too

776
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,200
dumbass so it's Dino spring break as

777
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,850
they're all set loose and the bad guy

778
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,500
gets his comeuppance from what used to

779
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,030
be the coolest character in the movies

780
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,620
but now it just feels like Porky Pig

781
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:27,179
ending a Looney tune short looks like

782
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:32,130
Blu has to part ways to tell that crazy

783
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,260
kid thanks whenever I eat up up a Girl

784
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,530
Scouts I'll always think of her so yeah

785
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,080
this movie ends with Dinosaurs getting

786
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,049
ready to eat a mankind would have kind

787
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,510
of been cool if this was the movie

788
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,580
it's almost as confusing is where the

789
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,410
hell did this one come from was she

790
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,600
captured in a sea tank it also opened up

791
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,460
with the door or did she literally swim

792
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,860
all the freaking way to a California

793
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,990
beach and what's even more confusing is

794
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,040
apparently we're supposed to have

795
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,260
sympathy for our adorable angel of death

796
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,000
but all I can think about is Malcolm

797
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,130
McDowell describing Michael Myers these

798
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,990
are the eyes of a psychopath but in the

799
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,359
end Jurassic world falling Kingdom pulls

800
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,889
it all together because of this

801
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:20,609
incredibly spelled out lesson which goes

802
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:22,590
against this incredibly spelled out

803
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,389
lesson these creatures were here before

804
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,980
us and if we're not careful they're

805
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,139
gonna be here after you which doesn't

806
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,000
really match up with this incredibly

807
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,040
spelled out lesson these creatures don't

808
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,290
need our protection they need our

809
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,750
absence but at least we can all agree

810
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,399
but soon they're gonna have to watch

811
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,359
them go extinct we're not if people like

812
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,760
you make a difference it's like when we

813
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,820
have a lot of messages that say opposite

814
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,740
things we're incredibly complex or

815
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,840
really transparent we couldn't decide on

816
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,310
what message we wanted this movie's

817
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,680
awful

818
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,540
I'll give credit that the effects are

819
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,100
pretty good much better than some of the

820
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,320
previous ones I also give credit that it

821
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,930
is kind of us so bad it's good kind of

822
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,000
flick I mean they just constantly throw

823
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,980
stupid shit after stupid shit at you

824
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,050
it's relentless of the amount of dumbest

825
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,090
bits of your face but that's not what

826
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,100
people wanted they wanted a real

827
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,710
Jurassic Park film one that's fun but

828
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,990
also made some semblance of sense and

829
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,210
gave us something new and different

830
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,730
instead we pretty much got the worst of

831
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,310
all the other Jurassic Park movies all

832
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,260
the weaknesses none of the strengths

833
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,940
everything that didn't work in those

834
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,850
past films is showcased in this one it's

835
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,070
stupid it's corny is pretentious and

836
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,030
it's preachy

837
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,620
even though half of the time it doesn't

838
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,750
know what it's preachy about I don't

839
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,730
care if it made money to me this is a

840
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:52,010
Jurassic flop now with the next genetic

841
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,980
Park sequel everything is correctable

842
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,130
John box office is a matter of sheer

843
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,440
will well it's still a flea circus it's

844
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,300
all an illusion when we have a

845
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,400
participative you never had a script

846
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,040
that's the illusion we were overwhelmed

847
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,110
by the first film but now all that

848
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,940
matters is not having another alien

849
