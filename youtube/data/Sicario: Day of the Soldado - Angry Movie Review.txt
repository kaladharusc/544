[Music]

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,379
hey guys we just got back from so bad

3
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,040
though they did away know Sicario day of

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,580
Savannah they have the soldier for those

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,669
of you who do not know me Spanish yes

6
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:32,410
and this one was written by I agree I

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,410
agree Harper said I'm really sad I don't

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,440
know I hated the ending and I felt that

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,379
it was completely unnecessary the

10
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,570
characters going through the motions and

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,420
it cheapened it the first one was so

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,079
good first one was so good and and yes

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,630
it doesn't and and I don't know why you

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,880
know so the first one is very McCobb

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,880
very dark very morose and very good

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,730
showing you the realities okay of the

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,409
situation and the sort of you know

18
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,229
circular you know nonsense of the way

19
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,630
the gears of government violence exactly

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,289
and this one kind of does the exact same

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,340
thing only worse with a worse story and

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,450
far more cliches put into it and I

23
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,810
didn't want to say that because I love

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,189
del Toro I love Josh oh yeah yeah

25
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,049
they're good yeah they're great but they

26
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,539
almost sometimes feel like characters of

27
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,119
themselves and just kind of going

28
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,469
through the motions I think one of the

29
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,319
major problems of the film at least for

30
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,689
me other than it feeling completely

31
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,509
unnecessary is I get it I get the world

32
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,279
I get what you're doing about his dart

33
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,049
it's not gonna end the way you want and

34
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,109
and all that kind of stuff but there was

35
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:04,240
no character that I could it's so emily

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,369
Blunt's obviously was really good in the

37
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,830
first because she was like this window

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,319
into this world and and the audience

39
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,420
seemed by the blog just idealist you

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,340
wanted she knew how things should be and

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,959
then they kind of showed her what the

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,909
real world was and it was horrifying you

43
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,280
got to live that like that feel

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,810
horrified with her

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,220
yeah but she's throwing up your it's

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,930
like oh my man I kinda want to throw up

47
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,520
too like there's some serious parts that

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,650
movie and this one you just didn't care

49
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,270
you didn't give a because you don't

50
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,010
have a character like her

51
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,290
this one revolves the plot or all I'm

52
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,670
not gonna spoil anything we'll save that

53
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,160
for the spoiler section but it revolves

54
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,890
around you know the Mexican cartels

55
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,590
again and the daughter of a Mexican

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,780
cartel character and you just don't get

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,340
anything from her or from Del Toro's

58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,570
character who ends up as her companion

59
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,300
throughout most of the film and I just

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,850
don't really buy some of the motivations

61
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,519
behind this kind of thing and it really

62
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,420
just kind of meanders and goes nowhere

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,959
and then cuts off with a horrible ending

64
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,390
that is more concerned about setting up

65
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,620
a sequel and another one it feels cheap

66
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,050
it cheapens these characters it cheapens

67
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,569
the franchise when I felt the first one

68
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,549
was so strong we probably didn't need

69
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,950
another one like I think oh I don't know

70
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,140
I didn't know it was a book series yeah

71
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,579
is it a book series I know I just think

72
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,650
it was written I don't want a trilogy

73
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,900
okay well then in that case he's trying

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,060
to set up and he's doing his best a

75
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,910
sequel bait and let me tell you this one

76
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,000
is just as pointless feeling as Jurassic

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,480
Park fallen Kingdom oh you know what I

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,329
mean it kind of sets up oh here's what

79
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,790
the next one might do this one kind of

80
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,709
does that but I don't even want to see

81
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,430
the next one but it's trying to set up

82
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,380
whereas in fallen Kingdom you're like oh

83
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,500
my god I let you know that that might be

84
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,510
an interesting time summer would be cool

85
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,070
but I don't want to see any more

86
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,890
pointless murders in this third of is

87
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,840
exactly so whereas I was super excited

88
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,539
going into since the second sequel

89
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,970
because I thought it was he is yeah did

90
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,340
you see John run tomatoes no I didn't

91
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,810
know the the score was like 91 I think

92
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,569
when I looked at it I was like

93
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:33,189
I love the first one the high meters are

94
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,740
like 97 people want to see this but now

95
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,649
it's at 65 okay and this is one of those

96
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,259
rare cases that the you know the our

97
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,050
t-score is actually kind of reflective

98
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,300
of once you go in and then when you come

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,249
out cuz the lid the score literally fell

100
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:50,499
when we came out we went in and then we

101
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,659
came out and we felt the same way

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,599
very disappointing very pointless and

103
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,849
what would you feel about it Joe what

104
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,349
about like well going into it like I

105
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,419
read this summary of it it was basically

106
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,839
like the US border in the Mexican border

107
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,490
that the drug cartel and now they're

108
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,270
doing terrorism involved oh yeah I was

109
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,080
worried one minute it was like okay so

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,559
it's not what I expected at all right no

111
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,419
really no terrorism at all yeah exactly

112
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,490
so they set up this grid this subplot

113
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,229
where it makes you roll your eyes are

114
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,209
like oh god great yeah yeah are they

115
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,369
going with through the Border Patrol

116
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,339
they show oh no Muslims are coming

117
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,439
across the border now and then the

118
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,899
camera zooms in on their prey or carpets

119
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,240
and they play the most ominous

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,399
music as they're staring at just normal

121
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,669
prayer carpets that's what they use in

122
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,889
the normally please oh no the Muslim God

123
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,769
and but exactly after that they

124
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:53,919
completely drop that storyline yeah and

125
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,879
essentially kind of do the first film

126
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,490
but just worse for support this time

127
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,769
he's like remember our first job this

128
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:06,909
time no rules what rules were in the

129
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,129
first one and then in said because I

130
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,619
think the writing had a little bit of

131
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,209
problems because he was like we're

132
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,189
setting you loose no rules and he goes

133
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,439
what kind of what about rules

134
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,659
yeah do you remember that part what did

135
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,789
something like that it was like I just

136
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,669
said no rules why are you asking me what

137
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,180
you can and can't do there are no rules

138
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,159
so Josh Brolin's character was talking

139
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,709
he was it was good so so I think just

140
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,409
happening and Alex is tapping into how

141
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,719
many cliches are on this film the first

142
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,969
Sicario didn't have any of that

143
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,050
if that were you listing

144
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,500
it felt like it subvert of your

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,419
expectations many times and here it is

146
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,039
following tropes it feels like it's

147
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,629
completely written by a different person

148
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,569
in my opinion you and will talk about

149
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,280
more of the stupid things that

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,430
characters do that I can't stand I must

151
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,050
say it but I will say any spoilers so

152
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,509
there's there's these politics and it

153
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,300
just you know it gets things real messy

154
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,889
and I understand the message because

155
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,050
that's kind of how the first one was but

156
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,530
this one you know it's a few levels

157
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,990
above like it involves the president and

158
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,840
stuff like that and you're like hmm you

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,909
know a suspension of disbelief here is

160
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,240
is really being stressed by the film

161
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,419
with those cliches and ridiculous

162
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,419
coincidences the just kept happening and

163
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,789
it was it was plot conveniences yeah

164
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,780
it's like alright we wrote ourselves

165
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,550
into a corner what we do oh I know we'll

166
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,050
do this thing and it's like one in a

167
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,400
million chance and then it's another one

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,900
in a million chance and let's just hope

169
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,699
that that continues to happen and the

170
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,610
audience bought it but it's a damn shame

171
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,449
because you know the film while the

172
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,370
first film had that realistic feel

173
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,949
realistic of cinematography this one

174
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,050
carried that same thing right it's just

175
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,569
did you enjoy this the cinematography

176
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,830
and I did yeah I and there was one

177
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,990
really great action scene I'll give it

178
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,740
bad

179
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,340
I love these sort of convoys you know

180
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,120
you know reminds me of this is the the

181
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,199
inverse of this convoy scene and

182
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
Harrison Ford's film you know because

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,860
it's very claustrophobic member those

184
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,840
dudes it's one of the most famous I

185
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,550
think clear and present danger you know

186
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,650
it's probably a different one no muscles

187
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,779
anyways they have they have a convoy

188
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,789
seen here in the middle of a desert and

189
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,589
you know my god now we'll see everything

190
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,539
coming I

191
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,849
I got this and and I really enjoyed that

192
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,139
scene it was really good if it make

193
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,759
sense but yeah I enjoyed it yeah I

194
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,800
didn't right it made perfect sense they

195
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,899
have a droll sense thousands of feet up

196
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,880
in the air of scouting the entire area

197
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,930
and all of a sudden a bunch of trucks

198
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,069
show they spotted it and they said

199
00:08:54,069 --> 00:09:01,569
they're on their way and gunned down a

200
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,079
bad guy showed up and despite having 15

201
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,550
million dollars and there was a great

202
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,779
action scene and you guys have probably

203
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,009
seen this in the trailer because

204
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,050
unfortunately I hurt I haven't seen the

205
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,089
trailer but I heard there showed a lot

206
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,740
in the trailer and and I'm I'm kind of

207
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,940
making an estimate that they showed too

208
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,130
much in the trailer because there's

209
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,949
really not much here and so I'm thinking

210
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,930
that if there's not much here then then

211
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,009
they probably showed it off in the

212
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,380
trailer so unfortunately a film that

213
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,990
pales in comparison to its predecessor

214
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,120
in almost every single way it's not as

215
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,730
bad as we've been real hard on it

216
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,860
so I don't think this is a horrible film

217
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,470
I wouldn't even consider this bad no

218
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,569
ma'am but you're right it sounded made

219
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:47,889
like if you just want listening to what

220
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:49,149
we're saying it's like this is like a 1

221
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,680
or 2 it's like it's not that bad but

222
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
when you're comparing it to something

223
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,649
that was truly great and unexpected yeah

224
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,199
and our hopes were high and you see this

225
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,850
it's it's understandable that we don't

226
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,899
like it all that much yeah it's got good

227
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,880
performances from the people you think

228
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,589
is going to put in good performance good

229
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,459
performances great realistic action that

230
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:16,769
is tension failed and well filmed and

231
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,399
but the dialogue has some problems

232
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,889
mainly due to the script the story and

233
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,899
the cliches one after another the

234
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,310
coincidences and the you know tropes so

235
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,290
that's what brings down Safari of the

236
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,689
decisions that characters are told to

237
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:39,670
make it's it's time to give it a final

238
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,980
verdict so we'll start with Alex what

239
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,790
would you give Sekar er yeah Sicario day

240
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,190
of Soldado

241
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,690
this is like this feels kind of average

242
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,910
ish also if I if I try to separate it

243
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,399
from the original and if this was on

244
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,089
Netflix

245
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,709
well did you wash it out of the blue

246
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,079
what would I give this if I just watched

247
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,260
some crappy easily digestable action II

248
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,730
movie like a because this is more

249
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,440
suspense and thrilling it's not it's not

250
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,450
about the explosions and this feels kind

251
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,310
of fairly if this is like a Netflix v

252
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,800
like this is it's an average film that's

253
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,570
got some good scenes it's got some good

254
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,970
acting I mean they did some stuff to

255
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,440
Benicio the tour on this movie that were

256
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,570
great and I just like I'll remember

257
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,640
those things for a while this doesn't

258
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,570
feel it's no it's not it's not

259
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,850
satisfying and not satisfying in a

260
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,079
Hollywood way but it's not even

261
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,660
satisfying in the original ways in fact

262
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,060
this feels so separated from the

263
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,490
original that these could be completely

264
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,589
different characters and have zero

265
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,829
connection to the first film and and and

266
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,140
in many ways it's kind of its kind of

267
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,990
like that and this is just peeking into

268
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,540
that world in its most boring story

269
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,800
aside from one convoy action scene yeah

270
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,470
I'm not joking this is and since we've

271
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,910
already been in this world we've already

272
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,579
been exposed to the hypocrisy and there

273
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,730
was the dark darkness of it this is this

274
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,800
is just more of it in a bad way without

275
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,500
a message to tell without a really good

276
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,060
story to give you well what would you

277
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,709
give it Joe would improve for me yeah we

278
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,540
continue the story with the fight with

279
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,970
the drug cartel and yeah we never saw

280
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,860
this making of revenge plot

281
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,500
Venetia notorious character and goes and

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,680
kills which name Carlos Reyes yeah yeah

283
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,410
they have amazing shootout we did that I

284
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,540
wanted to see that kind and and yes we

285
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,699
never ever once see a single cartel head

286
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,010
or boss oh well that's common in the

287
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,329
third one like I think that's what the

288
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,949
third one's just trying to say I think

289
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:50,640
so filler I I did not like the ending of

290
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,740
it to this yeah I still like the

291
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,550
performances and everything for this I'm

292
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,350
gonna have to go with

293
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,750
this is you seek me above average yeah

294
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,029
average if you like just try the house

295
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,470
it's a good watch yeah yeah I agree with

296
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,250
that a lot

297
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,980
I was I was wavering between a six and a

298
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,810
five because I do think it does have

299
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,610
some above-average elements the way it's

300
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,189
filmed the way it's told the soundtrack

301
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,550
it all gets you in that Sicario mood and

302
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,750
world it's just a disappointing average

303
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,410
at best storyline with so many cliches

304
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,019
and and so many tropes and problems that

305
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,620
the first film didn't have it feels like

306
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,810
creatively he stretched it it could have

307
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,360
been if he really does want that third

308
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,879
film I bet you by the end if we watch

309
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,740
all three two films would have done the

310
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,810
job like you're saying at the beginning

311
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,579
he starts going one way and completely

312
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:57,160
just stops it kind of drags we started

313
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,379
to get our checks went at a point in the

314
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,529
movie we're like the movie was still way

315
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,930
far from being resolved and I knew that

316
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,899
was a bad sign I was like Joe is it

317
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,689
about to be over and then at the end

318
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:16,839
yeah the beginning had nothing inning I

319
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,129
thought we were seeing I mean you touch

320
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,110
on a little bit this was a completely

321
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,970
unrelated movie like it starts inside

322
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,139
movie are we saying exactly so I'm gonna

323
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,759
so like I said I was wavering between

324
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,610
six and five and I want to give it a 6

325
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,040
but to be fair and our ratings are

326
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,370
actually contextual to to certain things

327
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,319
and if I compare this most of the

328
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,870
original I think it's a 5 out of 10 if

329
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,790
you're coming in it you know blind and

330
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,379
you've never seen the first one and you

331
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,879
just wanted sort of something about

332
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,730
maybe the Mexican cartels but if you

333
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,230
were looking for just some interesting

334
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,259
black ops stuff then yeah I can see you

335
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,360
you know even then you're gonna end up

336
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,670
at a six you know maybe a little higher

337
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,399
than that but are probably lower so but

338
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,779
what I'm saying but compared to the

339
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,939
first one I think it's a 5 out of 10 I

340
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,670
feel like my time was wasted I feel like

341
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,040
the ending was wholly unsatisfactory and

342
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,840
not in they're always not a

343
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,640
would ending but this one is clearly

344
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,410
just trying to set up that third film

345
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,240
and I didn't appreciate it because I

346
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,910
didn't get a satisfying resolution to

347
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,150
this one so yeah five out of ten

348
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,340
I would save your money I really wanted

349
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,680
to recommend this film over you know say

350
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,930
Jurassic Park fallen Kingdom drew but

351
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,620
here's the thing

352
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,320
I would rather you watch I would rather

353
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,960
you watch Jurassic Park qualen Kingdom

354
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,720
no fun of it no I make the thought of it

355
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,870
with though at how dumb and stupid that

356
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,150
film is because you can't really make

357
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,190
fun of this one it just ends and you're

358
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,830
like oh no it could have been a lot

359
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,590
better yeah hey you know what I mean so

360
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,510
that's why you know in comparison to

361
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,000
such a high mark of Sicario this one

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,770
fails alright guys a little long on the

363
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,920
review but we we like the first one so

364
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,480
much we wanted to really get a lot of

365
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,320
our our opinions out on this one so if

366
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,700
you want to stick around for spoilers

367
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,320
will kind of give you the plot shouldn't

368
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
take more ten minutes cuz the flat so

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,710
simple and thank you very much for

370
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,480
watching we'll see you guys on the next

371
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:28,600
egg rejoice show hi guys

372
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,880
hey guys welcome to the spoiler section

373
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,060
so essentially what the plot line that

374
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,700
we couldn't really talk about is the

375
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,660
America the no defense secretary with

376
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,430
permission from the president wanted to

377
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,410
start a war between the cartels because

378
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,680
Muslims somewhat the cartels had shipped

379
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,160
in one terrorists yeah I'm the captain

380
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,560
now and then the captain the pirate

381
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,380
captains who controlled the Somalia

382
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,990
control all the ships in that area were

383
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,840
paid by the Mexican cartel to let the

384
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,390
ship through that had the migrants on

385
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,910
there that came in with the bombs that

386
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,950
went into target just one came from

387
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,480
there the other the ones that blew up

388
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,250
the target were from New Jersey yes

389
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,290
aha see that's why we got confused in

390
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,180
the plotline got dropped because it was

391
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,540
like a reactionary politics we are our

392
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,430
minds and hearts are with you and now

393
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,730
we're gonna get them you know but but

394
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,400
then but then America never knows what

395
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,190
they do but yet behind closed doors we

396
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,810
go on this black op mission it's like

397
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,810
all right Mexico's cartels we're

398
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,880
gonna go in and and we don't give a

399
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,230
about the Mexican government or the

400
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,570
police or nothing let's start a war and

401
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,430
this all has to be hush-hush will kill

402
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,020
via this cartels attorney and will

403
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,760
kidnap that cartels daughter and then

404
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,380
it'll be really this sweet thing and

405
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,420
then it falls apart cuz I'm gonna get

406
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,240
Brolin who does you know he'll do all

407
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,860
the do you want me to get dirty

408
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,990
okay dirty you know that kind of thing

409
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,550
yeah exactly what he says and then of

410
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,290
course he's got his buddy who he works

411
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,080
with on these missions these who is his

412
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,800
Sicario and he's a hitman yeah so and he

413
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,720
knows the the the ropes and everything

414
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,870
and so they basically kidnapped one of

415
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,060
the most powerful drug cartels daughter

416
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,000
he can make it's the rival gang and then

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,830
it turns out that the police are on the

418
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,730
payroll of the cartels who wouldn't know

419
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,950
so they turn their guns on the convoy

420
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,550
but man those are some really strong ass

421
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,010
 bulletproof windows that it's

422
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,800
gonna stop a 50 Cal let that rain I

423
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,960
don't think so but whatever okay that's

424
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,580
what got you in this movie yeah whatever

425
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,770
no but I was like cuz I was like there's

426
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,260
no way that I was like these police

427
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,760
cannot betray them because that

428
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,650
calendars way too big for that book but

429
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,810
I guess they I guess hey I'm behind on

430
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,310
military tech so so that's when this gun

431
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,110
battle happens and they turn on the

432
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,160
federales and basically have a gun

433
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,520
battle in a new in Mexico or in America

434
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,350
okay Mexico doesn't matter but this is

435
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,600
gonna create this big political problem

436
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,820
and all these police officers are dead

437
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,650
and then people have to answer for it so

438
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,750
the president gets cold feet and says no

439
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,730
call this off I don't want to start a

440
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,650
war anymore even though I've already

441
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,330
pulled the trigger and we've already

442
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,160
kidnapped the girl we've already done

443
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,530
this kill the other dude makes no

444
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,920
 sense and so then what what does

445
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,020
that do unfortunately the little girl

446
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,180
does the stupidest things she

447
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,820
can do well there's gunfire and 50

448
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,860
caliber bullets being fired everywhere

449
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,090
she leaves the armored car and just

450
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,340
walks off into the desert so of course

451
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,590
you know Benicio del Toro has to go

452
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,080
after her and once they shut down the OP

453
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,490
he is betrayed and they the secretarial

454
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,260
e doesn't make any goddamn sense right

455
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,110
so this the the handler Katherine

456
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,670
Kinnear comes in and says you have to

457
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,130
kill the girl and kill Benicio del Toro

458
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,660
but they're gonna let all of the other

459
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,060
operatives live and so why do we have to

460
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,340
kill that guy like he he's part of this

461
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,660
thing too and they've always been

462
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,730
working together he is an outsider that

463
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,770
Josh Brolin's character Josh Brolin's an

464
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,000
outsider too he's not a member of them

465
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,640
no no he is he is the one that assembles

466
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,020
his team that's what they say you have

467
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,840
the power to get by whatever you want so

468
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,520
he goes to the the shady guy who is

469
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,960
usually a comedian I forgot what that

470
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,540
guy's name is and then he gives them

471
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,580
Black Hawk helicopters all sorts of

472
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,190
stuff and works with his own team that

473
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,190
he wants but yeah it's just

474
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,660
so many tropes yeah what is give me a

475
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,500
coincidence

476
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,630
so the they're leaving they're driving

477
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,880
away from a mall in McAllen and this

478
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,590
little kid who ends up being a coyote

479
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,690
Joe was like hey it says McAllen Joe was

480
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,990
born in McAllen and they were like what

481
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,350
did I see this did they show the Mexico

482
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,600
and then the camera moved over and it

483
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,380
was okay so in that case but I didn't

484
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,660
know is that closed yeah cuz the

485
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,760
cameras like look boom and it's right

486
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,410
across the street but ya know we know

487
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,840
it's close but I guess the point is no

488
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,010
it doesn't have to be right at the

489
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,340
border it's just these are where the

490
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,130
woody colored camels and coyotes not

491
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,700
camels these are where the Coyotes

492
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,380
transport people across the border and

493
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,170
he's getting his little cousin to join

494
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,840
so you've got these two storylines kasha

495
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,550
strip talked about this and we review we

496
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,010
always forget something is uh well I

497
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,780
don't want to so like that was a big

498
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,980
thing I wanted to talk about it in the

499
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,220
review but so we have this case you know

500
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,420
that they're completely unrelated and

501
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,590
you know they're gonna intersect

502
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,780
eventually and the stupidest thing that

503
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,100
happens is there's fifteen year old kids

504
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,360
walking through a parking lot of a mall

505
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,540
and the the Josh Brolin Benicio del Toro

506
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,880
and this other dude almost hit him with

507
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,440
a car and then he like punches the hood

508
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,930
and then because I'm tough because I'm

509
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,600
15 and they they turn on the sirens and

510
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,890
then you rarely get immediately

511
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,440
memorizes their faces yeah and then you

512
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,970
do know that that's gonna be the

513
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,380
intersection so immediately you're like

514
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,930
this stupid coincidence is gonna happen

515
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,580
and then they set it up super poorly

516
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,560
with a kid at night through a dirty

517
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,990
window staring at a light source with a

518
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,820
huge happy video some tour has a huge

519
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,070
hat on because he's actually trade so he

520
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,440
wants to get the daughter character

521
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,510
across the border back into the United

522
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,340
States even though that's exactly where

523
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,330
they're gonna kill her

524
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,220
well he doesn't know that's it maybe he

525
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,230
does it doesn't make any sense anyway

526
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,890
but he recognizes recognized

527
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,720
I know it's so stupid why are you going

528
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,190
back to the US where they're waiting for

529
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,190
you black ops II kid oh well so

530
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,770
again because he was these seconds she'd

531
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,910
be safer way say

532
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,710
in Mexico but yet he takes her to the

533
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,720
place that she is unsafe even though

534
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,250
they called him on the phone and said we

535
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,260
need to kill the girl and he's like I

536
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,030
can't do that it's like well you got to

537
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,050
do what you got to do

538
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,020
all right I'll see you soon now bring it

539
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,360
to America anyway I didn't say that part

540
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,590
but that's what he does

541
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,630
yeah but he grew it's the Hitmen that

542
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,160
has a heart of gold because there was to

543
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,800
Josh Brolin did it and Benicio Natur did

544
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,720
it I hated both times it happens so this

545
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,910
is the film where they grew their hearts

546
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,160
grew three times and broke the little

547
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,730
stethoscope and and so towards the end

548
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,990
of the film Benicio del Toro is

549
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,940
recognized caught and that little 15

550
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,920
year old boy that recognized him shoots

551
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,970
him in the head

552
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,400
wellhere's and I was like holy

553
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,820
 like I hate this film but I

554
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,830
was gonna try to be okay with it because

555
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,900
the brutality of these kind of things

556
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,610
like hey man even the most badass

557
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,150
 hit man died in shitty ways so I

558
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,950
was like alright alright I was okay with

559
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,660
it in this in a way if you can end the

560
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,090
film in a satisfactory manner but he's

561
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,100
not dead they do another trope haha I

562
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,000
shot him through them the cheek didn't

563
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,950
destroy his teeth or anything he

564
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,750
apparently had his mouth open or

565
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,150
something oh yeah he did look pretty

566
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,640
 up yeah that was a good acting

567
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,770
know some good acting there but he gets

568
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,240
up and you're like what the and

569
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,760
then he just so happens to walk across

570
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,850
the the convoy where after they murdered

571
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,380
him they take the girl and I guess

572
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,650
they're taking her back to Reyes to sell

573
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,050
her to the cars or the other cartel or

574
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,240
never started the rival cartel whichever

575
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,520
we never figured out but the helicopters

576
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,830
come down Josh Brolin and he's gonna

577
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,080
murder the girl and everybody and at

578
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,640
first I thought he shot her man when he

579
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,590
opened that door and the guys like you

580
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,970
know no I'm gonna kill her anything

581
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,840
 did you did you think that she

582
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,880
died I thought they did no I think she

583
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,010
died be no Wikus in the helicopter they

584
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,870
say where is she where's the prize and

585
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,940
they says passenger-side this and then

586
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,350
he said our prizes in the driver's side

587
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,090
or he says the other thing no but they

588
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,280
won't they are going to kill him just be

589
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,080
but you knew that oh I just want to know

590
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,390
where she gets you it like you said like

591
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,580
his his heart grew and I knew that he

592
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,050
was gonna do something stupid it

593
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,790
all yeah he didn't say what are the

594
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,770
rules of engagement it all he makes

595
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,780
the decision anyway they faked out the

596
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,730
audience like the killers they really

597
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,200
don't and the guys are like what the

598
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,270
 you doing and he puts her on the

599
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,180
helicopter and they don't go no sir

600
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,330
you know they they all fall in line cuz

601
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,980
it's his team that's his guy so that

602
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,600
makes sense and now they're gonna put

603
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,920
her in witness protection

604
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,030
I don't know how they're gonna put her

605
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:47,070
on the border and the government wants

606
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,120
to murder but do with you right well we

607
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,070
were gonna murder our own operative and

608
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,900
the chick you don't think will murder

609
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,090
her later or you if you bring her back

610
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,440
what the is your problem so so so

611
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,450
we're like what the hell

612
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,810
Benicio del Toro wakes up he wanders the

613
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,270
desert until he finds the exact trucks

614
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,790
that were blown apart by the helicopters

615
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,160
gets in one of them drives starts

616
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,430
driving hits a pole but then has reverse

617
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,440
all he grenades some boys which was

618
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,330
awesome it make any sense I thought

619
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,770
maybe it was a police officer was

620
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,360
driving on the opposite side but it was

621
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,820
more of sicarios and he just tosses a

622
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,030
grenade in there blows up and resolves

623
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,120
to wouldn't do nothing for a year

624
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,000
because it says one year later here

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,030
comes the this 15 year old who's now 16

626
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,420
and six but they're not good-looking

627
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,760
like I just have an article or like a

628
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,140

632
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,400
little low I don't know chuckles point

the back and boom there is the guy that

635
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,150

636
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,320

650
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,529
and the whole film it cheapens him and

651
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:42,440
it's so stupid and it doesn't even

652
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,749
resolve the more important plot line

653
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,070
than you've been talking about the whole

654
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,279
 L the little girl what happens

655
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,720
when they go across the border so now we

656
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,249
literally have to wait for the third

657
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:54,499
film to get that resolution although

658
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,659
nobody in the audience gives a at

659
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,429
this point okay because it was such a

660
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,769
poor a storyline and they didn't build

661
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:02,330
up the girl enough to where you actually

662
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,999
gave a about her like honestly if

663
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,559
they kill her I'd have been like well

664
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
that sucks you know probably shouldn't

665
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,399
be punching little girls at school and

666
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,409
being a little asshole

667
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:18,019
no I'm playing they do try to you know

668
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,330
make make her a sympathetic character

669
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,090
and she does actually an alright job of

670
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,669
acting so she'll stare down you know the

671
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,739
Hitman definitely believe that she's

672
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,989
like evil way she's definitely like not

673
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,389
evil but like talk like a if she

674
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:33,649
Ana if she hadn't made that she didn't

675
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:35,029
like she's like I want you to like throw

676
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:36,350
in front of a bus like she's definitely

677
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,609
given that order yeah which is you know

678
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:42,769
once she even if they returned her to

679
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:46,369
her father that those little coyotes

680
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:48,259
cinnamon like I want all of them dead

681
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,509
for just for putting the you put

682
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,820
the tape on my face like you know how

683
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,769
how much that hurts aunt when you take

684
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,919
that off anyways so yeah one more

685
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,460
thing we're more clear so Benicio del

686
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,659
Toro is having a little conference with

687
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,950
a little girl and says we need to make

688
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,929
sure our lives are the same oh yeah yeah

689
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:10,100
you tell them I you paid me to act as

690
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,720
your father and I will tell them the

691
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,249
same thing so our lives are the same and

692
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:14,960
then the second they're separated she

693
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,399
goes with the plan and says no I

694
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,549
she says exactly the lie and he changes

695
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,889
it so it's his own damn what why why

696
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,130
would he know you're

697
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,560
confused let me help me with this one

698
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,300
that was the plan if they went to the

699
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,070
border police and the border police was

700
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,600
asking them questions and they got

701
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,990
caught by u.s. Border Patrol that wasn't

702
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,750
the plan when they when the Coyotes turn

703
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,580
on them and realized that he's a cop

704
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,230
because the frickin fifteen-year-old

705
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,540
recognized him I don't know why she did

706
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,860
that I don't know why she said that

707
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,720
because at the last minute she he said

708
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,000
is he working for Reyes cuz he tries to

709
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,860
get out of the situation by saying look

710
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,200
she's very dangerous I'm transporting

711
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,970
I'm with Reyes I guess they don't

712
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,720
believe him

713
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,700
even though she says yes he's with our

714
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,160
my father hired him so that way there

715
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,840
was only a conditional like they didn't

716
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,000
say if we get caught by these guys he

717
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
just said if we get caught this is our

718
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,600
lives no six was supposed to be a double

719
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,030
lie if they got caught by the Border

720
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,620
Patrol and they were saying oh they're

721
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,200
lying she's told a different line he

722
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,820
told a different lie so they really are

723
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,800
well I mean that makes sense but that's

724
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,150
not what they said at all like that

725
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,380
could have been what his intention was

726
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,090
but it just said like guess what our lie

727
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,160
is and then he changes and gets shot in

728
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,520
the face so he yeah and there was just a

729
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,330
bunch of hey he didn't he probably only

730
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,310
lost like what two teeth and we get to

731
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,980
the thing is the guy never gets

732
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,230
revenge they tease this revenge all

733
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,250
you're gonna get revenge on Reyes and

734
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,020
all you shoot the lawyer you did shoot

735
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,780
the guy like it was the weirdest finger

736
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,210
in the like in the trigger this does

737
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,400
Lissa's like we would yeah if you want

738
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,080
to shoot everybody at the shooting range

739
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,300
Joe you they can't control that crap

740
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,290
anyways and this was Mexico City and

741
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,970
it's funny because the cars are just you

742
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,440
know as he's going the Carl mm-hmm they

743
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,740
don't care because there was no police

744
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,650
the cars weren't you know people weren't

745
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,750
screaming I was like damn man

746
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,720
brutal ass plays um yeah so he gets half

747
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,299
revenge he gets the lawyer and maybe in

748
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,020
the third film he'll get the drug boss

749
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,510
but he won't because they're no longer a

750
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,940
team and now he's really pissed at that

751
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,169
one lady did four shops lady he said

752
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,000
he's gonna come kill you if he lives

753
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,299
he's gonna come kill you all yeah the

754
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,770
brother and then they'll do another

755
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,419
mission where they go and kill the car

756
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,700
to kit is the cartel even matter anymore

757
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,650
no because I thought this was originally

758
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,240
about like Muslim terrorists and then

759
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,309
admitted with Somali pirates and then it

760
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,140
was a cartel and it's not really cartel

761
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,030
because we saw no one from any cartel at

762
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,360
all

763
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,190
Ravi's always corrupt cops and so then

764
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,870
it was just a story about how the

765
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,820
government over their black ops

766
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,640
cuz like it does not make me like want

767
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,440
to go out and go see the third Warner's

768
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,900
you know addressing the world I don't

769
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,159
want to see it I don't want to see that

770
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,080
I wanted to see this movie and I

771
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,030
definitely didn't want to see dress yeah

772
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,490
yeah and that's why it hurts more that's

773
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,500
why we were harder on our ratings on it

774
