2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,440
episode of kick starter crap today we're

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,150
gonna do the old keyword technique this

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,189
time instead of spinning a wheel we're

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,410
gonna listen to a baby cry until it

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:23,850
lands on the proper keyword that's the

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,420

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,079
no randomness to the keyword generator

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,719
is meticulously planned by me I find a

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,610
project that I like and then I find some

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,829
other projects that are sort of

13
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:42,239
marginally related yeah you clicked on

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,710

22
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,900
many times have you attached to the

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,110
bathroom and sat down on a wet sticky

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,070
seat

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,119

27
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,630
your pee because I can't do that usually

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,670
it's just wet if I let it sit there a

29
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,560
while it might become sticky and if it's

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,060
sticky how is that gonna make you fall

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,740
into a cold toilet that might actually

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,500
just be a nice bit of grip for you maybe

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,270
you didn't notice that the toilet seat

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,700
was up so you ended up falling into the

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,909
cold bowl and have to struggle

36
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,350
ungracefully to get yourself loose oh

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,439
how sad for you you were so out to lunch

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,360
that you didn't know the toilet seat was

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,530
up you walked into the bathroom

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,409
blindfolded you just thought hey it's

41
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,299
probably in the right state right now

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,610
let me just fucking sit down without

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,619

their bathroom manners or a full-grown

58
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,570
partner that you suspect was raised in a

59
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,110
jungle

60
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,740

61
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,930

62
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,270
aka he journeys all over the toilet seat

63
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,550
just fucking break up with him just if

64
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,770
he can't clean up his urine that's on

65
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,270
the toilet seat or whatever the case may

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,570
be

67
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,670
just fucking drop him drop his ass off

68
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,200
on the street you don't give him a

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,850
little fucking tutorial this is how you

70
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,460
adult on the other hand if your woman is

71
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,290
falling into the bowl of the toilet seat

72
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,060
kick her out on the street because

73
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,070
you're both fucking retarded when the

74
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,500
seat is lifted it reinforces the good

75
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,200
behavior with a cheerful thanks for

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,750
lifting the seat this is not a thing nor

77
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,700
should it be a thing we don't need a

78
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,950
jingle to tell us to wipe our ass crack

79
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,810
we don't need a jingle to tell us to put

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,000
the milk back in the fridge we just do

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,170
it because that's sort of the

82
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:27,270
responsibility that we have good job

83
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,180
that's right good job for putting down

84
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,850
the toilet seat you absolute fucking

85
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,160
legend I can't believe you were able to

86
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,959
do that were you actually able to wipe

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,209
your ass as well because that you are

88
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,340
truly a God among men why don't you

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,130
throw on an expansion pack that says now

90
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,209
wash your hands good little boy I'm

91
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,350
tired of sitting on a toilet seat

92
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,300
covered with sticky P or shockingly

93
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,830
dipping into the bowl when the seat has

94
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,690
been left up those are two separate

95
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,640
issues if the seats been left up it

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,580
should be closed and this product solves

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,200
that problem right because it makes a

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,060
bunch of fucking noise assuring you to

99
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,170
close the toilet seat

100
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,510
it doesn't say remember clean up your

101
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,209
piss mass you fucking ape you can get a

102
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,790
tinkle trainer for 14 dollars which i

103
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,430
think is a very reasonable price or you

104
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,530
can purchase my tinkle training kits

105
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,330
which is called the piss in your

106
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,989
backyard kit which costs $0 it saves you

107
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:24,390
a shit ton of money on your water bill

108
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,010
it saves hundreds of

109
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,420
thousands of gallons of water per year

110
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,940
or if that seems outlandish to you you

111
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,860
can go ahead and buy my pee like a woman

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,540
kit where you just sit on the toilet and

113
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,090
you piss like a woman cutting-edge

114
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,490
technology enables the tinkle trainer to

115
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,900
detect the seats movement and

116
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,970
orientation I don't I don't think it's

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,040
cutting-edge technology I think you know

118
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,750
it's not fucking cutting-edge it's a

119
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,940
fucking sensor that's been around for

120
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,070
over a decade it's basically the same

121
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,750
sort of technology that you have in a

122
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,550
birthday card that sings to you our

123
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,290
daddy taught us not to be ashamed of our

124
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,540
dick I won't give them credit with the

125
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,310
name I think tinkle trainer is a good

126
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,010
name it's got a literation but it's it's

127
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,320
a b-plus okay it's not a plus I think

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,720
they could take it to an A+ level if

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,780
they called it's tinkle tuner because

130
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,790
then you can integrate maybe a little

131
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,490
spokesperson maybe a little spokesperson

132
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,200
type fairy that comes around maybe a bit

133
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,150
of an alien-type fairy spokesperson that

134
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,860
comes around watches you pee you might

135
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,440
be down your III maybe you close lead

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,720
mouth that could be a cool part of a

137
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,540
pitch video toilet bowl deodorizer

138
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,280
introducing the new memo memo act book

like that and asked for 250,000 dollars

148

lack of bullshit they have in their

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,259
description and in the reward tiers it

153
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,090
just offers one reward tier which is the

154
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,979
stink stopper and that's all they want

155
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,020
to sell anyway it's like why you know

169
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,659

170
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,780

it and if they forget to do it how about

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,889
you just fucking look this is gonna be

173
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,539
like one of those shower apron projects

174
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,340
where i voice my opinion about how

175
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,469
fucking retarded it is and how it isn't

176
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:10,699
an issue because I don't have a long

177
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,050
hair and I don't know the fucking

178
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,880
struggles of get collecting hair in your

179
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,159
ass crack when you're in the shower but

180
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:19,060
this I'm surely this is different right

181
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,529
you heard him Kickstarter using the

182
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,229
bathroom in the dark is serious business

183
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,729
using the bathroom in the dark is

184
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,400
serious business if I turn on the

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,069
bathroom white it's gonna walk my eyes I

186
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,919
won't be able to go back to sweet for

187
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,740
hours I still don't get how adding a

188
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,360
nightlight is all of a sudden going to

189
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,340
correct the behavior that people aren't

190
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,110
putting the toilet seat down don't worry

191
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,909
everyone I'm not gonna say that this is

192
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,219
complete crap you know because it's

193
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,469
cheap and it does serve a purpose okay

194
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,719
that's that's good enough most of the

195
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,819
time maybe when I'm a corpse or an

196
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,469
alcoholic and I'm going to the bathroom

197
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,389
all the time at night then I'll have a

198
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,550
use for the Illuma bowl but as a person

199
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,219
with normal bowels that urinates three

200
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,680
or four times a day maybe max I really

201
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,919

202
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,889

203
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,840
think it's gimmicky but I liken it to

204
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,710

205

208
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,099

209
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,699
