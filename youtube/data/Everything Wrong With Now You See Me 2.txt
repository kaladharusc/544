whole crowd to go see his dad

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,080

Morgan Freeman that's literally the only

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,200
reporter on the scene and it's being

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,030
filmed by multiple news stations despite

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,290
being a magic debunker and not a

19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,200
reporter yeah I never sent Josh a Morgan

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,550

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,530

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,239
movie in case you walked into a movie

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,890

27
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,219
it's reasonable for me to ask how this

28
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,020
asshole in prison got in cell private

29
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,430

37
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,010

trip was performed eight years ago and

60
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,340

61
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,520
even if she looks like Lizzy Caplan over

62
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,000

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640

66
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,479
these movies oh she was pregnant at the

67
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,330
time well how convenient

70
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,560
your apartment set up a Rube Goldberg

71
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,630

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,070
of your first attempt to tie her up and

73
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,630
now you think you have assault what is

74
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,070
it with stupid-ass people in movies

75
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,230
I'm the new horseman seems like this is

76
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,070
something Dylan could have easily

77
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,450
informed the group about well before she

78
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,860
was introduced but when I keep your

79
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,480
secret magic team in the loop right we

80
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,040
have been rehearsing for months for

81
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,750
something we don't even know what it is

82
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,000
well why did you do that that's a long

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,560
time to trust a magic FBI guys word

84
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,900
right I mean without results I'm not

85
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,470
going anywhere

86
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,210
but I'm mm I'm taking care of myself it

87
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,590
appears that Jesse Eisenberg didn't

88
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,850
really quit ass Lex Luthor when he got

89
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,200
on the set of this movie you want to

90
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,550
know what all this has been leading to

91
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,830
Octus hosting the launch of the next-gen

92
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,630
cell phone once these phones at the

93
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,280
streets they'll siphon their users

94
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,700
information to the black market also

95
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,320
really they've been biding their time

96
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,120
waiting for an evil cellphone maker to

97
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,020
release a phone

98
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,760
why not magic The Forgotten terrorists

99
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,620
our mission is to hijack the show

100
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,570

101
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,220
for hijacking a cell phone launch a year

102
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,780
in advance without knowing that's what

103
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,070
it's going to be until just before the

104
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,600
show and why was that such privileged

105
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,860
information they couldn't inform their

106
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,030
trusted members that's what they were

107
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,200
training for this is what we've been

108
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,120
waiting for now it's time to get the

109
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,450
world

110
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,890
since when do the world's best magicians

111
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,810
blindly sign up to be basically MacGyver

112
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,310
going after wrongdoers and corporate

113
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,019
Stooges also why are they all shining

114
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,370
their flashlights on these blueprints in

115
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,989
the shot that's no flashlight activated

116
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,480
blueprints or an actual thing

117
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,099
man that journalist have got to be

118
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,690
pissed that blockers got billing above

119
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,519

00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,580
actually fucking works

122
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,140
I should be a magician because I'm great

123
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,370
with people and have frequently talked

124
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,470
strangers into signing iPads impossible

125
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,709
Bell toss guy just came flies you know

126
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,780
notorious horseman Daniel Atlas who's

127
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,340
been in all the news over the past year

128
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,110
anybody recognize I guess not that's

129
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,959
your Evans mental facility Marc D stooge

130
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
these guys would hold this guy way

131
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,930
without checking with the powers that be

132
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,549
first is an integral part of this

133
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,019
year-long plan being put into motion

134
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,819
right now when I was a cool scientist

135
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,200
but the four horsemen relying on

136
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,879
strangers to abide by random safety

137
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,590
science that's a battle and wait isn't

138
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,970
this just a live feed why is it

139
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,590
recording and if it's recording wouldn't

140
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,849
someone see the tape where Woody

141
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,260
Harrelson's face is in the shot he's

142
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,299
obviously hypnotized this guy ladies and

143
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,099
gentlemen the horsemen aren't they

144
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,870
wanted criminals doesn't Twitter betray

145
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,250
their location in a matter of seconds

146
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,540
shouldn't they get arrested before they

147
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,069
finished the introductions this guy here

148
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,150
in the crowd is yelling weird the

149
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,130
redhead horsemen go ah so I was right

150
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,479
about the instant police response but

151
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,070
wrong and thinking the horsemen couldn't

152
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,990
foil the FBI with the old lock the doors

153
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,880
routine we got an anonymous phone call

154
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,620
an hour ago confirms everything I've

155
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,970
been telling her but we're not going to

156
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,289
arrest you right now or anything because

157
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,030
that would be silly Max Headroom years

158
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,590
as a thing and because this guy already

159
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,570
suspected Rhoades he fucking slams him

160
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,740
and tries to cuff him what are they

161
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,300
really rehearsing during that whole year

162
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,979
that didn't really involve magic they

163
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,510
made the octa guy what he was doing in

164
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,919
front of a crowd but then they all came

165
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,090
out and started telling the crowd in

166
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,440
more detail how this guy was screwing

167
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,820
them and what were they going to do

168
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,110
afterward they are running for their

169
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,669
lives but this asshole took the time to

170
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,050
change out of his green security guard

171
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,060
outfit how is this possible

172
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,620
it's not though the movie will go on

173
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,910
later to try and use some hypnosis

174
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,280
bullshit which is just as bolted as any

175
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,840
other explanations this movie offers

176
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,340
also these guys were apparently

177
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,930
introduced to a world where real magic

178
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,610
exists and one of their members is now

179
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,620
asking how it's possible also of course

180
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,150
they ended up in China because Chinese

181
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,620
audiences won't accept anything that has

182
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,150
no China in it and they censor the word

183
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,030
pandering what the actual movie this is

184
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,280
my twin brother chase what the actual

185
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,380
movie also character has a twin brother

186
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,060
or any kind of sibling that they never

187
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,590
mentioned before cliche the greatest

188
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,080
magicians in the world are the object of

189
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,510
someone else's magic trick it's not

190
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,030
poetic I don't really know it's stupid

191
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,219
this is some Eddie Murphy movie hey I

192
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,780
will sit no to the sequel that's okay

193
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,009
we'll just double would you screen

194
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,199
time will give him a twin brilliant I'm

195
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,639
pretty sure he's still driving an FBI

196
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,349
issued car I'm also pretty sure that

197
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:42,819
they'd be able to track that and his

198
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,439
cell phone but this movie is too busy

199
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,729
surprising you to care about petty

200
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,289
details like logic and common sense

201
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,860
wham-o close ammo delivery guy came to

202
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,899
your door Merritt who is in hiding

203
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,249
apparently but lives in a regular house

204
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:55,509
apartment decides that checking the

205
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,129
peephole is for suckers son opens the

206
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,869
door for any asshole who drinks how did

207
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,490
you know how to find him is this movie

208
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,629
really trying to tell us that these guys

209
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,249
are hiding out so well that nobody could

210
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,449
possibly find them they don't wear

211
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,830
disguises and they live in apartments

212
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,240
where they could be seen daily it's not

213
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,319
like they're in a bunker and I don't

214
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,939
know what I'd to lean while I marvel at

215
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,649
how much the city shots remind me of The

216
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,669
Fast and Furious movies

217
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,139
I'm also marvel at how this movie is

218
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,939
actually somehow more both than the Fast

219
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,389
&amp; Furious movies I just want to be end

220
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,719
and I am 100% off the grid you were not

221
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,520
off the grid dick you might be living

222
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,050
under an assumed name but as long as

223
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,279
you're in a penthouse apartment with

224
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,599
electricity this is the very definition

225
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,389
of on the grid dick I'd like that we had

226
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,889
a dream movie goes for the super

227
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,689
discount gates jobs angle because this

228
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,189
movie believes it's original and clever

229
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,930
right down to the casting of King Harry

230
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,059
Potter as the villain it can unencrypt

231
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,949
and the same track the defense firewall

232
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,110
suits the kansai or the box from

233
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,699
sneakers we're calling your bluff

234
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,559
actually we'll do it because I speak for

235
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,849
everyone in this group here and there

236
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,169
will be no argument for some reason

237
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,849
sending the idea that this wanted

238
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,439
criminal can still visit prisoners at a

239
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,240
federal penitentiary and that this guard

240
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,349
hasn't heard the news yet about this

241
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,269
super famous FBI agent having turned out

242
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,680
to be a criminal even if he is using

243
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,990
Cowan's FBI credentials what else ladies

244
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,979
and gentlemen in prison

245
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,269
this article repeats itself five times

246
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,949
and pretty much all the other articles

247
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,870
around it repeat all the same paragraphs

248
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,339
from this one making it the worst case

249
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,930
of plagiarism and repetition in media

250
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,639
history and I didn't get to finish my

251
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,649
lobster this motherfucker has lobster

252
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,509
dinners a computer a flat-screen of

253
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,669
cooking a spresso machine a lazy boy and

254
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,959
all the privacy in the world

255
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,699
this isn't prison this is my idea in

256
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,830
heaven man hi how are ya Daniel believes

257
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,569
that in Macau you can just go and speak

258
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,800
English to anybody and they'll know

259
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,909
what's up we're going through a very

260
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,399
sensitive metal detector so plastic

261
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,240
nothing metal it is absolutely

262
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,979
incredible how unlikable Daniel atlas is

263
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,180
in this movie and he's supposed to be

264
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,680
our main protagonist what did she say

265
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,779
she says just because you are talking

266
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,059
sorry and moving your hands doesn't mean

267
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,740
she can subtly on the stain wish this

268
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,360
guy would be amazing at cinema since but

269
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,860
what a terrible scene this is when the

270
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,449
old lady asked why he needs something in

271
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:49,810
plastic

272
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,160
rather than getting the younger guy to

273
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,810
translate for him he tries to talk to

274
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,490
her in this demeaning manner all set up

275
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,080
for a joke but then after he scolded for

276
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,370
speaking that way he doesn't even bother

277
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,200
trying to get this guy to translate for

278
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
it and simply moves on as if it's a lost

279
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,480
cause

280
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,740
so that's how we've been contacting the

281
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,570
I you've been doing it on your own what

282
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,160
was the process by which Atlas figured

283
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,900
out how to talk to the AI and later we

284
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,980
find out he's been talking to Daniel

285
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,970
Radcliffe the whole time who's

286
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,590
pretending to be the I so how did that

287
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,200
happen is it weird to have more hair in

288
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,150
your nose than on your head

289
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,560
movie thinks the split screen this

290
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,910
hilarious simply by existing and

291
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,500
declines to include any dialogue or

292
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,910
action year that is worth watching this

293
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,169
is literally watch would you play off

294
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,270
what he seen for the sake of hey so how

295
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,740
did the convicted felon who's out of

296
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,300
prison on a one day something something

297
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
and the disgraced FBI agent the entire

298
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,900
agency is looking for managed to charter

299
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,430
a private jet this is the thing that the

300
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,020
check is very thin luckily it's similar

301
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
and weight and size to a playing card

302
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,580
luckily the South African gangsters

303
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,169
security detail somehow gets completely

304
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,060
flummoxed by a dragon costume separating

305
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,560
them from their client and don't seem to

306
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,029
be in any hurry to make sure he isn't in

307
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:46,960
any danger right now

308
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,610
well noting its predecessor and movie

309
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,930
takes hypnosis all the way to the

310
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,730
goddamn moon I got your email dr.

311
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,410
McLucas you had a query about our

312
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,300
ability to maintain quantum coherence at

313
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,770
room temperature somehow even though

314
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,820
they knew everything about this South

315
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,200
African gangster they did not do enough

316
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,790
research to know who was who in his

317
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,560
entourage leading to these comic hijinks

318
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,830
that are so hilarious

319
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,790
[Applause]

320
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,589
are you kidding me you knew you'd have

321
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,210
to walk through a metal detector and the

322
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,620
chip was metal but you went through with

323
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,760
the plan without knowing how you were

324
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,640
gonna beat that 820 million cubic miles

325
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,100
of dizzy synaptic residents two hours

326
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,570
and nine minutes of absolute garbage

327
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,610
babble bulls now you see me to ghost

328
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,270
Protocol

329
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,770
okay so they replace the microchip with

330
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,900
a comb or whatever the fuck isn't this

331
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,730
thing a microchip meaning taking out of

332
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,410
the computer will cause it computer not

333
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,820
to work any more alarms going off

334
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,589
warnings about a missing microchip it's

335
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,060
a good thing no one is looking this

336
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,470
direction and that there are no cameras

337
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,910
in this super important high security

338
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,290
room I mean right

339
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,060
also Penn &amp; Teller watch the scene and

340
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,620
promptly vomited and no they were not

341
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,150
fooled I don't care how good you aren't

342
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,290
throwing cards there's no way you

343
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,760
practice this throw under these kinds of

344
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,290
conditions to make it perfect go fuck

345
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,760
yourself I know it's supposed to be fun

346
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,290
and everything but it looks piggish so

347
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,370
I'm actively rooting for them to get

348
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,790
caught

349
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,230
guard can every single one of these

350
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,730
assholes has to perform sleight of hand

351
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,110
with this card that has the microchip on

352
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,820
it but why couldn't Jack just keep the

353
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,900
card after he got searched

354
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,400
why did he throw it to Daniel so he'd

355
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,140
have to do all the same only to pass it

356
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,190
on to Loula who also

357
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,450
to do the same we are now supposed to

358
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,770
believe that merit got good at this in

359
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,540
that montage we saw earlier that nobody

360
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,980
saw this and why did they get merit to

361
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,480
do this why didn't they just make it so

362
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,950
that merits wallet got confiscated at

363
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,360
the beginning and make it Dave Franco's

364
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,860
job to throw the car also this plan

365
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,780
entirely relies on a protocol where the

366
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,460
guards pass a confiscated wallet through

367
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,020
a metal detector so that the horsemen

368
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,640
can do this simultaneous card throwing

369
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,880
trick to beat the system oh wow you

370
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,380
speak Mandarin we're gonna need to put

371
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,690
them watching Dao well I can eat young

372
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,060
everybody speaks Mandarin because magic

373
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,920
the oldest magic shop in the world in

374
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,750
Macau has a false back that opens into

375
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,890
what I can only describe as a ninja

376
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,240
turtles rumor requirement

377
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
he's was the fathers we find out later

378
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,450
that these shop owners are part of the I

379
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,040
so it makes sense they know who Shrike

380
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,690
is but Shrike doesn't know that and he

381
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,250
did reveal his identity unless they

382
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,630
overheard Thaddeus and him all the way

383
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,350
across the magic shop some bullsh even

384
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,060
for this movie but whatever I'm actually

385
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,560
writing these sins with my left hand on

386
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,910
my right hand is skimming through the TV

387
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,230
Guide looking for MasterChef Canada

388
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,000
reruns some pus on the scholarship and

389
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,190
I'm abric of you I'm assuming it was

390
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,260
actually not you who walked into Newberg

391
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,970
federal prison these assholes are just

392
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,410
now finding this out how do you think we

393
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,780
were able to find him your phone I asked

394
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,670
to see the face behind all of this will

395
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,110
you actually put your phone on was a by

396
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,180
wave siphon pad what an absolute bat

397
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,430
crazy plan luckily worked in Mabry's

398
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,900
favor so he could download everyone's

399
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,490
personal information this is obvious

400
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,290
subterfuge that Mabry will fall forward

401
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,790
we give Marvel movies aren't time for

402
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,710
overcutting fight scenes but Jesus this

403
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,420
movie took the same class but OD don't

404
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,850
extra credit it's like 10 of you know

405
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,680
decent tricks movie is going to try to

406
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,540
make me believe that Dylan who all now

407
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,280
is a great magician somehow winning

408
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,870
because he's able to do magic tricks in

409
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,170
an uncontrolled environment stuff like

410
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,790
this for example in this movie magic

411
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,500
equals iron monkey villain levels of

412
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,290
fabric control that's Lionel Shrike safe

413
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,420
which any self-respecting magician would

414
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,830
recognize on sight from a hundred yards

415
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,720
away done movie thinks it's gonna

416
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,130
surprise me with some sort of Michael

417
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,570
Caine reveal that I guessed as soon as I

418
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,860
saw Daniel Radcliffe in this movie

419
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,480
ultimately this entire sequel is a

420
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,770
revenge plot from the last movies

421
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,660
outcome which is the creative equivalent

422
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,160
of a shark instead of just killing the

423
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,780
guy they decide that his death needs to

424
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,430
be poetic in some way to put him in a

425
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,200
safe that is for magicians and leave it

426
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,820
to chance and of course the bad guys

427
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,830
toss a magician into a magician safe and

428
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,660
didn't bother to take his belongings his

429
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,260
day

430
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,660
don't make themselves now you will find

431
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,210
yourself in a very similar position to

432
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,730
mr. Rhodes yeah but why what did

433
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,080
Thaddeus do to you in the last movie

434
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
that makes you angry at him also if you

435
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,170
haven't guessed Morgan Freeman there's

436
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,460
actually a good guy in this movie you've

437
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,270
never seen a movie

438
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,070
hoist my neck smacking at all so this is

439
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,360
a clear issue with the I in this movie

440
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,980
so secretive they won't even let you

441
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,330
know who's working with you and what you

442
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,070
need to do to succeed because Atlas

443
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,660
needed to be here to pull Dylan out of

444
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,160
the water but only knew to be here

445
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,420
because the bad guys were loading his

446
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,890
dad's death safe into the back of a

447
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,150
truck and followed it but what if they

448
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,860
didn't see that feeling come on buddy

449
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,660
breathe he says this despite none of

450
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,400
them attempting CPR he just thinks this

451
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,570
guy's gonna start breathing on his own

452
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,490
he may be a world-class magician but his

453
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,720
ass did not pay attention in health

454
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,610
class sake I didn't bother to check

455
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,960
between the time we stole in and out

456
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,310
even though I can apparently tell it's

457
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,810
fake nasaan sight and I was the one that

458
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,280
took its fake ass out of the bad guys

459
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,030
computer you were chosen all of you it's

460
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,040
magic movie just inception itself so

461
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,650
lose it god damn it this movie in it's

462
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,420
characters did not need a who's in I'm

463
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,880
an one by one scene it has one but it he

464
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,190
doesn't need it if he's thinking YouTube

465
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,360
live streaming reaches the entire

466
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,100
world's population he's super duper

467
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,750
mistake how do we stay ahead of them we

468
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,460
need to get to London by midnight

469
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,250
wait what how the I mean where did you

470
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,270
pull that I mean movie makes it seem

471
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,710
like everyone in the world would just

472
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,240
stand up in delight at the mere sight of

473
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,870
Jack Wilder

474
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,130
when at least three of these people

475
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,960
would likely call the cops now here is

476
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,430
Loula just join the horsemen in this

477
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,720
movie and up until this point has had

478
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,100
only one public appearance that failed

479
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,870
miserably yet everyone regards her leg

480
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,400
she's isla Fisher from that last movie

481
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,020
already why are there so many people

482
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,760
standing out in a downpour right outside

483
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,740
wherever that this is I know he's about

484
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,720
to magic it but 95% of these people are

485
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,430
not actually here in a downpour in real

486
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,850
life

487
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,440
freeze that ensue min zoom and enhance

488
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,020
cliche he's dead we watched him drown

489
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,300
out actually no face you didn't you did

490
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,740
the same thing every Bond villain ever

491
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,120
does and assume he drowned before

492
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,760
verifying it not make it naked go up

493
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,410
this is like a really bad Crystal Pepsi

494
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,900
commercial that was an act of me you're

495
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,460
wearing a microphone but where the fuck

496
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,660
are the speakers and why doesn't your

497
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,220
voice sound even a little bit amplified

498
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,420
that was an act of B

499
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,910
and of strobe lights and rain machines

500
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,470
obviously this trick needed rain

501
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,120
machines to work but how come everybody

502
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
in the area had umbrellas on them

503
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,209
already yeah I know it's London and it

504
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,380
rains all the time but surely the

505
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,820
forecast showed a clear night and there

506
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,779
would have been less umbrellas than

507
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,910
usual actually impossible god damn it

508
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,130
also impossible this movie is just curry

509
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,570
on top of curry but because it has

510
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,070
actors you like you end up thinking this

511
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,779
horse is entertaining when it really is

512
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,470
just whore

513
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,180
this magician dude goes full boring for

514
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,730
a few minutes because of course it does

515
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,990
because motorcycles always explode on

516
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,940
impact we later find out this whole

517
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,320
thing is a setup by the horsemen to get

518
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,910
caught by tesslar and is met now

519
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,199
normally we've mentioned the prestige

520
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,550
level of commitment these guys are

521
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,570
bringing to the set up but that would

522
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,459
actually be likely in this case only the

523
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,199
acting here is way above and beyond to

524
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,550
the point that the actors don't even

525
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,839
appear to know that their characters are

526
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:57,350
in on it

527
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,940
also note that Tesla's already tried

528
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,350
throwing Dylan into a safe and dropping

529
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,120
it into the river so he should have a

530
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
short fuse and just kill these guys

531
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,850
right now and search them for the chip

532
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,690
later nope

533
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,310
instead he does everything according to

534
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,440
the Horseman's plant surreal how does

535
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,970
the microchip reel didn't they have a

536
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,529
fake one how did they make this past the

537
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:12,829
test

538
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,570
this is never explained at all we find

539
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,829
out later that the whole showcase for

540
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:17,240
the microchip was staged but that

541
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,260
doesn't explain how they thought the

542
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,910
microchip was fake and now it's real the

543
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,410
champagne tastes weird so of course he

544
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,760
peels off the label immediately right

545
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,790
the tennis stroke of midnight New Year's

546
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:33,620
Eve is that microphone still working so

547
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,000
they were broadcasting this around the

548
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,920
world but Tressler and Mabry and all the

549
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,790
people who work for them weren't

550
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,649
watching did the horsemen accomplish

551
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,699
that or know where that would happen

552
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:42,470
here's the most unbelievable thing in

553
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,360
the movie by far somehow Jack managed to

554
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,709
be here hypnotizing Merritt's brother

555
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,360
also being back at the other place

556
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,949
playing fine the lady game with the

557
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,160
adoring public these man destroyed

558
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,470
people's lives and that's when most

559
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,730
people would probably start heading for

560
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,529
the exits it's when the magic show gets

561
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,380
preachy that they lose the audience

562
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,680
awesome

563
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,569
but you horsemen are all still super one

564
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,250
at criminals though right this doesn't

565
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,110
change that does it uh even this so

566
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,790
unformed it might as well be a zygote

567
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,199
romance story gets wrapped up nicely

568
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,449
huzzah and by huzzah I mean give me a

569
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,819
goddamn break already ten minutes this

570
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,800
new FBI director person has absolutely

571
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,120
no real connection to do and whatsoever

572
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,769
but because he's giving her a flash

573
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,600
drive full of alleged info on Pressler

574
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,069
and mabry she's okay with this guy

575
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,269
getting a head start for some reason

576
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,519
even though he's broken plenty of laws

577
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,800
now you're playing the long game Hulk

578
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,870
just pulled a Batman it keeps going and

579
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:40,649
going and going and going and yes your

580
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,600
father and I were partners which in this

581
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,949
incredible world of the Internet

582
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,930
no one ever figured out even his son who

583
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,759
had access to the FBI and lived in this

584
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,500
world of magic didn't know somehow this

585
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,819
is harder to believe than any magic

586
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,529
trick that occurs in these movies why

587
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,940
don't you ever say anything to me I

588
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,829
don't know yeah the usual I did it to

589
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:56,339
protect you

590
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,930
I had guilt shame whatever you want to

591
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,519
call it never once is this excuse made

592
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,810
since ever give it a name shame guilt

593
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,459
regret he's talking about that tie he's

594
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,230
wearing right now right hey guys

595
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,520
you might want to come take a look at

596
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,600
this you might want to come take a look

597
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,780
at this cliche I put you in jail man why

598
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,579
didn't you say something then probably

599
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,900
because his prison cell was better than

600
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,850
my entire house also Thaddeus will now

601
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,990
explain that he didn't want to say

602
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,400
anything because he wanted Dylan to do

603
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,169
this magic but the right motivation he

604
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,000
spent 18 months in prison as an old man

605
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,350
because he didn't want to explain

606
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,880
anything plus it ties up everything so

607
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,290
neatly you'll forget about this being a

608
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,790
major flaw in the film Walter and

609
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,710
Tressler you were they in on it too oh

610
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,620
we knew Walter was in hiding the Optus

611
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,020
show was a setup to expose him to the

612
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,030
public that explains nothing this is

613
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,620
first off a confusing question we're the

614
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,419
people we exposed in on the overall plan

615
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,790
I mean what second off Thaddeus gives

616
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,140
pretty much a nothing answer to the

617
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,909
question in fact pretty much nothing of

618
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,350
this plan is explained at all if they

619
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,610
knew all this then they might be worse

620
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,169
invaders of privacy than Mabry was

621
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:53,909
planning to be also remember this plan

622
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,590
requires them to go to China and one

623
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,880
Horseman who apparently speaks for all

624
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,350
the other unwilling horsemen to do

625
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,150
whatever may be said get the idea to go

626
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,409
to a magic shop that just happens to

627
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,030
have the eye people there along with all

628
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,350
the other lucky happens dances that

629
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,059
occurred and what is overall a poorly

630
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,010
conceived plant now I know why you look

631
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,909
so familiar

632
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,100
you'll the horsemen on you I know this

633
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,630
guy was in the movie earlier and that

634
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,679
this should be some kind of trouble

635
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,450
worthy call back whammy problem is this

636
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,370
movie is so I can't remember where I saw

637
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,350
this dude also yes it is the guy who was

638
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,850
showing them the microchip earlier but

639
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,350
wouldn't it have been nice to know he

640
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,520
was helping them couldn't have made

641
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,190
things a little easier seeing is

642
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,880
believing

643
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,700
but is it true movie rips off the ending

644
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,290
Morgan Freeman narration bit from War of

645
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,940
the Worlds Kinshasa and Million Dollar

646
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,549
Baby Bruce Almighty 7 march of the

647
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,290
Penguins and the studio said who should

648
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,850
we get to direct this piece of maybe the

649
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,200
guy who did one of those step up movies

650
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,850
someone said maybe the person who did

651
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,090
just

652
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,710
Bieber Never Say Never said another Jim

653
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,570
in the Holograms no no we need the guy

654
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,850
who did GI Joe retaliation do you Frank

655
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,620
someone yell suddenly the executives

656
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,299
were at one another's necks punches were

657
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,950
thrown and guns were drawn until Timmy

658
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,270
the intern looked up from his computer

659
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,279
and said guys guys we can get all the

660
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,480
people who did those movies to direct

661
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,500
this movie because it's all the same

662
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,070
person

663
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:06,580
but everyone was too dead to hear

664
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,880
[Music]

665
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,789
yeah it is for most people spend their

666
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:22,130
lives in the dark trying to hide from me

667
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,710
there's a harsh truth to face no way I'm

668
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,240
gonna make it on the outside faith

669
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,909
remember remember the 5th of November

670
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:34,440
you know you really don't need a

671
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,149
forensics team to get to the bottom of

672
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:37,769
this if you guys were the inventors of

673
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,169
Facebook you'd have invented Facebook

674
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:54,900
and I'm yeah no no what am I

675
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,280
I once told you about a sailor who

676
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,220
described drowning to me because he said

677
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,670
it was like going home of a sly he said

678
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,000
it was agony
