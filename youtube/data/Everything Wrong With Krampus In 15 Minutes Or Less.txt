1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,080
Comcast isn't freezing to death in this

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,670
logo this guy decides to retrieve this

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,559
box using this janky-ass ladder just as

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,059
the store opens on what I assume is

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:15,809
Black Friday

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,039
where was this cartoonishly butch

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,449
security when the store opened and that

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,100
mucho mark greeter was trampled people

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,420
fighting over Christmas decorations on

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,130
Black Friday instead of Bapat Mighty

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,900
Morphin Power Rangers Furby or other

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,160
toys that will prove how old I am

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,109
suddenly everyone is calm and orderly in

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,400
the checkout line maybe they saw those

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,840
other people get tasered for no reason

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,219
and realize the security guards at

17
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,930
neutral Mart mean business buy it up is

18
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,460
a kid nativity play happening in this

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,899
store but the local elementary school

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,730
burned down or did the director convince

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,020
them to have it here because it made the

22
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,640
transition easier this guy clearly has a

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,079
mild case of super strength if he's able

24
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,399
to carry that television under one arm

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
and that concludes our delightfully

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
out-of-context slow-mo nightmare holiday

27
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,710
montage even though gramma knows the

28
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,390
Krampus rules she is still presumably

29
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,100
suspicious every Christmas despite no

30
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,570
one summoning him even till the first

31
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,010
graders at Sansa was just a cheap

32
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,300
marketing ploy and then didn't sell

33
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,190
Pepsi coke kid who cannot discern the

34
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,690
difference between Coke and Pepsi even

35
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,070
though Coke is delicious and Pepsi is

36
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,320
garbage was drop kicking him into the

37
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,360
manger really the best way to Halos

38
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,950
there is no way that kid drop kicked

39
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,659
that other kid into any kind of manger

40
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,040
unless his parents allowed the fighting

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,689
to go on will pass the major part and we

42
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,520
missed that after why you pole you can

43
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,350
do that alone how about you just started

44
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,610
a fight in the middle of a play you

45
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,259
can't do that at all go to your room

46
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,729
Jesus this couple is completely forgot

47

48
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,140

49
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,400
family speak in perfect German to

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,990
English translation do they have a Babel

51
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,090
Fish in their ears last year I found in

52
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,090
my bed mom human - the last time that

53
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,189
was their dog mom somehow believes that

54
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,750
her sister's English Bulldog takes

55
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,180
human-sized mom is just now noticing

56
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,439
that Santa is looking at her daughter's

57
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,119
ass instead of when she put the picture

58
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,590
in the frame or when she got the picture

59
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,090
the first time or when she was shown

60
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,950
proof she had plenty of opportunities

61
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,210
before now to look at her own family

62
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,640
photo is what I'm saying

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,690
Howard's Hummer shakes the whole house

64
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,520
because he's obnoxious just want to make

65
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,990
sure you understand that none of that

66
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,270
but with a night off this guy isn't

67
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,100
Randy Quaid in the scene they're just a

68
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,140
little cranky cuz Steelers lost tell

69
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,790

70
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,440
Fitness Award movie uses the previous

71
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,000
five seconds of dialogue to beat me over

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,380
the head with how butch Linda and

73
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,210
Howard's daughters are Oh would you ask

74
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,760
Sid for the Sara tokars video games

75
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,180
phone alysus either Beth inks that Howie

76
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,190
juniors mental challenges are the result

77
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,690
of failing kidneys or she doesn't know

78
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,760
what dialysis is gross fat kid drinking

79
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
soda straight from a two-liter bottle

80
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,970
and then immediately burping cliche as I

81
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,709
was in training Leslie what were you

82
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,380
training for uh said Eagle Scouts for

83
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,520
some reason Howard and company are

84
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,780
acting like being an Eagle Scout is

85
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,340
something to laugh about but becoming an

86
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,810
Eagle Scout is pretty hard right I

87
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,489
wouldn't know because I'm a lazy asshole

88
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,870
but I assume it would require a lot of

89
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,190
discipline and hard work and a

90
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,900
gun-toting survivalist type like Howard

91
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,610
would find it respectable what are you

92
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,730
now a Jew that's actually racist so to

93
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,580
survive he had to slaughter and eat his

94
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,880
reindeer including Rudolph eight tiny

95
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,310
reindeer get it yeah but if you also ate

96
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,959
Rudolph that makes nine so your pun

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,459
basically falls apart this kid hates

98
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,080
Christmas spoiler talk as much as Marty

99
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,489
McFly hates being called a chicken in

100
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:04,900
the Back to the Future sequels it's a

101
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,370
very curious button that sets him off

102
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,989
Max's letter starts to get awkward for

103
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,459
the grown-ups yet no one gets up to stop

104
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,260
Stevie from continuing to read I just

105
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,459
wanted Christmas to be like it used to

106
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,170
be given the max has retained all of his

107
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,580
family members during his life I have

108
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,989
trouble seeing how this Christmas can be

109
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,700
any different from Max's ten previous

110
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,110
Christmases also did someone

111
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,400
cryogenically freeze the kid from

112
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,080
Jumanji and thaw amount last year to be

113
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
in this movie this dartboard in the

114
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,900
background is just asking for darts to

115
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,190
be thrown into the wall around it this

116
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,630
is also an orgy of evidence this is a

117
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,250
boy's room stack of board games

118
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,410
minecraft pictures toy playing numerous

119
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,150
off-screen things I can't even see but I

120
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,470
know were there I mean how do you even

121
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,450
sleep in this room even the assholes you

122
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,640
normally can't stand saying asshole to a

123
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,410
ten year old kid I guess Krampus is able

124
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,880
to interpret a ripped up letter to Santa

125
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,440
as Max wishing his entire family was

126
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,360
gone Kevin McCallister actually said out

127
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,470
loud he wished his family would

128
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,549
disappear and the worst thing that

129
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,049
happened him was Joe Pesci showed up

130
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,700
Krampus rides in on the same clown that

131
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,870
the rhinoceros from James and the Giant

132
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,640
Peach used to eat James's parents

133
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,230
blackout waits to shut down this one

134
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,030
houses power lasts because that's how

135
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,080
electricity works when you've

136
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,550
accidentally summoned a Christmas demon

137
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,050
we find out later that the snowmen that

138
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,819
appear represent people Krampus estate

139
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,409
into the underworld or whatever the

140
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,939
snowman must indicate his first victim

141
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,769
was Abraham Lincoln the Turner's are in

142
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,780
Hawaii the Lambert's are in Florida the

143
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,189
Cartwright's stop talking to us after

144
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,499
masses little incident how convenient

145
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,969
for the impending evil Christmas demon

146
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,709
all the neighbors are out of town except

147
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,120
for the ones they don't talk to causing

148
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,739
them to be completely isolated hey these

149
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,229
two I'm not mine must be from the boys

150
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,000
Brown I can't talk like a normal person

151
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,160
and say ups because this is a half-assed

152
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,169
DHL product placement and look how much

153
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,639
better we are than them while they

154
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,810
successfully brought packages to your

155
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,340
door they did not personally greet you

156
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,039
so stick it you pee your ass GPS then

157
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,930
can I walk over and check on him I could

158
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,400
see if anyone else's power on the way

159
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,690
she'll be fine

160
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,099
based on Beth's conversation with the

161
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,539
boyfriend from earlier their parents

162
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:44,530
wouldn't allow her to leave the house

163
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,389
when there was no blizzard now in an

164
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,860
extremely large blizzard had taken out

165
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,750
all power the phone lines and cell phone

166
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,130
communication she'll be fine

167
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,509
I know teenage horniness is a powerful

168
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,680
thing but I can't imagine it being

169
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,180
powerful enough to inspire a teenage

170
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,860
girl to go out into a blizzard with wind

171
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,030
chills powerful enough to give you

172
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,509
frostbite

173
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,830
apparently Krampus went to the same

174
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,539
fright school as that naked dude from it

175
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:02,919
follows did that's what you get for

176
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,630
being deliver racist also Krampus

177
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,889
doesn't ever actually kill anyone he

178
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,509
just takes them to hell so my question

179
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:08,979
is why did this guy get to stay in his

180
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,690
van when all the other Krampus victims

181
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,250
that we soon see get carted off to the

182
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,509
underworld feeling like you're safe

183
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:20,460
again when you actually aren't cliche

184
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,020
was that she can't help crawl this

185
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,180
jack-in-the-box thing he's in a box the

186
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,340
hell happened Daniel pg-13 whore he's

187
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,150
getting away

188
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,460
she's fine she's it turns a few problems

189
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,690
it's been over an hour and Beth's

190
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,190
parents are collectively less concerned

191
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,810
and they should be tom is clearly more

192
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,310
trusting of Derek than he should be and

193
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,449
they let their daughter go out the

194
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,099
 blizzard do you think your

195
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,360
Hummer could get through this mess

196
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,650
this asshole Howard has been complaining

197
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,090
the whole movie that Tom and Sarah are

198
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,590
rich and her assholes because of it but

199
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,479
he owns a Hummer let him out of

200
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,300
your sight for one second ooh shotgun

201
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,130
wedding shotgun wedding I thought she

202
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,210
was gonna say freeze to death in a

203
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,000
blizzard the glass is punched in then I

204
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,990
guess Krampus broke through the

205
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,610
windshield and disintegrated him because

206
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,289
the glass wouldn't be that tucked in if

207
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,219
Krampus pulled him out through the

208
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:01,780
windshield Mary used to fight over who

209
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,650
got to play sir

210
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,210
remember when movies built expositional

211
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,680
dialogue into dialogue that

212
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,300
simultaneously moved the plot forward

213
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,190
instead of just lazily throwing in some

214
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,259
lines about the past I don't I read

215
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,419
somewhere that over 350 million Rubik's

216
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,919
cubes have been sold over the years and

217
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,050
I think 175 million of them were sold to

218
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,550
be movie props

219
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,110
probably just squirrels in this weather

220
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,970
well if they're hearing sounds directly

221
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,380
above them then the squirrels probably

222
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,910
just found their way inside to keep warm

223
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,320
you know since there is a second floor

224
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,000
and an attic between them and the roof

225
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,360
right now

226
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,980
making it impossible to actually hear

227
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,419
anything happening on the roof at that

228
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,510
volume see squirrels Sara says this

229
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,430
instead of what the actual was that had

230
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,889
to be playing with their nets oumy

231
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,240
decides that she's going to sacrifice

232
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,650
her own face to see what's going on

233
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,240
inside the chimney I guess because Derek

234
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,530
family didn't have a German grandma they

235
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,060
got abducted by Krampus in record time

236
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,830
too bad we aren't following Derek's

237
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,090
family or we could be done by now

238
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,790
loosely a gas line blew you know the gas

239
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,930
lines that run up the middle of the

240
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,580
chimney and also blow directionally

241
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,990
that's one of them even though Howard's

242
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,370
legs were bitten by a monster and he was

243
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,930
pulled under the snow apparently all he

244
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,370
got out of that were some minor injuries

245
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,930
wait so Tom here's his daughter

246
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,460
screaming bloody murder and instead of

247
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,080
staying out here until he finds her he

248
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
hobbles back to his house with his

249
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,900
brother-in-law that he hates so that he

250
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,139
can bandage his flesh wound to Christmas

251
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,729
Linda pulls out her seasonal swearing

252
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,960
this time of year I'm gonna teach you

253
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,880
how to make peppermint schnapps I know

254
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,960
they're just trying to show that she's

255
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,520
unfit to be around children but there's

256
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,110
no way she's going to actually show them

257
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,490
how to make peppermint schnapps without

258
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,050
a working stove to melt some sugar and

259
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,610
peppermint to mix with a bottle of vodka

260
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,490
all right but don't you rat me out

261
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,950
underage drinking she wasn't it Derek's

262
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,570
but that doesn't mean anything yes it

263
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,490
does mean she's probably dead damn near

264
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,470
frostbite in under 4 minutes this is

265
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,180
more evidence for the Tom as a yes

266
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,680
parent for letting Beth leave column

267
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,570
back when Howard handed Tom this gun he

268
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,220
didn't give him any more ammo and when

269
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,660
Howard got attacked by the Gopher from

270
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,580
Caddyshack Tom fired up two rounds so

271
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,900
where the hell did these extra rounds

272
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,430
come from I think our best bet is to

273
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,500
stay put board up all the doors and

274
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,220
windows

275
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,630
let my daughter freeze to death but if

276
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,950
she somehow can make it back to the

277
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,150
house she'll have no way of getting in

278
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,639
it's the perfect plan look it's just I

279
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,990
almost forgot there's an unsupervised

280
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,520
baby in the house one that stayed

281
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,720
relatively quiet during this whole

282
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,610
exchange that's never a good sign if

283
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,720
you've already had a rough slightly

284
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,370
disturbing Christmas Eve the last thing

285
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,750
you need to watch are those creepy

286
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,490
rankin/bass claymation Christmas movies

287
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,260
tom has such a large quantity of scrap

288
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,490
wood lying around his house he could

289
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,780
cover up all the doors and windows with

290
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,400
it I don't think Tom has actually looked

291
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,990
through those binoculars yet or he would

292
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,460
clearly be able to see that he can't see

293
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,080
through the drapes as more of these

294
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,490
snowmen appear I'm starting to suspect

295
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,320
that Krampus is actually just Calvin

296
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,260
from Calvin and Hobbes

297
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,840
she always gets all weird on Christmas I

298
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,730
can buy her not telling her son what

299
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,170
actually happened to her family but I

300
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,580
find it hard to believe she didn't make

301
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,050
up a more feasible story that would

302
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,400
still take place around Christmastime

303
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,290
explaining her weird behavior grandma

304
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,910
who told these assholes to keep the fire

305
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,530
going trusted everyone in this horrible

306
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,270
family to do that Krampus is planned for

307
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,980
child abduction relies on them not being

308
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,570
in their bedrooms but being light

309
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,220
sleepers and downstairs within view of

310
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,790
the fireplace

311
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,710
Ruby steals its gingerbread man from

312
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,150
Trek no one else in the living room

313
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,620
wakes up during this madness the

314
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,120
Christmas tradition of putting a dead

315
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,590
highly flammable pine tree in your

316
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,150
living room that tiny-ass fire

317
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,350
extinguisher is going to put out that

318
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,260
large fire this is since I - with

319
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,000
Grandma waited for two deaths to finally

320
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,260
say something about the wonderful world

321
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,720
of Krampus Tom what's she sick are these

322
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
parents not going to go outside and see

323
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,380
what the happened to their kid just come

324
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,390
for us all grandma plays the proton game

325
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,040
in German which is somehow less fun than

326
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,310
the English pronoun game please listen o

327
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,870
me suddenly knows English well enough to

328
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,580
walk us through her backstory sis

329
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,760
Christmas vostok less cheerful and

330
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,590
snowflakes came down as if the whole

331
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,420
world was a microscope only outsource

332
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,770
for flashbacks to Tim Burton

333
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,700
it was Krampus roll credits but Krampus

334
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,600
didn't take me set night so this is the

335
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,100
story of grandma UMI's parents getting

336
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,630
pulled into the underworld because she

337
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,190
wished for it to happen my question now

338
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,350
is why is Krampus currently killing DHL

339
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,120
guys and other randoms on the street if

340
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,740
the reason he's here is because of Max

341
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,810
complaining about his family evil Santa

342
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,050
Jesus h almighty uh you did see your kid

343
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,460
get dragged up a chimney right I'm

344
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,470
hitting Howie back a little late for

345
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,120
that right you waited through the whole

346
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
story to think about going out to get

347
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,930
your son Christmas jealous ice get Nick

348
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,060
told us first tools oh he goes back to

349
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,710
exclusively German and no one is pissed

350
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,120
off about that even though she proved

351
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
that she can speak English moments

352
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
earlier how'd you guys I'm old enough to

353
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,590
know when a life is coming at you with

354
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,390
his pants down I feel like having its

355
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,920
pants down would give you the upper hand

356
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,080
or at least the upper pants even after

357
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,970
all this insane has gone down only now

358
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,770
is Linda becoming suspicious of the

359
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,330
unmarked presence that showed up less

360
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,980
than 24 hours ago you just want to get

361
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,660
these rewrapped for the kids these

362
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,280
presents survived the fire enough to

363
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,460
just require some rewrapping

364
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,330
damnit I must have slept through the

365
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,710
rest of the movie in gremlins started

366
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,660
playing wait it didn't that's just what

367
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,040
is happening in the movie someone owes

368
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,680
Spielberg an explanation Beth you up

369
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,360
there where have you been

370
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,500
I know these girls don't see their

371
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,850
cousin often and they aren't super

372
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,650
bright but any kid knows not to follow a

373
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,240
creepy voice that's clearly not your

374
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
cousin into the Attic I think all this

375
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,070
might be my fault

376
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,690
no subtitles so I can only assume she

377
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,220
said yes it's definitely your fault

378
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,360
thanks for killing all of us

379
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,190
Howard decides to leave max Oh me

380
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,350
Dorothy and a baby in the living room

381
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,700
defenseless while he goes and

382
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,440
investigates other noises because the

383
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,210
movie decided we need to congruent

384
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,010
action sequences pointing a loaded gun

385
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,600
with your finger on the trigger around a

386
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,500
room that might contain you're

387
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,210
frightened hiding nieces this thing is

388
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,620
definitely terrifying but what are all

389
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,060
these teeth for if it's swallows kids

390
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,470
hole I'm sure this is just a funny joke

391
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,940
and I laughed at it like a moron but

392
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,200
this asshole bothers to wipe his chin

393
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,090
after a meal movie ignores two

394
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,770
fundamental facts about nail guns they

395
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,750
require compressed air and the nose must

396
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,640
be pushed in for it to fire convenient

397
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,020
giant wood cutting board is convenient

398
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,910
excessive licking also demon baby

399
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,380
frenching even though this robot is

400
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,060
stabbing Tom multiple times in the back

401
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,740
Tom will continue on like he didn't get

402
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,130
stabbed multiple times in the back

403
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,080
penis ex machina also Howard's dog is

404
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,550
able to approach and eat the last

405
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,320
gingerbread man hardly making a sound

406
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,090
this doll size creature is able to hang

407
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,830
a full-sized human woman with the power

408
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,840
of flight and Christmas lights that bear

409
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,580
is an extremely ineffective minion that

410
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,320
jack-in-the-box can eat a whole person

411
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,670
the owl doll can get created with

412
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,110
Christmas lights and all the damn bear

413
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,700
can do is barely fight Linda's arm

414
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,080
instead of sneaking up on der clown with

415
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
the axe Linda decides to let it know

416
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,110
she's coming up behind it giving it time

417
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,950
to get away don't get him girl kit

418
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,720
assumes after hours of ass-kicking from

419
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,760
Krampus that this dog who is now dead by

420
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,250
the way will make a difference

421
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,600
evildoer clown jack-in-a-box makes in

422
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,850
that school sound get and Rosie will be

423
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,500
waste time on an invisible fight between

424
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,450
der clown and der dog der clown

425
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,980
inexplicably waits to do anything to

426
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,180
these people while they all try to

427
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,950
remove the al doll movie suddenly got a

428
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,450
troll to vibe that I'm sure is an

429
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,280
accident when everyone is sorry that we

430
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,480
need to make a break for it

431
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
well don't run too fast you might get a

432
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,120
crevasse not only does Krampus have evil

433
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,920
powers that cause power to sort of come

434
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,630
back but he also has ironic powers

435
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,160
because up on the housetop starts

436
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,130
playing can't you just go through the

437
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,960
big gaping hole at the elves made when

438
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,950
they crash through the front window

439
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,140
don't wind up oh sure now you think

440
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,910
about it but now your kid is gonna stop

441
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,200
you from going in there because you're

442
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,100
too slow to think of it

443
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,420
Krampus continues coming down the

444
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,890
chimney even though he certainly knows

445
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,360
all the people he wants to kill just

446
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,070
left well I guess grandma did her duty

447
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,660
as a distraction but I still can't

448
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,710
figure out why this asshole even

449
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,450
bothered with her movie realizes it

450
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,710
didn't kill off characters fast enough

451
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,090
during the duration of the movie so it

452
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,380
spends the last 10 minutes killing

453
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,760
everyone else without them putting up a

454
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,830
fight winter tremors Tom shoots the

455
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,390
gopher demon with his new shotgun that

456
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,280
suddenly has infinite shotgun shells the

457
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,870
snowplow isn't covered in feet of snow

458
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,460
and it knew you could just make

459
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,840
characters you wanted to kill off just

460
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,280
vanish into the ground I could have made

461
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,660
a successful career writing horror

462
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,100
movies you don't have to be creative

463
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,290
yeah yeah it's a car won't start cliche

464
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,850
but I'm wondering how this kid manages

465
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,620
to reach the gas pedals this kid is also

466
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,090
fluent in German and he's an asshole

467
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,440
so I don't know where he finds all the

468
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,590
time to know this you don't even know

469
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,090
how to drive a car you're 10

470
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,190
wait does the ripoff of trimmers kill

471
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,890
Krampus his henchmen do littering why

472
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,300
are any of them still there they did

473
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,650
what they came to do maybe the

474
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,760
screenwriter convince him to stay

475
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,380
because max wanted to renege on his deal

476
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,540
that's racist at first I thought Krampus

477
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,340
was a principal demon punishing kids who

478
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,930
were bad and forgot what it meant to

479
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,400
have Christmas spirit yeah his methods

480
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,630
are a little extreme but he had a

481
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,460
purpose now that max has clearly learned

482
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,810
his lesson and Krampus just throws him

483
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,950
into hell anyway I'm starting to think

484
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,150
he's no better than an internet troll

485
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,010
you know who you are it was all a dream

486
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,900
or was it cliche they all seemed pretty

487
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,460
pumped but if my version of Helen was

488
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,510
getting to spend a nice Christmas

489
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,010
morning with my family inside of a snow

490
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,720
globe I'd probably take it got a hand

491
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,100
into this movie for an ending that makes

492
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,480
you think it was all a dream then pulls

493
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,040
back and makes you realize it's not only

494
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,810
real but it's got a pretty poetic kind

495
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,370
of ending they're all just in that snow

496
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,990
globe forever and ever I like that

497
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,980
ending it's not

498
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,570
gotta say though this is a lot of

499
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,710
missing people happening around

500
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,820
Christmas that no one ever asks

501
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,260
questions about feels like Krampus would

502
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,880
be more of a known evil entity if he's

503
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,290
got so many families trapped in snow

504
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,210
globes all the creatures show up for one

505
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,830
last lunch at the camera for some reason

506
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,900
I guess they see the unseen audience but

507
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,250
two Krampus this has to be pretty

508
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,140
unusual behavior to see his minions just

509
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:57,470
lunge toward something for no reason

510
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,920
buzz what could Andy possibly get that

511
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:14,160
is worse than you

512
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,310
as for Nicodemus they must move your

513
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,410
house to the of the stone that's why you

514
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:30,980
always leave a note

515
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,840
but now you know there was a man named

516
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,670
Jack Dawson and that he saved me I don't

517
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,180
even have a picture of him he exists now

518
00:15:42,180 --> 00:16:05,000
only in my memory Oh baby
