1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:12,960
this is going to be a comprehensive

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,119
review of this $1500 electric skateboard

3
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,080
versus this four hundred and forty nine

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:39,300
dollar skateboard let's begin by

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:01:01,260
comparing Hardware before I go outside

6
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,359
for some practical tests of these boards

7
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,409
I just want to go over some of the

8
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,479
technical specifications looking at

9
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
their websites they're super super

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,590
similar so the two sport says it goes 20

11
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,490
miles an hour

12
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,500
boosted board says it goes 22 miles an

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,210
hour this thing says has a seven mile

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,400
range boosted says it has a six or seven

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,770
mile range regenerative braking dual

16
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,159
motors regenerative braking dual motors

17
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,259
honestly even the juice website looks

18
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,119
like the boosted board website but for

19
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,640
like a side-by-side spec analysis they

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,159
seem to be very or lease advertised as

21
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,680
very very similar I did want to do a

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,300
flex test

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,659
[Music]

24
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,310
all right this is the Flex test on the

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,640
$1500 boosted board 100% bamboo deck

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,659
look at that flex flex

27
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,670
and this is the Flex Omni um it's

28
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,000
actually for 49 is for the cheap one

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,290
599's for the dual motor version of the

30
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,240
juice so I take that but I said this is

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,060
a five hundred and $99 board not at $499

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,130
board all right this is the Flex test on

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:19,060
the bamboo and maple juice board exactly

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,090
not that bad and you can't flex as much

35
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,920
that hits this battery and it's it does

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,870
feel more rigid but it flexes a lot more

37
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,040
than I had expected it to

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,519
so what Sam go outside now right yell to

39
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,590
it okay let's joy

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,319
I'm gonna have Sam carry the extra board

41
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,930
because well he offered to and you're

42
00:02:40,930 --> 00:03:03,129
cool that alright yeah it's alright

43
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,870
if you're wondering why we're carrying

44
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,470
the juice board it's cause like I want

45
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,640
to ride it for the first time on camera

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,260
and in New York City we got to make sure

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,420
we're somewhere we can like ride safely

48
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,060
where there's not too many people we're

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,310
going to carry it to a safe less crowded

50
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:26,850
part of the city test it there

51
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,460
all right so now we're deep deep on

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,230
Manhattan's West Side there's like some

53
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,640
thuggish looking dudes over there that

54
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,320
are smoking pot I'm not going to film

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,420
them they look a little scary over here

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,280
we've got the ups fulfillment center

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,640
this is a good place to test the board

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,770
that is a guy's smoking pot all right

59
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,600
this is it this is the first powering up

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,080
of the juice board

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,280
great turn on fine no problem

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,069
all right

63
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:59,810
well I'll tell you this much it's a lot

64
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,180
quieter than the boosted board start off

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,540
with the speed test yeah acceleration

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,000
test yeah

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,810
a very important detail here NYPD this

68
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,450
is chalk and washes away with water this

69
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,549
is not vandalism because it's temporary

70
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,230
please don't show up to my house or

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,670
office and we're trying to arrest me

72
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,580
again

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,289
okay that's going to be our starting

74
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:27,150
line there

75
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,500
[Music]

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,819
I'm on the juice board

77
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,600
that's the boosted board ready yep one

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,409
two three

79
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:51,210
okay well this is the initial ride of

80
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,560
the juice board and acceleration not

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:10,700
great

82
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:24,570
[Music]

83
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,040
would that look like in your perspective

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,080
I didn't even see it you were gone in

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,450
half a second

86
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,860
all right next test is going to be the

87
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,200
high speed to the top speed test how do

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,150
we even do this I'm gonna go as fast as

89
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,520
I can say I'm gonna try and keep up now

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm on the juice board I'm on the cheap

91
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,360
board the $449 board so that's been 10

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,840
seconds this is probably top speed come

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,360
on man when it comes to top speed test

94
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,810
again the juice board was absolutely

95
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,630
creamed by the boosted board now this

96
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,070
next test this is going to be the

97
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,160
braking test how quickly they stopped my

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,810
chalk line which is right here which is

99
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,730
washable chalk not vandalism remember

100
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,100
that it's not vandalism this chalk line

101
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,540
right here we're going to start all the

102
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,340
way down there at that truck come full

103
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,380
speed to the line here and then hit the

104
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,450
brakes as soon as we hit this line and

105
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,670
see how far past the line we go before

106
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:24,250
we stop three two go

107
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,750
all right so we did that test five times

108
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,110
and quite frankly the brakes on this

109
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,510
aren't that bad like Busan weren't

110
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,700
definitely stopped so windy stop more

111
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,250
aggressively and more effectively but

112
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,650
it's not like the acceleration test like

113
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,350
I would say that stops in about 15 feet

114
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,590
of less distance than this stops kind of

115
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,340
amazing this kid just came up on a Busan

116
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,850
word yeah what's your name Casey how

117
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,110
long have you been riding your booster

118
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,990
board I had it since day one try out

119
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,600
this juice board just like take it up

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,890
and down the street let me know your

121
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,200
honest thoughts compared to the boosted

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,420
board all right cool all right so this

123
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,110
is the unbiased stranger we met in the

124
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,450
street who's a veteran boosted board

125
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:23,930
rider test I think that like what's the

126
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,040
rest what about the booster for you can

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,440
go on reverse this you can't really do

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,230
that anything like getting on like those

129
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,150
little edges when you're turning the

130
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,560
boost is just like super smooth like

131
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
this I feel like I kind of like

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,140
out of it I drift a little bit the

133
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,450
verdict here is that I would say that

134
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,190
screw support is better but I would say

135
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,430
it I'm bad for you don't think it's bad

136
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,730
okay thank you for your help

137
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,770
nice to meet you

138
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,659
and you sir I promised him I'd buy him

139
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,400
the smoothie help me with this video

140
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,069
fair trade all right so the conclusion

141
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,699
from the tests in the real world is that

142
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,830
it's not as bad as I expected

143
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,930
but it's nowhere near as good as this

144
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,370
but for 500 bucks you're getting a

145
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,650
pretty good for this isn't garbage it's

146
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,690
not garbage I would not call it pretty

147
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,960
good though

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,580
in conclusion this thing works it's fine

149
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,800
I guess it is impressive that they're

150
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,780
able to do it for such a low price but

151
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,479
just know one thing this is not a

152
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,880
boosted board this is a cheap knockoff

153
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,130
of a boosted board this this is a toy

154
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,959
and if you're fine buying a toy then

155
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,969
it's a good value for a toy but it's a

156
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:38,959
little bit like wanting a

157
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,760
high-performance sports car like wanting

158
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,620
a Ferrari boosted board being the

159
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,390
Ferrari instead of getting a Ferrari you

160
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,610
get a used old Hyundai used old

161
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,380
Hyundai's fine I might even get you from

162
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,540
A to B but if you want a hybrid if you

163
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,380
want a Ferrari

164
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,529
don't buy a Hyundai and then paint a

165
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:57,170
dramatically similar logo to the Ferrari
