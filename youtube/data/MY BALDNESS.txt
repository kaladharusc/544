21
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:27,650
what a press embargo is in journalism and public relations a present Bargo is

22
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,750
a request by a source that the news provided is not published until a

23
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,650
certain date you know something but you can't talk about it okay

24
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,420
in this box is this totally in this box is something totally new

25
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,040
it's a drone and it's the it's the latest and greatest you supposed to put

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,200
in your pocket got a 4k camera

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,410
I'm not allowed to talk about it we're open that but well I guess I could open

28
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,060
the box i couldn't show you until october $YEAR 18 so far this press

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,799
embargo sucks

30
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:08,510
in other news my airplane seat movie it's about to cross 20 million views 20

31
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,370
million that's insane

32
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:18,680
nobody has been up for seven days 20 million views in seven days

33
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,060
that's like five million views a day I know it's not final but that also means

34
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,340
which is not is that is now the second most watched movie of all the 650 videos

35
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,579
or whatever on my youtube channel so i want to take one second and talk about

36
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,299
viral videos so i have touched on this before in this channel but it's a

37
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,950
popular subject especially relevant since I just had like a wild viral video

38
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:47,120
viral videos viral videos are almost impossible to predict their greens about

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,639
the shot watch already watched sumo green writing the eyeball boom dad viral

40
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,040
videos are almost impossible to manufacture to actually create now the

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,189
flip side of that is that nothing can do for a youtube channel

42
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,150
what a viral video can do for youtube channel bike lanes which was like my

43
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,620
first really viral video on this channel it blew my channel up in the seven days

44
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,070
in several East this 20 million view banger i've got almost a half a million

45
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,470
new subscribers viral videos are hugely powerful and that's why people are is

46
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,090
pursuing them all right why did this one go viral pouring it into this and say

47
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,770
this is why I think this particular video went viral not a recipe for viral

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,990
videos in general abroad abbreviated examination of y21 thousand-dollar

49
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,990
first-class airplane seat went viral number-one zeitgeist right now like this

50
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,190
idea of opulence and indulgence and over-the-top miss creates a climate

51
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,150
where a title that says 21 thousand-dollar airplane seat that's

52
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,110
interesting . compelling what kind of a world we live in where a one-way

53
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,310
airplane seat cost twice as much as the worldwide median household income timing

54
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,229
there's a lot of bad news right now there's this us election which is a mess

55
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,250
there's the conflicts taking place in the Middle East in Syria there's global

56
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,090
terrorism there's Isis there's all these just terrible things dominating the news

57
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,280
cycle and when something fun and harmless and playful and interesting and

58
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
sort of newsworthy pops up everybody just jumped on it

59
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,229
general this is something like a fancy airplane t the whole world is interested

60
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,539
in this was written about in south korea and easy and in and in New Zealand it

61
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,479
was written about in Canada it was written about in Saudi Arabia this

62
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,130
stupid story about the airplane seat was general and up to appeal to most of the

63
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,520
world which is a nice segue into the last factor in oculus it was perfectly

64
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,990
innocuous there was nothing offensive or harmful or bad about that video at all

65
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,190
which when it was safe for all the press outlets and soccer moms that posted on

66
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,880
Facebook and shared over there no swear words there's nothing gross there's

67
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,510
nothing yucky there is nothing offensive about that too

68
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,410
anyone when you combine all those factors would like a little bit of funny

69
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,760
and interesting well-told story and then a lot of bit of luck

70
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
that's how that viral video came to be

71
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,800
yeah

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:32,830
what about her feel good being pregnant

73
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,740
if you doing the whole foods now

74
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,770
groceries are expensive tonight here in the united states of america is the

75
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,960
first-ever presidential election

76
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,500
no first-ever what would i say first-ever first to me is the first

77
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,080
presidential debate where they have the Republican nominee in the Democratic

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,780
nominee and then they battle to the death

79
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,289
we are having a debate party at our house although it's not much of a party

80
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:04,530
because we only invited five friends one of whom is pregnant so it's sort of like

81
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,639
we have six friends are going to grocery shopping now it's nice birthday we have

82

yeah

84
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:22,430
the debate is at nine o'clock which I think it's too late for dinner

85
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:28,339
I think people are going to be expecting snacks canvas but Candace thinks

86
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,779
everybody's gonna want dinner

87
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,499

93
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:14,089
that big TV that's been sitting in the corner of my office will have a TV here

94
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:15,050
at home

95
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,439
I mean there's one in the bedroom would have a TV here that's the debate TV

96
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,719
gotta get set up

97
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm just gonna put it on the floor you know Roy me

98
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:56,959
oh wow I got out of the box but not together got a TV set up feel pretty

99
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,649
good about it or not to get the cable all the way out here coming up from the

100
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,209
bedroom

101
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:08,209
alright didn't work out the cable box doesn't work in the living room

102
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,240
I was trying to run it from the bedroom but the cable wasn't long enough i'm

103
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,170
trying to go to the store and out the debate starts in like 20 minutes plus

104
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,170
what's the likelihood of the stores gonna be open

105
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,460
what I need is like a 60-foot long hdmi

106
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:43,850
extension cord cable but are they don't see them maybe I can take the cable from

107
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,730
the better the cable from the other bedroom connect them together with this

108
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,030
cable run that from the one bedroom living room it's only about God they

109
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,610
don't have a long hdmi cable here I really crappy part 40 words with nine

110
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,290
minutes to spare

111
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:16,399
birthday to you have babies asleep to the birth the you already get it or not
