1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,100
Every. Single. Day.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,520
I have to put up with so much abuse. And mean comments from you guys.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,380
It's always like I'm the end of the joke. I'm the always the butt of the joke not no no not today

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,980
That's right. I'm going to roast you guys. I've been collecting

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,060
comments secretly for the past couple of weeks

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,320
and then I picked the ones that are make you guys seem the dumbest so now we're going to read them as I

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,680
&quot;Pewds, you are so mature about everything except when it comes to PUBG and fortnite

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,400
Seriously, cut that childish &quot;hate fortnite because I play PUBG&quot; act

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,880
and act rationally. Think about it. You hate this game because it's a copy of PUBG, but in reality IT'S NOT

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
Fornite hasawholeotheraspect to it

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,560
which is brhghgbr

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,800
Pathetic

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,380
This is basically all my comments. There's a bunch of kids. You're all lowlife losers

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,910
You know that right? have you ever seen a vagana? (respek wahmen pls)

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,610
I don't think so. Cuz otherwise you wouldn't argue about fortnite, and why it's better than PUBG. You pathetic losers (roasted)

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:15,520
What are you gonna do? Dislike the video, is that what you're gonna? Please don't x3 I'm joking I'm jokiinnggg

Hurts now doesn't it hurts to be on the other side. That's right

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,240
That's the point of this video. &quot;Hey the fact that Drake can figure out

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,700
&quot;Fortnight&quot;

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,000
Is amazing frankly I would be amazed if he tied his own shoes and looky loo. He turned on a TV

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,090
Navigating the menus and using a controller and everything you go little buddy good for you.&quot; Okay, that was actually a funny comment

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,540
I love this cuz it really just shows like why does anyone care the fact that Drake played Fortnite

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,600
Who gives a *oof*? &quot;This channel is getting worse and worse like if you agree.&quot;

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,940
ZERO LIIKESS

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,900
GOTTEM AHAHAHAHA

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, that's right. Hey Mr. Tryhard sucks, like this video if you agree. Ha, that's right mr.

32

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,960
&quot;This guy is gay.&quot; No u

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,220
*wheezes in laughter*

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,880
*meme review*

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,140
&quot;This was so boring, but I watched it because Iove you&quot;

38
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,040
That was backhand compliment I have ever seen in my life

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,400
Actually this is how I want all my fans to be just as dedicated as possible okay (k)

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,820
&quot;My Gah, three ads on a PewDiePie video, I thought I'd never see the day&quot;

41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,580
le sigh

42
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,200
Hey, it hurts. These comments are the ones that actually truly hurt

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,200
&quot;Drake isn't a rapper. He's an R&amp;B singer that can rap really really well

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,580
He has only made one rap album. IYARTITL and that album is not an album

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,560
It was a half random mixtape made in two weeks, but when Drake raps he ain't soft

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,460
He has made some of the hardest rap songs this decade.&quot;

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,060
What're you saying

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,459
Pathetic. If you think Drake goes hard, That's like saying PewDiePie is funny. I can't even help myself

49
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,459
I just have to be the end of joke that's- this it's part of my DNA my

50
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,579
My Swedish cuccness can't allow anything else. &quot;I drove past your house the other day

51
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,560
I didn't even mean to I went the wrong way.&quot;

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,440
Why did you tell me this first of all I have a lot of questions with this number one

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,400
Why did you think I would see this comment I literally gets thousands of them every single day

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,920
Second of all how do you know where I live?

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,880
Third of all what do you mean you went the wrong way?

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,060
And what do you think it matters to me that you went the wrong way?

57
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,280
What is this comment? It annoys the hell out of me

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,140
&quot;To be honest about depression

59
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,140
Yes, it's all up to you. I have a lot of

60
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,400
expperr-

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,640
Expirience with depression and trust me if you want to be depressed and sad you will it's all up to you.&quot; I definitely trust

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,940
experience from

63
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,980
Anyone that doesn't know how to spell it

64

Expirience and have a Markiplier thumbnaiihh

65

66
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,760
My audience is filled with a bunch of low-level morons, and if you are reading this comment Markimoo youtubepoop

67
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,220
I want you to know that you are a moron you're an idiot

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,100
And I don't like you why am I so mean for no reason? I'm kidding of course

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,790
You're great do your thing &quot;I just want to say I really like post breakdown PewDiePie, you managed to become insanely

70
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,409
Self-aware and sort of toxic in a funny way pointing out idiotic bullshit online I also absolute

71
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,880
Love your low-quality visual effects good job. Good job Brad inside

78
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm glad and then you had the comment right underneath it

79
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,920
&quot;Still better than BBC&quot;

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,780
97 people thought that was such a good comment that they would thumb it up

81
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,560

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,780
Everything is going to *oof* and it looks like there are going to be many migrations 8chan and wizchan.&quot;

92
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,980
I made the video about green text, and I clearly reference reddit and nothing else, but yeah

93
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,120

97
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,420
Why?

98
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,960
Why did you come to this conclusion?

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,470
What made you think this was confirmed in your head?

100
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,370
I don't know why these things are annoy me so much like what made you think to come up with this comment?

101
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,560
What was the thought process and why did six people thumb it up?

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,980
Don't understand you guys.

103
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,740
&quot;I feel like he's trying so hard to be funny sometimes. It's kind of sad

104
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,220
Oh how the mighty have fallen.&quot;

105
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,350
What're you saying? You even edited this comment of course I try to be funny. That's the point of my videos

106
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,209
That's what I do every single day if you think I've been trying to be funny now

107
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:54,200
Just watch my old videos and literally pause sometimes and go &quot;oh uh let me think of a joke here&quot;

108
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,920
*thinking pewds*

I read these comments. I'm like. What are you trying to say?

110
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,400
What made you come up to this idea?

121
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,720
God damn it. (nice job)

122

&quot;I'm glad that Felix is getting sponsors again.&quot; Well. That's a nice comment actually

123

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
Pathetic. You guys just like to complain about everything don't you

132
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,020
&quot;You just April fooled everyone&quot; This video was published March 30th

133
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,840
This is the thing that happens all the time with comments just because you watched it during April Fool's

134
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,760
Doesn't *burp* Doesn't mean it was published

135
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,660
It's the same thing when I did Fridays with PewDiePie back in the day and people would watch it on the Sunday and they'd be like

136
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,160
&quot;I'm not even watching it on a friday leepictroll hehehe&quot;

&quot;I was thinking why so low FPS he is millionaire&quot;

140
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,270
That's right everyone, the more money you have the more- the better- the more frame rates

141
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:01,120
That's just a scale that works for everyone. I was reacting to videos dipshit. It's not my gameplay

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
Thank you Edgar

143

145
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,320
Yes, you are and you did have you heard of comments? Have you heard of sentence building? No?

146
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,740
I don't think so huh. Yes, you pussy ass *oof*

147
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:27,060
You guys are just friking fricks. I don't appreciate these comments. You are clearly doing it for attention

148
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,210
What do you mean I ruins YouTube it's called ruined dummy

149
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,480
&quot;Hahahahaha&quot; There hear it is. &quot;Haahahahaaha I'm watching this on Sunday.&quot; No one cares. No one cares

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't care when you're watching it. It's none of my concern

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,990
I'll put it on the right day so annoying &quot;I had a dream about you last night Felix quite magical

152
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,330
I met you I asked if you could drive me home it took five minutes

153
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,960
You did and I said, thanks and left it was truly magnificent

154
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Thanks Pewds.&quot; Keep me out of your weird fetish fantasies. Please. I don't need to hear about this what the heck what?

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,780
646

156
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,160
405

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,540
703

158
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,300
724 good job Brad, what does this mean the big Campbell?

159
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,720
Great good job. Good job Brad. &quot;What do we have here another re-upload&quot;

160
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,930
That's right everybody, all my videos are just re-uploads of reuploads of reuploads. There's no original content anymore

161
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:32,340
I'm just re-uploading the video I did now eight years ago. That's right. I made this video eight years ago. You're welcome

162
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,100
&quot;What's that in the right bottom corner at 5:49&quot;

163
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,400
549

164
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
DAMNIITTT (hey we liked to have fun on this channel)

165
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,420
All right for real though, I'd really enjoyed reading the comments it's something that I've always really really enjoyed

166
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,500
I think the day I stopped reading the comments is probably the day that I should end YouTube because

167
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,950
The interaction that I get between you guys is what I enjoy the most

168
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,820
I know it's like a meme that I steal your contnetr or whatever, but I to me

169
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,490
It's more like we have a community, and I'm just justifying stealing but with the comments

170
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,920
I I genuinely enjoyed it and seeing when you guys laugh at stuff that you thought were funny or

171
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,809
Leaving a nice comment, or bad. I still really enjoy reading it, and I enjoy especially laughing at these dumb ones

172
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,800
I definitely noticed a huge shift from the last six months

173
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,730
Way more positive comments people are it seem like you guys are really enjoying the videos, and I'm having a blast making them

174
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,220
I think for the first time like I finally actually figured out how to make videos because I have weekly series

175
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,040
And I just makes my life so much easier and so much more enjoyable

176
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,120
I know it's like a meme that I'm just stealing content, but

177
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,600
If that's the case I'll take it because I'm having a blast and it seems like you guys are enjoying as well

178
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,180
So keep up the great work everybody

179
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,320
That being said

180
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,970
I amm actually going away. I'm going

181
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:03,170
To travel so I don't know if there will be some weird gap in between the videos. Hopefully not but

182
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,760
That's just my announcement saying that that being said I'll see you guys next time. I'm just uhhh

183
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,320
I don't know when I'll be back. I don't know anything, but I will be back at some point

184
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,460
uuhm

185
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,140
in the fu-

186
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:27,100
In the future, so have a good one. I see you, goodbye :( goodbye

187
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,220
Everybody

188
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,000
