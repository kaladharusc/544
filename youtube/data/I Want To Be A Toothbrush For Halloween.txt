00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,970
why are you laughs you think this is

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:33,810
funny

5
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,040
come this way

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,129
it's like going this way

7
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,190
behold Beach I'm gonna be a toothbrush

8
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,739
hey what's up you guys welcome back to

9
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,929
my channel where I can't put on a strip

10
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,359
lash because my lashes are two perms and

11
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,370
it's too curly can't get him in there

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,050
there were many a days when I was

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,199
younger for Halloween I love to partake

14
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,900
and a half nakedness and the cute

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,720
but like nowadays I'm like a 32 year old

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,430
lady and my favorite thing to do at

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,920
Halloween is to sit my ass outside and

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,680
hand out candy and my favorite material

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,990
to work with is foam because it really

20
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,720
gives you that like I'm in a costume

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,270
look a couple years ago I was a lion's

22
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,579
mane so I cut out a piece of foam like

23
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,229
the shape of Maine and drew a lion's

24
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:32,320
face on it was not a big hit no one

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,689
understood what it was it was the state

26
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,939
of Maine I drew all the cities and I was

27
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,159
upset and hurt I've also always wanted

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,020
to be a tooth brush I don't know why I

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,909
just want to be a tooth brush I just

30
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,920
feel like it's the perfect costume it's

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,950
like just mundane enough to be like yes

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,289
and I want something this year that the

33
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,820
kids are gonna understand and at least

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,469
appreciate you know what I'm saying

35
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,049
where I want the bristles is completely

36
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,180
around my face I don't want the

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,950
toothbrush head to be up here or down

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,590
here I want it to be my face so I'm

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,950
gonna be in the bristles then the body's

40
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,330
in the uniform which is wearing all

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,400
black so I'm gonna do like a thin strip

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
sort of shaped like a toothbrush

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,370
hopefully but the bristles of the

44
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,140
toothbrush I went through a couple of

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,520
ideas maybe you PI clean

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,990
I don't know what's gonna work what's

47
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,760
gonna stay out straight so what I laid

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,220
it on with straws now I know that straws

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,900
can be a little problematic but don't

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,670
worry they're not going into the ocean

51
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,320
in the garbage they're going up to my

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,750
face so that's my plan welcome to me

53
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,940
making my halloween costumes so that I

54
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,800
could entertain the children when they

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,360
come trick-or-treating and they'll go

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
trick or treat

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,660
and I go trick Beach and then I do

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,320
something real messed up you know

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,610
whatever happened to the trick part of

60
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,300
trick-or-treating

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,530
I'm gonna need that marker you wouldn't

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,120
be a toothbrush to where you upset

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,130
everyone but I need the head to be

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,140
pretty wide like how wide do you think

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,060
the toothbrush heads should be will you

66
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,130
sketch me just gets me like one of your

67
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,820
french boys wait wait wait I want to be

68
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,310
a big tooth brush a really big one with

69
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,080
good bristles like that

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,150
oh no it's too thick with 2 C's ok this

71
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:31,390
is gonna take me so long what does it

72
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,540
look like my dream it's like too long so

73
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,280
we're gonna fix it cuz it's a little too

74
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,260
big for me but I like the shape and I

75
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,300
think that it's nice this make up

76
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,940
splotch that's where my chin is do you

77
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,440
think that that's good I'm short as how

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm short each it looks like a spatula

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,390
let's go to face all so the trick with

80
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,280
foam and face holes is that you should

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,470
always cut it too small and then you Jam

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,640
your head through it you know what I

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,110
mean it should be like the size of your

84
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,390
face not your head and then you go like

85
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,310
that good my face was here yeah this is

86
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,510
my chin I call it toothbrush bhaijan

87
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:23,100
give me that Julie

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,080
are you creating a sad portrait of a

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
middle-aged lady in her home alone

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,940
making herself a toothbrush Gustav how

91
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,669
dare you this is thick foam that I got

92
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,290
you can do it with much thinner foam

93
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,300
than this but I wanted the straws to

94
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,580
have a good base to stick out from you

95
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,010
know that was my logic and I have

96
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:49,419
flawless logic as a Virgo oh my god

97
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,340
throw me a bitch oh it's gonna need to

98

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,419
my eyebrows there needs to be a little

100
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,550

115
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,030

are you ready to do some bristles I'm

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,630
gonna use this piece of scrap foam my

127
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,570
idea was to cut like a hole in the foam

128
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,290
and then take like a good sized portion

129
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,530
of the straw take a rubber band we go

130
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,160
like this that looks good yeah does that

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:16,960
look like a toothbrush tons mi times of

132
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,570
bristles I want to be the bristle es

133
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,210
brush you've ever seen so there should

134
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,760
be like 1 2 3 or up top you think so

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,670
we've marked off I think where my

136
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,040
bristles are gonna go and then we're

137
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,840
gonna start getting straws ready to jam

138
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,940
them in there I'm gathering all my

139
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,310
bunches of toothbrush bristles while

140
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,710
also trying to do a mathematical problem

141
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,010
about how many bunches of straws I have

142
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,650
and how many I need to go in the holes

143
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,320
it's a lot of math so I just stopped

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,750
