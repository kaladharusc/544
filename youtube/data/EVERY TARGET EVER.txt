1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,700
I can't believe you're wearing a red shirt in a Target.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,260
Why would that be a problem?

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,540
Hi! Excuse me. I'm looking for the cat toys?

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,880
Oh, ma'am I don't actually work here.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,060
Hi, do you know how much this is? Because there's no price on it.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,240
No, sorry. I'm not um...

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Oh, excuse me. Maybe you can help them out.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,080
Can I get next Friday off?

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,780
What?

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,440
Yeah, cause I gotta go to my grandma's funeral. I missed it last time...

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,680
...so I really wanna make it this time....

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,660
Ok! You know what? Fine! Fine, cats are on the second floor next to automotive. Uh that is

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,280
29.95, and yeah you can have Friday off, if you get your shift covered.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,420
Hella.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,700
That was intense.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,320
Yeah.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,320
By the way, do you know when the pharmacy closes?

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,100
I don't actually work here dips***.

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,840
I know that piss nuts. You're blocking the sign.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,920
Oh...

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,880
Every Target Ever -_-

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,600
Yeah, but why do you need more than one set of placemats? It's all kind of the same purpose.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
I'll get us a cart.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,440
Whoa, babe, you don't need to get us a cart we're only getting, like two things.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,920
Okay...

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,840
Umm, babe, are you sure you don't need a cart?

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,620
My arms are already, like, super full Vanessa! How do you expect me to carry a goddamn cart!?

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,900
I'm gonna need, like, four carts.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,400
All right, so we only have half an hour so we cannot get distracted this time.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright, got it. I'll get the cleaning supplies, you get the new sheets.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,180
Alright. Meet back here in 10 minutes.

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,740
Got it!

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,160
Ooh!

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,740
We are definitely gonna need one of these.

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,020
How many clothes are you taking into the dressing room?

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,220
Fifty-five.

37
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,260
Let's start your training off in the shoe department.

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,240
Okay, so first, start by taking some random boxes and throwing them on the ground.

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,440
Then do a little mixing and matching. Put two right shoes into one box. You know put one shoe into a bunch of boxes.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,140
Hell you can even throw a t-shirt or a hat into the mix. Any questions?

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,280
So what if someone asks where a specific shoe is?

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,200
Just say you're wearing a red shirt and don't actually work here.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,820
Got it!

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,560
I always wanted a place where I could get a hamper and a fresh banana at the same place!

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,500
Ok, and you're all set!

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:28,300
Thank you very much. Uh, hey, whatever happened to that dog that used to be your mascot?

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,940
Oh God! What kind of monster paints a target on a dog's face and lets it run through an NRA convention?

48
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,500
Paddles!!

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,020
Clear!!

50
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,660
I don't know you're talking about. Take care though!

51
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,080
Why are the pet's toys next to the tires?

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Alright! Give me smiles! You're getting great deals and you're happy.

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,459
Ugh, it's too happy! Okay...

54
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,369
...uh, oh you uh work at a homeless shelter, and it's kind of sad because everybody's like poor and homeless they stink.

55
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:06,880
But you're super proud of yourself for being a nice person! Oh...

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
Aw, yeah!

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,030
Okay, yeah, yeah, we're getting there, we're getting there.

58
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,989
Okay, so uh all right, so now you've just got a puppy, and he's super cute,

59
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:21,580
but he just took a diarrhea dump in your shoe! But he tried to clean it up so, super sweet!

60
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,560
Yep, yep all right, now...

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,040
...give me a jump.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,500
Oh, that's perfect! We're gonna sell so many undershirts.

63
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,860
Honestly, I haven't gotten a bra anywhere else.

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:52,780
Aw, this shirt is awesome. I'm gonna look so cool at school tomorrow!

65
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,440
Damn it!

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,400
They only have 30 Star Wars shirts here!?

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Do you have a Target card, miss?

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,220
Oh, actually, yeah.

69
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,500
My name is Alex, by the way.

70
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,800
Okay.

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
You know?

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,380
Alex,

73
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,780
from Target.

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,520
Okay.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,020
You don't recognize me?

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,540
Nope, sorry.

77
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,400
Oh, um, I was a meme. I was even on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,020
Seriously, you don't recognize me at all? Nothing?

79
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,800
No. I really don't.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,160
Okay. Paper or plastic?

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,400
Target doesn't do paper bags.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,080
Oh, right, right.

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,580
Seriously you're not getting anything? Okay, I'm just. I'm Alex from Target.

84
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,080
Every

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,660
Every Target

86
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,340
Every Target Ever

87
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,280
Hi, it's Courtney. Thanks for watching this video about Target!!!

88
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,860
