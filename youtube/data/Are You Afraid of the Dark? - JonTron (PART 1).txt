35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,920
of the dark was the Nickelodeon produced

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Canadian made kids take on horror

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
anthology shows such as twilight zone

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,710
and Tales from the Crypt okay still

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,300
can't do the Crypt Keeper it's pretty

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,310
much the same concept as goosebumps but

41
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,900
I always thought this show was a lot

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,180
scarier not to mention it aired four

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,250
years earlier like holy hell okay this

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,260
intro is an SF K is not safe for kids

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,450
this show touched all bases vampire

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,300
neighbors ghost neighbors neighbors a

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,590
lot of the episodes had at least one

48
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,660
neighbor the episode that still haunts

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,489
me to this day and I mean this was the

50
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,830
tale of the dead man's float the one

51
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,269
with like the zombies skeleton who would

52
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:40,830
pull you down if you went swimming and

53
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,390
drown you I mean they Dennison look at

54
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,340
this look at this they showed this to

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,030
kids the horrors knew no bounds except

56
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,620
for murder of course these can't murder

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,540
kids on television but you can in movies

58
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,680
I want another twist

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
well you're getting strawberry with

60
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,970
seven seasons of this show there's a lot

61
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,739
of episodes to choose from but tonight

62
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,129
we're gonna start where it all began

63
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,659
every episode starts with the midnight

64
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,549
society a group of kids from different

65
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,349
schools with different friends but the

66
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,609
same Canadian wardrobe team what a weird

67
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,620
coincidence hey you're here to be

68
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,790
considered as a new member of the

69
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,439
midnight society and you wearing a denim

70
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,909
vest in jeans so honestly you got a

71
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,019
pretty good chance here

72
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,459
submitted for the approval of the

73
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:30,639
midnight society I called a story the

74
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,359
tale of the Phantom cab here we meet our

75
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:36,599
heroes Danny and Buzz your typical twos

76
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,680
stereotypical kids who find themselves

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,019
lost in the woods speaking of names look

78
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,939

79

86
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,750
we're lost and we can't read the map you

87
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,239
are such a loser damn I've never been

88
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,829
burned that bad before by a piece of

89
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,060
wood I have a sneaking suspicion this is

90
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,680
the first time anyone in Canada ever

91
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,169
tried acting also is it just me or are

92
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,630
all these kids lines 80-yard by another

93
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,510
even worse actor his dialogue barely

94
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,889
matches up look we could circle back and

95
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,080
take the red trail I'm not sure what

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,500
you're talking about

97
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,830
oh yes that is that is a appropriate

98
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,840
music I have a feeling the musical

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,160
direction for this scene went a bit like

100
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,610
this

101
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,470
hey okay so the kid could possibly you

102
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,880
know die in this scene fall off the

103
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,500
ledge make a big splatter so it's real

104
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,180
more but it's real scary you know just

105
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,880
noodle around the guitar a bit yeah

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,080
