1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,100
What's up gamers? It's time for twitchcon

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,840
2018 epic cringe compilation

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,220
I got a couple uh...

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,880
Hopes, I got a couple of guesses. I think there's gonna be there's gonna be dabbing

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,260
What did I teach you the micro dab guys? Come on, Michael? Yes! Yes you, yes, beautiful!

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,860
I think there's gonna be some pretty

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,060
Lit

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,520
Fortnite dances

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,600
But most importantly, there's going to be...

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,560
I think of myself as like above the average person. I think of myself as like above the average person

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,280
Oh god

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,290
No, there's no good way to say this; I think of myself as like above the average person

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,880
So I don't feel like many people could relate to me

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,600
*Disgust*

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,180
I know you guys are gamers, so I got something special for you; the Elgato HD60S

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,820
This baby lets you capture in 1080p 60 frames per second. What else do you want baby? A-all irony aside

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,100
I-I've been using Elgato since the beginning of my youtube career

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,100
They're always on the top and I'm proud to have them as a sponsor

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,790
I'm even more proud because now I have my very own design. Thank you Elgato, very cool. Honestly, that is pretty epic

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,880
so basically you can plug this into your

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,590
Xbox, your Playstation. I you can use it to record with your phone,

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,790
iPad, all these kinds of things. It's the best way to do it

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,180
I guarantee you. If you're looking for a way to record video or a gameplay footage check out the Elgato 60S. Thank you

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,290
Very cool. Let's go on for the video

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,000
First of all, I really enjoyed the the Ninja roast, you know

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,580
A lot of the people here that are here in front of us are our viewers

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,320
Which is what actually amazes me about Utama that you're up here because most your viewers are outside because of the age restriction

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:56,540
*Laughs* *Cheers*

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,580
Damn that was a sick roast

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,460
I love how the audience just... apparently it's the greatest thing yet. No one's ever heard

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,900
*Clap* *clap* *clap*

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,040
 

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,680
I don't know why the audience treats like yeah, it was a it was a roast

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,400
Okay, I'm not gonna deny that. It was a roast and I appreciate it. But the audience reaction is just so mismatched this guy.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,300
Oh my god, this audience are dicks.

36
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,120
Shroud apparently won a competition. That was pretty epic

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,980
Hey, first of all

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,880
Thank you everybody for coming out today. This was amazing. We're so excited to have everybody and what an amazing tournament from you guys

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:46,660
So on behalf of the Doritos brand we are proud to present the Doritos Bowl trophy to team Shroud

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's give it up for team Shroud

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,740
They are your very first Doritos Bowl champions

42
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,560
They put in the work, they put in the time

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,880
I don't know why this is so funny

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,460
The Dorito Bowl champion combined with this music that's an epic moment. I can only imagine

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:14,280
putting countless hours into video games for this moment to get the Dorito Bowls

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,860
Championship

47
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:27,440
&quot;Hi&quot;

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,310
I always wonder, you know who's watching these streams but things start to make sense when you watch these conventions

49
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,599
A lot of things make sense

50
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,530
what a gentleman, you know, then put his slob on her back why bother with the hand if you're not even gonna

51
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,069
You know, I don't get it. How does you know?

52
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,869
I'm the most awkward handshake person in the world, but you'll that catch me dead before I use a hand hover

53
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:56,340
I don't get it. You can't mess that up. At least. How do you mess that up? It's literally impossible.

54
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:19,080
*Music and &quot;Kids?&quot; Dancing*

55
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,460
I get it, you know, it's just kids dancing. It's fine. You can't really go: ahh it's so cringe!

56
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:33,620
Everyone dances as a kid and it's an epic cringe, but the thing I don't understand is why are they people watching it?

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Look at that, why are there literally hundreds of people watching this?

58
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:49,430
And then this stan shows up, the god of a Fortnite dance shows up

59
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:59,660
Look at that child hahaha. Everybody, please give it up for the Fortnite dance crew make some noise.

60
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:17,120
I just realized that we have this-a similar name

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:41,380
Do they just forget to go on stage are there there? Okay

62
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,520
So confused everything is this confuses me I feel so old

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,160
Why do I feel so old I don't want to be like this guys, please

64
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,180
Someone save me, make me enjoy things again. Fortnite, everything is just killed me

65
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,360
Oh yeah, this is my dance!

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,800
Oh yeah

67
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,460
Now that's epic

68
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:10,319
Okay, I feel like knowing the Fortnite dance's at this point is the equivalent of knowing how to knowing how to breathe apparently every

69
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,900
Kid ever has just studied in front of the mirror how to do the dance

70
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:21,099
You know that anyone that knows the fortnight dance deliberately took time to watch up go to online to watch a fortnight dance

71
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:25,770
Tutorial to make sure that they can follow the movement so that they can do the dance as well

72
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:42,450
But unless you know this dance don't even talk to me, okay?

73
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,099
I'm not sure if this is twitch calm, but it's a beautiful clip grab this

74
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:46,860
Uh

75
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,820
Black Monster right here. That's right. I don't know why we call it that

76
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,180
I'm gonna have a, you hear that cracking open a cold one Duncan. You got a problem

77
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,340
Do you like the test of that Black Monster?

78
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:06,500
Let's just go to the game this is getting out of control

79
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,090
What just happened there?

80
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:15,290
No hug. Thank you very much. This is me at any convention. Okay, no physical contact we talked about this

81
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,620
I don't want to end up in a cringe compilation. Okay? No hugs. No nothing

82
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,760
This guy knows what's up, and I can respect that dammit

83
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,570
You just dodged a bullet right there very easy

84
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,050
I mean

85
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,510
Why would you hug if you're on camera what an idiot get new friends that guy. Well if you guys didn't know his actual first

86
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,980
name is Dick

87
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,100
Which it must be tough being named after your favorite celebrity body part that go after to gain popularity

88
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
Drake

89
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:53,420
Marshmallow, Mark Cuban who's next?

90
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:00,570
Hey

91
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,130
I mean I only lag like at a few spots

92
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,860
Yeah, I do you want my backpack

93
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,020
You'll have to come to my room to get it though. I

94
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,180
Think it's a win-win but you know. What? Heh, I'm just jokeing!

95
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,580
Okay, it's a joke

96
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,360
*Laugh*

97
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,220
I think it's a win-win, I can't believe I just said that

98
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,400
*Laugh*

99
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,600
&quot;It was a joke! It was a joke guys!&quot; I think poco laws. You gave me like a little clip.

100
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,100
Yeah

101
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
You wanted me to show of like, your channel

102
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:47,220
-working on in my team

103
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,890
Put the wrong video, I don't know what this is

104
00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:05,850
I'm so sorry. I'm really I've never seen that video before

105
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,710
That was such an epic, gnome

106
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:14,310
And these people don't even know the gnome meme. This is me when I try and make fun of people and they don't understand

107
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:22,580
And then this is unfunny and uncomfortable. Yeah

108
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,580
No one knows how to react that was cool I guess

109
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:39,780
I don't know what just happened

110
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,420
That's how you know your life you're sober if you ever get genomed it's time to pack your baggage say, goodbye

111
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,409
You might as well start digging Your Grave it's over. Then of course we get to the

112
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,020
*Clap*

113
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:56,460
The greatest cliff of all time the man that decided to summarize the mind of every twitch streamer on this platform

114
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,920
Let's just jump into it

115
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,280
don't feel like many of my viewers should relate themselves to me because and this is like super like kind of like

116
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:12,420
Like God like kind of weird is like I do think of myself as better than or not better but like bigger

117
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,780
There's no good way to say this I think of myself as like above the average person so I don't feel like many people could

118
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,700
Relate to me as like bad as that sounds I know

119
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,540
But like that's just genuinely how I- (Lord have mercy on your soul)

120
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,540
I think that what makes this clip so great is that he knows he's not supposed to say it. He's like

121
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,120
Ugh

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,940
it's really no good way to say this but

123
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm basically God I'm basically better than everyone else low key- like god complex. Just stop right there if you're ever in that moment

124
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,990
Don't cross the border. I mean I shouldn't be talking about this at all. Actually, nevermind

125
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,740
I just love how you know, you're a streamer. You're the kind of person that relies on donations from other people

126
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,190
You're basically begging other people for money and that's how you make a living. But uh you're so better than the average person

127
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,680
You're still uh you're still above the average person. I'm gonna go on a limb and say no. No you're not

128
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,540
You're 100% not better than the average person and anyone that think they're better than the average person

129
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,640
Is 100% not better than the average person if he just said it as a meme instead of hesitating and be like, you know

130
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,890
What I just think I'm better than the average person

131
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,730
I don't think anyone would care. But the fact that he was sort of hesitating being like, oh, this is kind of weird

132
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,730
There's no good way to say this

133
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,250
Uh

134
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,960
But uh yeah, I'm better. I'm better. This has been twitch con 2018 epic cringe moment

135
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,250
