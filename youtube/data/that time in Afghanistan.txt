bulletproof vest. Now. See just above the bullet proof vest here? That guy their their to me

7
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:45,500
that talll guy, that's Rogers here that's right. That guy, that's Roger. Today is

8
00:02:45,500 --> 00:03:00,060
story time with Roger. I don't know how it works. I just use it. And then you go through your own weapons you know that

9
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,090
you know. I mean we always usucally carry this, because it's lighter and faster if we also

10
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,860
have sure she guns rockets and Zukin stuff usually but instead to safety in

11
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,130
house fast we can just go with light scratches roger is here

12
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,829
roger is a special forces he's in airports pararescue jumper I went to

13
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:34,040
Afghanistan five years ago that five years ago and I just showed up in

14
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,450
Afghanistan with a friend of mine were there as journalists and Rogers like the

15
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,620
first person we met were blown away with like live with this guy

16
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,750
protected us in the office so let's talk I get it

17
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,340
talk to you from one of my buddies and he's like either so there's three guys

18
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,440
outside they want to talk to you about to do something with tattoos but I think

19
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,430
she talked to run literally grieving and we've got to ride Kate Nash dishonest

20
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,570
and I was like this seems really weird but i wanna talk to that was was really

21
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,340
I think so

22
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,769
context for that is I was in Afghanistan with my friend got campbell who's a

23
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,549
tattoo artist in what we wanted to do was literally set up a tattoo parlor in

24
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:26,610
the war zone in Afghanistan we didn't like tell the state department or

25
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,600
anything that that's what we're doing what we just did it it was like roger is

26
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,640
social forces bodies were the only people that like they really will

27
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:45,340
welcome to see in to their world you know it seems so simple and just clean

28
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,390
shaven you guys were there you know I think that initial concept of the

29
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,520
project that you in Scotland David they're working on it became much larger

30
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:04,660
upon meeting each other I think if I was down to one word authority

31
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:16,290
stories brought us up in attack helicopter you're so sweet testing the

32
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,130
hoist cable for way you're supposed to be using dummies that you're supposed to

33
00:05:22,130 --> 00:06:18,620
use in the mannequins

34
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:47,949
the entire experience the time to do your project after direct and i think is

35
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:56,550
year after we admit I began tattooing myself as a form of therapy and this

36
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,740
story on a slightly later no while we were over there you guys had these

37
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:10,490
playing cards they had already know the death of this story that had he's

38
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,639
playing cards ahead naked men on them and they would use them as I T alternate

39
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,440
pray we left Afghanistan would like bulletproof vests all the stuff that we

40
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,330
had to travel through the Middle East with and get back the United States of

41
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,710
America and when we were in the UAE the united arab emirates they're going

42
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,380
through that and they thought and they find gay porn playing hard mixed in with

43
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,450
bulletproof vests and always get pictures you guys laughing you're back

44
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:47,510
in Afghanistan you are sexy in the raw footage you shot there then that when

45
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,139
the final footage you know segments section CEOs placing those cars and your

46
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,400
bags and this by saying there are few people in this world who had the

47
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,789
experiences that roger has had for him to be able to sort of settlement that

48
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,070
into the artwork that he's making now is an incredible thing I'm gonna linked all
