00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,650

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,230

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,470

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,100

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,970

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,580

yes wait what mother

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,050
oh my gosh guys we finally have a worthy

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,750
spider-man game that is just as good as

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,380
the best nostalgic game in the franchise

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,840
spider-man 2 in fact in my opinion it's

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,720
now even better with today's technology

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,570
I actually never thought that Spidey

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,759
would be able to break free from shinny

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,520
Activision's control guys and look what

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,409
happens when he does back with

27
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,720
Activision they milked that franchise so

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,659
hard putting out subpar Spidey games one

29
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,369
right after the other just whipping

30
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,820
developer B knocks into oblivion it just

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,950
they pushed him out far too early just

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,289
to make a quick buck well all of that is

33
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:20,700
over now it's no big deal right balls is

34
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,150
that it's a Sony only title I have so

35
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,150
many friends who just have X boxes and

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,310
and we were talking and they really

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,989
really want to play I feel their pain

38
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,940
alright guys here's what you do you just

39
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,450
arrow you just get one used or I don't

40
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,100
know if you can't afford there's so many

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,310
good exclusives on Sony at this point

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,959
all rise and zeroed on god of war

43
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,329
spider-man you gotta find a way to play

44
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,660
you I don't know steal a friend's ps4 if

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,040
you have to I don't care

[Music]

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,900
Joe you know I can see you right and

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,390
that's because nearly all of my amazing

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,850
spider-man 2 criticisms in that review

50
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,030
go watch it has been addressed here in

51
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,030
insomniacs version you can really tell

52
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,430
the attention to detail and love and

53
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,950
passion that went into this game it is

54
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,620
so detailed in fact I mean you see even

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,840
small little things that like interiors

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
of buildings from the outside of the

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,300
windows

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,880
Spidey's webs actually you can see them

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,700
attaching to the walls and even the

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,160
voice actor for Peter records his lines

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,770
to freaking different ways depending on

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,930
whether your web swing or in combat or

63
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,060
just kind of chillaxing and perched up

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,000
somewhere spider-man it's eurie this can

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,300
make it to Rikers yet not Rikers our boy

66
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,790
qualifies for the VIP treatment he's in

67
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,890
the raft got an issue that could benefit

68
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,560
from your unique skill set for you Yuri

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,840
anything I'm on my way huh looks like

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,180
Jameson's got a new episode ally wonder

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,860
what my number-one fan thinks about the

72
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,370
fist takedown

73
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,620
hell you can even take selfies with a

74
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,050
ton of Instagram like filters and photo

75
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,870
effects though I guess I'm an old man

76
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,150
because photo mode I did like one or two

77
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,610
it was like yeah that's it for me but

78
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,560
kids these days I guess they love taking

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:05:03,720
pictures of everything get in there Joe

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,090
the graphics are amazing though there's

81
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,310
some fantastic lip-syncing and just

82
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,800
facial models realistic bringing these

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,170
characters to life you helping me

84
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,530
through college and working here

85
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,870
sacrificing so much and asking for

86
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,360
nothing I just wish there were more

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,680
people like you in the world he's right

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,480
five years ago you walked in here and

89
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,310
told me you were inspired by my mission

90
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,370
to help up now it's you who inspires me

91
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,690
thank you me for everything

92
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,810
and the fact that there's so many

93
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,540
cutscenes especially compared to any

94
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,490
other spider-man game we've ever gotten

95
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,700
before it's a real joy though I do wish

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,710
the loading screens could be cut down a

97
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,140
bit

98
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,420
like zero personality but your suit is

99
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:08,360
awesome can we talk design details

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,150
the game has a great opening mission

101
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,620
putting you straight into the action

102
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,409
with a smooth tutorial for web-swinging

103
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,379
though it does take a bit of getting

104
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,539
used to at first you're gonna fumble or

105
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,840
out with it

106
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,210
[Music]

107
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,220
it's obviously one of the most important

108
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,310
factors in a spidey game is how you get

109
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,500
around and thankfully in my opinion it

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,260
is the best web swinging mechanics since

111
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,750
the original system pioneered and

112
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,180
developed by Treyarch Jamie fist from in

113
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,760
spider-man 2 way back in 2004 it is so

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,070
immensely fun and majestic to see

115
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,460
spider-man doing this elegant ballet of

116
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,240
web maneuvers in the sky just swinging

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,330
tumbling flipping diving then upgrading

118
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,850
it gives you access to even more

119
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,580
abilities like web zipping to fly

120
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,830
through the sky quicker and even some

121
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,150
fancy tricks for experience

122

[Music]

123
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,590
I tried carrying an arm explosive

124
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:38,430
intubating pursue okay it is actually so

125
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,840
good than you think you turn into

126
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,760
spider-man and you're going to do stupid

127
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,410
shit like other jobs Joe what are you

128
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,550
doing

129
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,340
spider-man no you're not getting him Joe

130
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,750
it's a video game

131
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,940
come on Joe just because you've been

132
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,260
playing can't you see it's been raining

133
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,560
I stick to things look no I am NOT gonna

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,870
be a part of this Joe watch it I'm gonna

135
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,320
do a triple backflip somersault onto the

136
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
ground and no Joe you're going to face

137
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,200
plant no I'm not I am NOT gonna watch a

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,510
stupid trick I am going inside you know

139
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,880

141

oh my god wait till your leg I can't

142
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:47,190
feel the other extremely important

143
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,950
factor in a spidey game is the combat

144
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,460
well how is it here well it's insanely

145
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,500
fun but what's so cool is so

146
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,230
entertaining to just look at the game

147
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,380
flow it's so dynamic I'm searching for a

148
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,540
word like organic I'm not really sure

149
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,310
what to call it but no matter how you

150
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,920
combo and what style you're switching to

151
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,800
in the middle of combat it all seems to

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,840
still flow and look good

153
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,090
there are finisher hits attainable from

154
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,880
focus meters you're filling up there's a

155
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,910
ton of different gadgets to approach

156
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,620
combat in all different kinds of ways

157
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,740
there's even environmental attacks there

158
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,140
are standard combos there are aerial

159
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,840
combos there are a ton of suit unique

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,020
special powers and even three modifiers

161
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,740
for each of those suits this shit is

162
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:54,569
insane

163
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:57,459
this is way more than Spidey fans have

164
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,829
ever come to expect in previous titles

165
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,980
this is pure passion and you can tell

166
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,870
they really wanted to go above and

167
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,300
beyond and get it right the first time

168
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,160
and that pays off now the most common

169
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,019
comparisons from from people and even

170
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,300
haters and I've made it - from time to

171
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,509
time is it oh yeah Batman Arkham ripoff

172
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,209
but guys let me learn you something if

173
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,069
you actually do your research you'll

174
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:26,350
discover that Spidey doesn't ripoff of

175
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,379
Batman in the same game that debuted the

176
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,290
best web-swinging system of old it also

177
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,410
had the contextual spidey sense dodge

178
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,470
system in groups of enemies as well as

179
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,019
the combo hits in an open-world game in

180
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,730
addition to the swinging trick created a

181
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,889
new combat system it includes an

182
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,509
uppercut that sends enemies into the air

183
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,490
with spider-man following quickly behind

184
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,769
to deliver more punishment it also

185
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,689
featured spidey sense which alerted the

186
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,399
player of an incoming attack giving them

187
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,019
enough time to push a button to perform

188
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,660
a quick dodge so it was Spidey not

189
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,300
Arkham Batman that debuted this and it

190
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,910
is further developed and improved here

191
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,769
so tell your friends or would you ever

192
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:14,510
see that comment just gets on my nerves

193
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,850
true but that's part of my charm isn't

194
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,760
it leveling up is so rewarding if

195
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,500
everything you do in the game is

196
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,990
rewarding in addition to the main quest

197
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,970
which I'll talk about in a second there

198
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,580
is just a ridiculous amount of content

199
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,800
here like an impressive amount look at

200
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,440
all this shit and some of it is pretty

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,960
creative too these are all the side

202
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,930
activities and everything here that you

203
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,940
do rewards different types of tokens

204
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,240
that you can use in crafting so no

205
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,550
matter what you're playing it has

206
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,370
purpose it gets you one step closer to

207
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,550
that new modification technology or a

208
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,850
whole badass looking suit look at these

209
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,920
they're so cool I mean take this one out

210
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,170
oh and this one over here makes you look

211
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,840
like Deadpool and this one like close at

212
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,270
night is so freakin cool and I gotta say

213
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,670
but even the one that you start with

214
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,070
that standard piece for white suit it

215
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,800
looks so damn good it's up there in

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,700
iconic Spidey

217
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,720
[Music]

218
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,660
you're still wearing that so I'm trying

219
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:28,410
to do the review all right so all that

220
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,710
is really awesome but how is the actual

221
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,610
story still there we've got a robbery a

222
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,690
few blocks away

223
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,080
spider cuts on it part man part spider

224
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,700
oh God

225
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,950
well Peter in this game is in his early

226
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,040
20s it's an older spider-man a college

227
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,290
spider-man he's already left the Daily

228
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,350
Bugle he's had his relationship with MJ

229
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,240
kind of fall apart and now he's

230
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,310
exploring being a lab assistant a

231
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,590
scientist there's even some slight

232
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,570
changes and tweaks to some of the

233
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,030
villains backstories and other liberties

234
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,890
taken here and there with the overall

235
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,560
spider-man lore and in my opinion it's

236
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,580
done well and believable see it keeps

237
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,950
you on your toes and it helps this sense

238
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,860
of discovery throughout the game even if

239
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,590
you're a big spider-man fan if you think

240
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,060
this will be more than a minor

241
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,150
inconvenience well gotta go hey good

242
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,830
luck Willie I have a feeling you're

243
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,780
gonna need it kept order in this city

244
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,230
one month and one month you wish you had

245
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,940
me back now I will admit it does have a

246
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,580
bit of a slow pace at first as it builds

247
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,170
up many of its character slowly that

248
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,450
part is fine it has you manage your

249
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,000
daily life is Peter doing these little

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,800
mini games like these science puzzles

251
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:18,330
Joe I actually like the puzzles in these

252
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,650
while also trying to be spider-man

253
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,170
battling a new criminal organization the

254
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,660
demons and this is where it falters a

255
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,520
little bit you're battling these demons

256
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,770
a little way too long in this first

257
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,470
portion even second portion come

258
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,600
especially compared to that final act

259
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,370
where all of a sudden it just throws

260
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,830
about every villain it can at you I

261
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,500
think like around 11 or 12 of them in

262
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,200
some form or another there is no real

263
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,170
disappointment there I loved it but I

264
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,180
felt like they were kind of throwing a

265
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,860
little bit too much at the end it should

266
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,900
have been spaced out a little bit better

267
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,390
but that approach where they use

268
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,150
everyone and as if they don't even know

269
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,400
if they'll make another game that is the

270
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,380
kind of complete satisfying story

271
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,810
experience that I feel better

272
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,150
earns the opportunity of a sequel and

273
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,160
with a plot line that they tease here at

274
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,650
the end for that potential I am all on

275
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,700
board Spider Cup surveys the city Placid

276
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,130
but seething with turmoil just beneath

277
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,940
its calm surface all in all to take you

278
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,250
about 20 25 hours to get through the

279
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,070
main quests and a few side missions much

280
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,140
much more though if you wanted to do a

281
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,630
100% full completion which I'm

282
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,540
considering and that is way more than

283
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,730
the seven or eight hours that you would

284
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,980
have gotten from amazing spider-man 2

285
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,580
that game sucked this game has the value

286
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,080
to back it all along

287
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,870
so with all these pros well this can be

288
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,450
an amazing 10 out of 10 yeah I know

289
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,519
you'd like it to be a 10 I'm trying to

290
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,060
give the final bird a hey is it a 10 out

291
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,380
of 10 of legendary rating on my scale

292
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:19,430
not exactly not really I mean there's

293
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,620
nothing major that I felt completely

294
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,230
ruin the game it's just a bunch of small

295
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,120
nagging things some things that I

296
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,700
mentioned before and some nitpicks that

297
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,070
kind of pile up towards the end that

298
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,380
leaves room for improvement but there

299
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,140
are some pretty horrifying bugs that

300
00:16:36,140 --> 00:17:01,339
we've seen and another thing the game

301
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,189
allows you to play is MJ and even Miles

302
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,500
Morales in certain sections but

303
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,280
unfortunately these are forced stealth

304
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,900
sections that in my opinion they feel

305
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,569
way too restrictive and they could have

306
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,100
been skipped all together with a

307
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,169
cutscene how spider-man could have done

308
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,240
these sections they just feel pointless

309
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,730
they aren't as fun or as tension-filled

310
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,620
as the game seems to think that they are

311
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,720
they got these stupid automatic fail

312
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,450
steps if you mess up a tiny little part

313
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:44,430
like tipping over a box

314
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,570
thankfully like I said the game does

315
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,520
have some well-placed check points and

316
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,770
that's a mark of a great and polished

317
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,050
game and it can be very challenging

318
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,060
you're gonna die a lot especially on

319
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,830
higher difficulties so it's not exactly

320
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,200
a walk in the park I'm happy to report

321
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,930
but it's cool because you could control

322
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,670
how difficult you want to make each

323
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,340
encounter with so many gadgets to choose

324
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,710
from one final thing to note is it does

325
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,120
have some cute E's

326
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,950
well the mere mention of that is a

327
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,470
negative for some I actually feel most

328
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,420
of them are used here they're use

329
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,330
effectively they mix with actual combat

330
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,610
and hands-on sections that allow for

331
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,660
things to happen

332
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,180
in an extremely cinematic way that

333
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,950
probably wouldn't normally otherwise be

334
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,620
possible however some of the boss

335
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,710
battles do use a bit too much of it one

336
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,230
battle in the final sequence in

337
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,420
particular just one little bit of it had

338
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,730
way too much and it made me slightly

339
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,830
disappointed in that that one segment

340
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,080
but other than that the QTEs are used

341
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,920
pretty effectively

342
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,860
you're playing it playing real fast I

343
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,080
guess this is the plan

344
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,280
[Music]

345
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,460
come on Pete you got this you got this

346
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,610
you got this you got this

347
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:16,000
[Music]

348
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:31,340
please don't screw this up

349
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,860
so in conclusion the game has high

350
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,740
quality production a solid interesting

351
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,050
story that actually takes risks a

352
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,960
massive open city with tons of side

353
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
quests ridiculous amount of collectables

354
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,500
as well as 28 count them 28 different

355
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,860
suits to discover and crowd in fact it's

356
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,170
got just about everything people have

357
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,540
come to ask for and expect in an open

358
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,270
world superhero game just about the only

359
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
thing I can think of from other games

360
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,380
that it doesn't have is I don't know

361
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,800
bowling put some bowling in there so the

362
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,620
final verdict for Marvel's spider-man on

363
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,460
ps4 and nothing else is a 9 out of 10

364
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,730
with a badass seal of approval it is

365
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,100
some of insomniacs best work and while

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,020
it doesn't have any huge innovations it

367
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,140
does so much polish to the highest

368
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,290
degree making this one definitely one to

369
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,950
seek out and play I just cannot wait to

370
