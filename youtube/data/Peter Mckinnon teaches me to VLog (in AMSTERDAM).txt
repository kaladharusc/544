26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,310

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,190
without limits and without anybody

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,050

36
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,900

Oh what you think renting bikes is a

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,500
it's a good idea

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,579

you look good back there Peter they take

65
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,690
their bike rules here really seriously

66
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,100
so you got to stay on the correct side

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:47,280
of the road you gotta obey traffic laws

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,710
how is it you can vlog it there's a

69
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,850
child coming at you

70
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,270
how can you blog and ride anything I'd

71
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,630
love to know that ready going through

72
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,240
the tunnel my thesis on vlogging is that

73
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,460
I try to do the best production quality

74
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,710
I can but the story comes first so I

75
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,660
never let my camera get in the way of

76
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,370
the story that's why I don't carry a

77
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,780
monster like this is because I don't

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,789
feel like I could be spontaneous with

79
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,639
such a beast yeah this definitely this

80
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,860
definitely it's a beast you get used to

81
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,080
it but this is turned into like a

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:33,370
romantic honeymoon

83

[Music]

84
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,850
it's his first time in Amsterdam it's

85
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,560
amazing here but we spending a lot of

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,810
time in this kind of threshold to this

87
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,760
parking garage because we're just

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,570
getting so soaking wet its cinematic

89
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,360
though its cinematic let's throw in a

90
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,390
little bit of mckinnon slow-motion ready

91

92
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,620
it's that kind of weather today where

93
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,450
you can't be waxed it's just cold enough

94
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,100
work you're wet and cold you'll get

95
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,470
pneumonia we're just gonna wait for the

96
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,400
rain to stop

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,250
why is your lighting in your studio so

98
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,580
good yeah I never used to die never used

99
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,810
to put the work in the lighting always

100
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,220
used the window and I was like wouldn't

101
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,630
a light forever and then a friend of

102
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,550
mine was like no buy a light so I bought

103
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,620
a light diffused it set it up nice with

104
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,970
a boom mic and everything and then

105
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,650
suddenly if production values went

106
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,270
through the riot in the studio and I

107
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,380
turned my light out it looks like

108
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,880
there's like a flashlight do you need to

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,200
defuse light you can use a shower

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,090
curtain you've got IKEA and buy a shower

111
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,800
curtain just throw something in front of

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,540
that light so it's softer then it'll

113
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,340
look like just money

114
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:45,560
Oh real quick we were having a lovely

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,380
day on our bicycles and enjoying all

116
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,470
that Amsterdam has back at the hotel

117
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,850
Peter actually is staying in a separate

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,190
hotel but then I checked in here and

119
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,380
this hotel is huge so he's gonna sleep

120
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,270
on that our couch and then I'm gonna

121
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,650
sleep in the bedroom which is just down

122
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,210
the hall

123
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,509
so I said last week we remember I posted

124
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,340
the video about Chantal that I wanted to

125
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,430
put more energy into using my channel to

126
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,259
talk about creators that I really liked

127
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,300
and whose work I really liked so even

128
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,530
though we're having fun and just out

129
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,690
here sort of Peters channel if you

130
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,880
haven't seen it Peters channel is the

131
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,259
channel that I think like he brings a

132
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,270
level of production quality to his work

133
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,880
in his YouTube videos that there's not a

134
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,310
lot of on this platform and I say kind

135
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,200
of in jest that he's helping teach me

136
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,240
how to vlog but I mean it like he is a

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,149
he's a total practitioner when it comes

138
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,950
to the act of photography and

139
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,020
cinematography how do

140
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,420
this is his vlogging camera it's not

141
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,050
even a joke Peter's not he's no small

142
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,270
youtuber Peters a very big youtuber he's

143
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,010
very successful on the platform but if

144
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,170
by chance you don't know of him or don't

145
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,700
know of his work should definitely check

146
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,649
it out it's below and he has like

147
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,180
despite all the funny stuff

148
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,070
he has genuinely like showed me a few of

149
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,290
his tricks and how he achieves like the

150
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,060
crazy production quality that his stuff

151
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,660
has it's now heavy this is you could do

152
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,520

what's the what's the master plan Peter

167
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,970
I think master plan I just continue what

168
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm doing it's like the first time in my

169
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,520
life I've been able to actually like

170
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,440
work for myself and just have fun and

171
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,630
like no limits so like maintaining that

172
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,510
until the next thing grips me and I want

173
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,800
to go after that 110 percent

174
00:10:35,800 --> 00:11:17,000
