1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,180
My daughter thinks that she is a white person. (You sure about that??)

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,720
&quot;I know that I'm white.&quot; (:O K _ H A N D:)

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,700
Mom claims her daughter's a racist...

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,140
I'm not fat, which is an african-american thing...

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,000
AGAINST HER OWN RACE!?!(lol)

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,040
Being black is so gross and ugly.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,680
You are saying disgusting things- (damn right thicc boi)

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,600
God made one perfect person: it's me. (oh no it's a zealot)

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,740
*FTM Transition*

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,440
That was supposed to be a little better pitch. (don't worry)

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,120
It's Dr. Phil time! Oh YEAH! *c l a ps like  a kid* He's back!

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,140
We got a F R E S H one for you guys.

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,740
This one just came out a few days ago and OH BOY, it's juicy! Oh my god...

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,940
Oh my GOD. (*animesque sfx)

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,840
You know, haven't we already seen this before? A young girl saying that she's something she's not?

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,340
I k n e w I w a s a b l a c k g i r l

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,680
In this whole time, I K N E W I T!?! I knew I was a black girl.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,620
So i JUs-

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,620
I keep saying it! I keep telling you guys... (get ready for it)

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,000
2018 should have never happened! It's Just - Getting - Worse

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
o k ? I hate to see this sort of discrimination..

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,460
Everyone knows that only white people can hate their own race, and no one else. OKAY!?!

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,480
How DARE she appropriate our culture like that!?!

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,700
D I S G U S T I N G

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,920
So let's see, you know, is this actually real or is this fake? [idk]

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,360
Let's watch the video to find out and see more, what she has to say on Dr.Phil. Phil time! (Phil Nye the Bald Guy)

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,260
It's Phil time. SMASH like if you enjoyed Phil time. *69mil will be ours*

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,200
I know a lot of people take issue with my B E L I E F S .

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,220
I'm white (NOT CLICKBAIT, EMOTIONAL VIDEO, 3AM, GONE SEXUAL)

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,840
We're not even five seconds in. I don't see how anyone can have any problem with that statement, honestly. This is D I S C R I M I N A T I O N

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,140
These people are discriminating. Let's keep watching.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,260
I'm a Caucasian™️ because

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,080
Everything about me is different from an African-American.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,120
(laughs again) I can't! How do these people breed? I don't understand. It's a virus. (vaccinate your kids) (You can't cure it, sorry.)

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,479
My hair isn't nappy (isn't that another word for a diaper though? k) (Oh, your hair doesn't like nappy in toddler speech. Okay.)

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,300
It doesn't require weave. My nose is not giant like (this D) like african americans. (Denial, denniaaall, you'reee in denniaaalll!)

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,740
(pewds) O h n o .(Did you know that a kid is doing the subtitles? huh)

38
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,600
Welcome to the squad [Squad fam lol] the &quot;I have a big nose, but I'm in denial squad&quot;. (This post was made by big nose in denial gang)

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
M Y N O S E I S N O T G I A N T !?!

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,409
*BREATHES IN DENIAL* (Who keeps reversing these, by the way?)

41
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,740
It's okay..

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,700
Okay? We learned to deal with it, one step at a time. Except that we don't. And we never learned.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,260
My ears. I don't have black people ears, because they're really giant (like this D) (I'm with micropenis.)

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,180
*Pewds having a stroke* Da-a-whatisa-whata-whata-whatahell-wat-ta-who-who-te-hell-are-you

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,780
Most african-americans speak G h e t t o, but when it comes to black people, I think they're all ugly, and I have nothing in common with them. (she's not proud) (Definetly not, other subtitler guy.)

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm different from African Americans because I'm white. My figure is just like Kim Kardashian (What a bold claim) and she's a wonderful role model. (yes Kim, role model me)

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,920
Okay, now you've just become outrageous! *Pewds laughs* Now you've taken this step one too far.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,950
Kim Kardashian is NOT a fantastic role model! (Thanks for the obvious, Pewdiepie-senpai)

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,000
Everyone knows that, point proven!

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
You have no other arguments, L A D Y.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,200
I act and I think like a white person instead of a black person

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,560
I believe that I'm completely and U H M

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,640
U T T E R L Y better then them. Like, we're on t w o different levels. Like, U H

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,960
Well, now she's speaking like a true white person. *Pewds laughs*

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,280
Wait, wait a minute. What I meant was

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,870
listen what I meant was that she thinks she's better than everyone else

57
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,790
That's what I meant. Just to be clear today

58
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,200
My lawyers telling me that I'm gonna have to edit that one out. (heck)

59
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
When I think about African Americans

60
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,100
I feel like asking them what is wrong with them? *LOOOOOL!*

61
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,120
*Pewds laughs* I'm just gonna go on a limb here and say that

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,500
That's how everyone sees you as well

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,160
Okay, so we get it. She's black I mean

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,640
*Pewds has a seizure*

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,239
White. Caucasian. Caucasian . So what does she have?

66
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
What evidence does she have to back up these claims?

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,230
Okay, because I don't know about you, but I'm not 100% convinced, not yet. At least. You know, I'm I have an open mind

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm a progressive mind. What can I say? Let's see what she has to say.

69
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,069
I suppose it's race. I tell her she's just ignorant

70
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:53,250
There's nothing wrong with my views or beliefs because I have freedom of speech and everything I'm saying is true

71
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,250
Do you know I am right? (no u r left)

72
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,680
Because of freedom of speech god d*mmit :)

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,970
And

74
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,600
Everything that everything I say is true. That's right. What else do you got libtards? You got nothing on me

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,240
You got nothing. Everything I say is true. No u

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,230
Okay, time to sit in the studio with my man

77
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,690
My lord, dr

78
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,330
Phil™️

79
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,000
Bless his soul and let's see what she has to say about herself

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,420
Now would like to clarify the fact that I am nowhere near

81
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,880
delusional. I'm actually very capable and a very intelligent person. So -

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,540
I love this show (everyone does)

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,240
I-I truly loved them so much as you're seeing these kid.

84
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,080
She's 16. Oh my god. No *pewds think that she's a 69 year old*

85
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,150
What is with these kids?

86
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,740
How did this keep happening? I don't believe this is real.

87
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,500
I really don't believe this is real.

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,700
Being delusional and being intelligent are not mutually exclusive.

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,200
Well, I feel like if you're being delusional then you've got to be some type of *not okay*.

90
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
And I'm not that! (roasts 101)

91
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,500
Hey, you can't say that word! *Pewds laugh*

92
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,560
*orgasms*

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,000
2018: Pewdiepie telling people what they can't say. *Pewds laugh*

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,129
Well.. I have two things to say about that.

95
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,200
What did he say?

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,280
What did that guy say?

97
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,840
Someone who's a like a mime, mimic person? You tell me what he said. (champagne)

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,100
*repeat* Well, I have two things to say about that.

99
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,460
Ass licker? No.

100
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,600
*repeat again* I have two things to say about that.

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
No, wait.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,120
I have two (four) things to say about that.

103
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,100
Using that word, uh.. is very derogatory.

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,540
So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't use that word.

105
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,500
Yeah, well, okay, well I

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,060
understand only because I'm a very respectful person,

107
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,540
and if you wish that I don't use that word then I most definitely won't use it.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,600
Okay, appreciate that.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Okay, no problem!

110
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
*pewds laugh* When you say that-

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's the script for my next apology video right there.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
My god, that was beautiful! *pewds laugh*

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,700
If only I knew, if only I knew things would be different.

114
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,000
Things could be so different.. *pewds laugh*

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This gets better and better, I love this.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,980
Okay, so we get it, but how do you know?

117
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,120
Okay, how do you know that you are Caucasian™️?

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,000
'Cause everyone else is not convinced, yet at least.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Like I said: open mind, ready to be blown!

120
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,100
You believe yourself to be Caucasian™️

121
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,000
tell me why you believe that to be true.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,949
Well, I know I'm a Caucasian™️ because when I wake up in the morning,

123
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,700
I just have such a great life and that my hair is so perfect. (and that's how you know you're a Caucasian™️)

124
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,259
Because I wake up in the morning,

125
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,000
I just have such a great life guys.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,020
Smash like if you think society is real.

127
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,940
Smash like if you believe in society!

128
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,100
and I'm not fat also,

129
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,600
which is also a really African-American thing. *crowd noises*

130
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,000
So like I'm just nowhere near like them and plus they're so thug and crimin-

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,590
She's just throwing out these things, right?

132
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,700
*Pewds trying to English* She's just keep going all that saying all these crazy things.

133
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm not buying it.

134
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,040
I am not convinced.

135
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,320
Okay.. um.. (speechless Phil) *crowd laughs*

136
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,460
G: Yeah. Pewds: Damn, Dr. Phil just hit her with that

137
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,020
K

138
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,750
OoOh audience hit her with the E y e r o l l

139
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,160
DAMN that WaS EpIC

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,700
I don't just think I'm white, I know that I'm white.

141
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,330
and- *Dr. Phil gets cut off* There's no doubt in my mind.

142
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,020
You said-  *go away come again another day* Even though I have told you,

143
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,900
that your father was not your father (OOFT) (WOAH THERE SLOW DOWN) and that you are actually African-American.

144
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,100
You might be lying. I don't trust anything that anyone else says. I know that I'm white.

145
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,240
Wait I'm so confused. Wait, what?

146
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,260
Did she lie about who her father, was and that's how this happened?

147
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,240
Is this possible that this is real after all and I look like a giant buffoon?

148
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Oh...Oh...Oh, guys...I just realized I have to end this video now.. (k bye) (Goodbye, Pewdiepie-senpai!)

149
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,420
Smash like if you enjoyed (or not) and I am SO sorry about everything that I was saying,

150
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,900
Uh.. I'm just going to... *Outro Plays* (woah the video is over :o ??) (Get ready for it...)

151
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,900
JuSt KiDdInG! I'm back, everybody! (Came from nowhere) Alright. (wow, bamboozled again)

152
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,700
If you ask me, my sixteen year old daughter has a very out of control identity crisis-

153
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,500
I don't know uh- she truly believes she's white.

154
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,200
I.. O H *pewds laugh like a maniac*

155
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,740
Top notch editing there!

156
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,900
Dr. Phil editing team bro, a round of applause! ??? (Windows 7 Does Not Exist)

157
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,900
They really hit her with that D E S A T U R A T I O N, didn't they.

158
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
She truly believes she's white.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Jesus Christ, what is this.. (ur mum)

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,900
My daughter is a racist against her own race.

161
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,200
Welcome to White People, everybody! *?*

162
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,400
*Pewds attempt at dancing*

163
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,000
*?* I don't know.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,730
Alright, so let's hear what the brother has to say.

165
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,490
They always bring in, you know, the family and all that.

166
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,180
So let's get it!

167
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,820
My sister's treasure is that she feels like she's white. (lol)

168
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,700
My sister isn't white. My sister is African-American.(buuurnnn ??)

169
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,160
But how do you know that?

170
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,000
Did you forget about freedom of speech? 'scuse me

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Are we not gonna talk about freedom of speech all of a sudden?

172
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,840
Black people are gang, gang members.

173
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,020
I want nothing to do with them. They're criminal and they're thugs.

174
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,700
I am a very intelligent and non? delusional ? person :ok_hand:

175
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,340
*yeehaw music plays* Black people are gang!

176
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,800
A g a n g m u h

177
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Don't quote me on that, I'm quoting her! (quote him on that) (Yes, other subtitler guy, right on it.)

178
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,900
I'm quoting her. I'm quoting her. I'm quoting her. *starts quoting him on this*

179
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,200
African-Americans are uhm..

180
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,000
disgusting and thuggish and ugly and..

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,180
All these negative things- and gang, and gang.

182
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,140
Don't forget that. ?

183
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Do you feel that way about your brother?

184
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,000
I would never want them to actually be on the same level as African-Americans-

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,500
But your mother's African-American

186
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,000
*Windows XP Shutdown Sound*

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,760
Pewds: Ok so let's get into the issue,

188
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,800
I want to know how did this happen, okay?

189
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
How do you end up like this?

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,360
And you allowed your children to believe that he was their biological father.

191
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,500
Yes, I did. -Why?

192
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Because he was the only father figure

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,826
that I had for my children. Pewds: Oh.

194
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:32,300
When (Pewds: Oh!) he passed.

195
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,630
Oh, oh..

196
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,900
Oh, so it is like that. Okay, okay, alright guys. T h i s i s N O T e p i c .

197
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,300
You decided to tell them the truth.

198
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,100
Yes, I wanted them to understand that they were African-American.

199
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,960
In fact, as opposed to thinking they-

200
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,700
Well, you didn't do a good job at that, did you? *hEhE*

201
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,000
That clearly did not work out, okay?

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It seems like only a gaggle of um.. African-Americans..

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,080
And they were really gross! (DISGUSTANG)

204
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,200
So of course, the producers at Dr. Phil's thought..

205
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,079
&quot;Let's take her to white people neighborhoods!&quot;

206
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,500
Great idea. Thank you. VERY cool!

207
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
*inaudible screechy sound* It looks like a Gucci design! Everything!!

208
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,280
And they have a chanel, I think I'm gonna die.

209
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,700
Hello to my fellow Caucasian people, they were so beautiful! *i've given up on everything*

210
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,080
HoW Do YoU Do FeLlOw CaUcAsIaNs!?!

211
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,000
My fellow Caucasians, how do you do? What a lovely wEaThEr!?!

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,540
Walking up to strangers randomly, Jesus Christ.

213
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,850
So that's probably the reason why I most likely would fit in here the most, cause y'know,

214
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,400
I also am a Caucasian person and this is where I bElOnG!

215
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,780
Okay, we get it. You're WHITE. Okay, we get it.

216
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,600
Almost all black people have diabetes. (WHAT) All of them are fat. None of them are like-

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
Dr. Phil the Snowflake Melter: I have diabetes.

218
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
Really? Oh I feel so bad for you, are you ok?

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah I'm good alright. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Wait, so Dr. Phil is black then. Oh my GoD!!??!!

221
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,300
*pewds falling in love with Dr. Phil*

222
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
I LOVE HIM!!!

223
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,020
And you can hear by the reaction in the crowd,

224
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,880
some of them are African Americans cause I can hear the fact it's getting real loud in here.

225
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,300
You need some help big time. *heckin roasted*

226
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
aHoOh

227
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,340
Okay, so she thinks she's Caucasian. Okay.

228
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,900
She thinks she's Caucasian. Why? Because her dad growing up was white.

229
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,360
And she was lied about that being her father. It's a sad story, right?

230
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,160
It's not something you make fun of.

231
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
Unless... unLESS...

232
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,900
I'm interested in doing this story because I think it's a teachable moment,

233
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,600
and not for sensationalistic shock value because of some of the outrageous things that she says,,,

234
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
so I don't think she's doing them to get attention

235
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,360
I think she's doing because this is how she actually feels and believes.

236
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,400
Mother: Yes. Dr Phil: Would you agree?

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:56,800
*curb your enthusiasm piano music plays*

238
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,580
Hey!

239
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,900
Look at that everybody. Oh, it was fake all along!

240
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,700
That's right. Looks like I'm not such a bad person after all!

241
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,000
???

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,900
We all know. No, she's not mentally ill!

243
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,000
She's not mentally ill!

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,050
This girl just wants to be like the catch me outside girl! (cash me ousside how bout dat)

245
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:25,000
She wants to be like Tracey Barbie. She wants to be like all these kids who Dr. Phil makes famous for stupid shit. (gasp)

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,300
Well, wEll, wELL, you know what? I'm not complaining. *Pewds laughs*

247
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,200
The more dumb kids the better, I say. It's entertaining.

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,680
Regardless, thank you. Very cool. And what is real?

249
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,220
HmM?... Who am I to say that she is a not-Caucasian?

250
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,900
The Caucasian group of which I'm a member, (you have to take a test to recieve a membership)

251
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,200
Uh.. You are not welcome. *audience claps*

252
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Let me tell you! (HOLY SH*T HECKING ROASTED MY DAD DR PHIL DID IT AGAIN)

253
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh wow. Wow. Wow. (hating herself atm)

254
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,800
This is so weird.

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,600
You have Dr. Phil saying to an African-American

256
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,900
&quot;You're not welcome&quot;

257
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,800
WHAT IS HAPPENING!?! Okay.

258
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,100
Hope you guys enjoyed this video sMaCk. What do you guys think?

259
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,260
Is she Caucasian or not? Leave a comment down below and remember to subscribe!

260
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,600
Hopefully T-series hasn't beat me yet. (Let me check. Nope, not yet.)

261
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,000
We're trying to beat T-series to 69 million subscribers. (nice)

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
If we can make that happen,

263
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,160
that would be an epic gamer moment.

264
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
Thank you guys for watching this video, and I'll see you guys tomorrow!
