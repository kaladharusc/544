1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,820
I'm still alive

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,000
God damn it!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,300
God bless you Mr.Beast (he moisturises)

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,580
God bless your soul (angelic music plays)

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,180
You know what it looked like all hope was lost.

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,400
Everyone was tweeting,

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,460
''PewDiePie is about to get taken over.''

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,180
''PewDiePie,''

9
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,460
All the mass media is just celebrating

10
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,100
''Yes!''

11
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,720
''This Indian company,''

12
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,900
Anything except Pewdiepie, basically.

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,300
But Mr.Beast (a.k.a our champion)

14
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,420
You saved my life

15
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,420
I owe you my life, thank you.

16
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,420
Mr. Beast: I bought a bunch of billboards,

17
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,000
Ah, dude, we got the double billboard.

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,900
We don't mess around

19
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,420
Went on T.V,

20
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,380
Grab your phone, go on youtube, search Pewdiepie,

21
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,700
And subscribe to him.

22
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,900
Did radio ads,

23
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,100
[Mr. Beast on radio] No one kills memes (uh yes they do)

24
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,800
as quickly and efficiently as this Swedish man. (Not a good thing to kill memes)

25
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,100
I hope they haven't passed me when this video goes up.

26
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,100
I have one final thing, though.

27
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,100
I have one last resort.

28
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,600
That I have not used yet, okay?

29
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,700
Because I haven't had to use it, yet.

30
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,300
[Pewds reads] An Indian channel

31
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,800
will soon overtake Pewdiepie to become the most subscribed on YouTube.

32
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,100
You're saying a million dollar company which has thousands of employees

33
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,100
which releases 5-10 videos a day

34
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,300
have their ads everywhere only followed by people who understand Hindi

35
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
is up against a self-made guy

36
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,100
who came at this point *( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*

37
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,700
by starting making videos at home

38
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Has been No.1 youtuber for 5 to 6 years

39
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,600
has following from all around the world

40
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,700
puts...eh..a lot of effort

41
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
Ok, that's a bit of a stretch

42
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,500
And even many of them gets copyright strike

43
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
That is not a stretch!

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,200
He doesn't care; will be making videos for his fans

45
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,700
And will always be No.1 to his fans (That comment forgot to put &quot;Poods makes original content for everyone.&quot;)

46
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
? That is ? so sweet ?

47
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,900
It's interesting how many people just hate me so much

48
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,900
that they'll literally celebrate anyone

49
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,000
taking over.

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,700
Bunch of cry-babies (True)

51
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Well you can keep crying for a few more days

52
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,400
(awakens devil-form) CaUsE We'Re sTilL in iT!

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,500
Mr. Beast impact

54
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah, it was crazy

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Honestly

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
What do I have now?

57
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,800
I almost have 60...*skrattar*

58
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,560
?*claps*?

59
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,260
Its working

60
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,260
When all hope thought it was lost (who the freck is hope?)

61
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,260
It's like in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;

62
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,260
When that part happens, you know? (???)

63
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,800
You know what I mean, come on.

64
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Pentagon. Hexagon.

65
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Octagon. A L L  R E V E N U E  G O N E.

66
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,900
What can I say?

67
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,800
I've learned from my mistakes because of my moral code

68
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,500
And no other reasons

69
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,900
Look at this. You guys are really trying hard now

70
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,800
Aren't you?

71
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,700
Posting this again just reminded that

72
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,800
we are winning the ENTIRE war

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Because..eh..T-series barely have any followers on Twitter

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
I don't get it though

75
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
the whole thing is so confusing to me.

76
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,760
&quot;You may have won the battle, but not the war.&quot;

77
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,320
They haven't won YET!!

78
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,000
Errrrrr!!!

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
&quot;Working with SpaceX and Tesla&quot;

80
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,440
&quot;Hosting Meme review with Pewdiepie&quot;

81
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,000
?

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,580
?

83
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,280
?

84
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,820
?

85
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,320
?

86
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
COME ON ELON!! We need your help!

87
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,400
Please Elon Musk, please! (we beg you)

88
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
ELON MUSK-CHAAAAN

89
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,000
&quot;Stop sending me this sh*t&quot;

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
So many fake tweets now

91
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,600
I feel like this is fake, too.

92
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
People just won't let go.

93
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey, look it's another fake tweet

94
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How original!

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
&quot;Okay fine we'll release Scare Pewdiepie season 2&quot;

96
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,100
&quot;But am I gonna?&quot;

97
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,900
*fax attac*

98
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh right it's tana mongoose

99
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
I was like, what reference is that

100
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm getting old guys. I'm getting too old for memes.

101
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,080
&quot;Imagine writing something and not being able to erase it&quot;

102
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
That just gave me a thought, like

103
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,100
What about when you're 8 years old

104
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,200
And some- *Plans malicious plot against T-Series by an innocent giggle*

105
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
someone throws, you know cuz' memes

106
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,240
are all about being obscure, and people not really getting it.

107
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,660
You're 80 and someone hits you up with a Uganda Knuckles

108
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,020
and just one person's like,

109
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,420
Hell yeah. We're trollface.

110
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,260
*drama music plays* Trollface. The ancient relic. The ancient symbol

111
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,900
of...

112
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,000
trolling Libtards.

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,700
*laughs* Back in my day

114
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,620
&quot;Imagine writing something and not being able to erase it.&quot;

115
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,680
This post was made by Pencil Gang.

116
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Pencil Gang is also sponsoring this video (That includes your pencil)

117
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
Thank you very much Pencil Gang.

118
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,360
Pencil Gang has decided to join our cause against T-Series

119
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,260
???? Pencil Gang (lolwut)

120
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,080
&quot;Felix, do you think your thoughts in English or in Swedish?&quot;

121
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,580
I don't know. *laughs*

122
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,320
Did you ever think what your thoughts are?

123
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,720
No, I don't think about it.

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
Probably English.

125
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,720
Sometimes, I speak a lot during my sleep and Marzia's who says I speak in Swedish.

126
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,940
So... I guess there's a, there's a part of Swedish, part of me still in there.

127
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,280
Kicking and screaming

128
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,440
He bought every billboard in my city for this.

129
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,660
*laughs*

130
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,760
Okay, uh- I, if you haven't watched the video, you get it yet.

131
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,460
Check it out, link in the description.

132
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,140
God bless you Mr. Beast.

133
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,080
Now if anyone else will stand up

134
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,900
If any other YouTubers will stand up, in this fight

135
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,280
Which side of war will you be on History...

136
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,160
Channel.

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,140
&quot;Here's something I made for Pewds, I hope you- you fellow 9 year olds like it!&quot;

138
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,260
That is pretty epic!

139
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,940
..I must say (lower down your volume if you're using headphones)

140
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,300
except they never accepted my CHALLENGE!!

141
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,660
You have no idea what my twitter feed is right now.

142
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,580
You don't even wanna know.

143
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,960
Dad: Why the eff (f) you crying so damn loud

144
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,360
So proud of Marzia for taking a big step today and following her heart.

145
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
Goodbye YouTube.

146
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,980
??

147
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,480
?

148
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,260
? can ? we ? get a?..... F? in the? chat

149
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,080
*laughs*

150
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,820
You know she could've given me the channel, atleast.

151
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,240
So I could be T-Series but you know I guess I gotta be supportive.

152
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,640
Felix, don't forget to make the video that is 5 minutes slowed down 2x to make it 10 minutes.

153
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,740
Why make it 5 minutes when I can make a 10 minute video

154
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,800
20 MINUTES.

155
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,980
I wonder if I get more watch time that way.

156
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,060
Could that be like a wait because YouTube is all about watch time.

157
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
The more watch time you have the better.

158
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,600
So maybe if I do that...

159
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,220
Let's do it on this video.

160
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,260
Pewds: Meme review, when?

161
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,040
Elon Musk: Midnight

162
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,820
? ?

163
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,700
Hey a tweet that isn't actually fake.

164
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,660
How about that

165
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm still waiting Elon.

166
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,260
WE NEED YOUR HELP ELON.

167
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,880
~Tasukete Elon Chaaan~

168
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,740
I know he knows what that means.

169
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,940
A goddamn weeb.

170
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,780
I've seen hus videos David we will be going to therap- what?

171
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,180
What's a PewDiePie and why did you tell your grandpa to subscribe to him?

172
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,180
I'm doing my part.

173
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,680
?

174
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,320
?

175
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,160
When you realize PewDiePie won't be the first YouTuber to hit 69 million subscribers.

176
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,420
Come on guys. We have a goal.

177
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,680
We have a mission.

178
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
Please.

179
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,040
It's the only thing i'll ever ask you guys for

180
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,720
except constantly asking begging for life subscribers

181
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,520
and all that.

182
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,240
Well please guys it's the only time I ever asked for anything.

183
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,460
I could buy YouTube, delete T-Ser-

184
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,460
This is where the good ideas comes

185
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,980
Release Scare PewDiePie Season 2

186
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,300
BUT AM I GONNA?

187
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,780
DEM.

188
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,840
We were so close

189
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,640
I almost thought this tweet was real.

190
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,680
Incredible.

191
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,440
I was planning to make a video where I rate other people's apologies.

192
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,180
DO IT!

193
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,100
I already did it! Check it out. It was pretty epic.

194
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,860
I wish I could've brought in more apology videos.

195
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,040
They just took so long I don't know why

196
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Well, I got married in a PewDiePie shirt today.

197
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,820

Congratulations

Even 9 year olds can manage to find a... A love for their lives.

201
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,100
Ehh all you gotta do is really buy the merch

202
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,700
I've been saying this for so long.

203
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,420
*laughs*

204
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,080

Tha- (wut)

206
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,040
Honestly though, the meme review merch was that ?? The most supported merch of all that i've ever done.

207
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,680
and I just want to say thank you very much for eh... For everyone that got it

Logan Paul: Pretended to be color blind and faked reaction to seeing colors, tased dead rats, and made fun of a real dead body

219
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,940
Given a high budget sequel to his YouTube movie.

220
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,280
PewDiePie: made 1 joke

221
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,480
Well

222
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,700
It wasn't really one joke

223
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,360
Let's get real here, yes (idk what to call that laugh)

224
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,500
(cute voice but idk what poods is talking)

225
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,100
Yeah it was one, it was one joke, it was one joke.

226
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,620
and had his show cancelled because someone called him

227
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,840
it's okay because he's vegan now

228
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,120
That's true.

229
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Petition for Felix to make a cardboard Elon, so he will actually co-host meme review.

Also, I hope T-Series releases a similar video soon.

241
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,500

Like, all of them.

248
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,760
I tried to reach out to the kid

249
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,140
he wouldn't reply

250
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,520
But I know he commented on one of my videos

251
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,000
I know you're listening.

252

Okay. That would be epic. (it already is epic)

261
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,960
PewDiePie fans that are still not in the Subreddit

262
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,780
WHEN WILL YOU SAY HONESTLY THAT YOU'RE DOING YOUR PART.

263
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
You can't look at afterwards.

264
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,340
And go, oh I wish things were different. Okay?

265
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,020
You can't pull a Swede and be like, oh sorry Mr. Hitler Summer.

266
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,920
Please go (&quot;country up&quot; *I think that's what he said*)

267
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
Ah we should've done something.

268
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,260
You can't do that.

269
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,000
This is not it.

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,660
That is it.

271
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,640
That looks like me.

272
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,920
Is that the.. Incredibles kid?

273
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,540
Tim. I wasn't right I was right!

274
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,940
Getting an F in test.

275
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,180
Realizing teachers were just trying to pay respect (See the 2 &quot;to's&quot;? right after the to.)

276
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,520
This is showed. Nice.

277
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,180
YouTube, can you give me money to pay for rent?

278
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,160
To pay for rent?

279
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,760
Yeeeeeees.

280
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,800
Actually buys a useless belt like a boss.

281
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,140
I still have the belt

282
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,980
If anyone can let me know how to use it

283
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,060
That would be great.

284
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,880
Thank you.

285
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,680

DUDE, GET TO 69 MILLION, BEFORE THAT GODDAMN

328
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,940
*LAUGHS*

329
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,760
You know what, it doesn't matter. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO

330
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,540
There will be no EPIC BROFIST. That's right. I'm retracting all the BROFISTS.

331
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,140
Until this deed is done.

332
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,980
Now you have a true incentive.

333
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,500
Now you have a true challenge.

334
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Now you have something to do with a burning passion

335
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,980
To truly fight for it. That go FORTH DAMMIT.

336
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,560
WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE

337
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,140
GET THE FREAK OUT

338
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,840
Bye. *LAUGHS*

339

Hi

341
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,920
ANOTHER ORIGINAL CONTENT TO ENJOY RIGHT?

342
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
Have a nice day y'all

343
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,700
I think poods should bring back the good ol' brofist outro. Don't you think?

344
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,360
It's about almost 2:15 in the morning I finished the subtitles XD

345
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,020
Now you can leave in peace.
