2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,990
we just got back from venom guys and if

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,540
you don't know by now the internet or

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,930
the critics rather is savaging this

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,600
movie just tearing it to shreds what

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,230
what is the rating 29 good god it's

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,130
lower than night school oh my god 29%

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,059
for venom Tom Hardy's entrance into the

9
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:37,340
Cinematic Universe well that's more Sony

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,820
but in cooperation with Marvel you know

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,860
they're trying to keep that separate um

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,870
and he's got his origin story here so I

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,670
will report to you right away

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,940
is it as bad as the critics say no is it

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,290
it's close

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,469
is it an extremely good movie

17
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:07,610
no no not unfortunately I am sad to

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,710
report but happy that it's not that bad

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,310
that the critic said but it is a stupid

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,490
film not a stupid good one either though

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,840
no it's bad it's it's it's stupid it had

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,159
it takes a how shall I say a goofy a

23
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,180
kind of approach to to venom instead of

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,330
what I was hoping for this dark approach

25
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,790
you know venom is an antihero they tied

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,189
them in a comedy relief yes that's what

27
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,259
I mean and a lot of the jokes do not

28
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,990
land so you got a lot of cringe moments

29
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,939
especially when the movie goes off the

30
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,920
rails in the third act and that that

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,920
little reveal there at the end it's just

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,770
it's like oh no I was kind of on board

33
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,659
for the film honestly throughout the

34
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,850
first part yes so as I but as soon as I

35
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,490
heard it's gonna be pg-13 I really feel

36
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,680
like they'd hinder it big time baby good

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,680
venom is supposed to be this guy to just

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,659
take you apart

39
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,600
yeah and eats them don't expect them to

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,759
actually tear somebody apart on screen

41
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,290
but I do expect a little more blood like

42
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,910
it sucks because like now it's like you

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,770
had some me

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,420
using weapon but you just have like

45
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,410
blanks you're shooting it's fun it

46
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,910
really should have been our I think they

47
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,620
were promising when they first was doing

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,900
it that it be are some how turned to

49
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,330
pg-13 as our nose always meant to be

50
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,790
pg-13 we think that holds the film back

51
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,710
but I actually think there are more

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,950
fundamental flaws tonal flaws you know

53
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,840
the tagline Joe you kept telling me

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,520
about the tagline what's the tagline for

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,090
this

56
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,020
the tagline we saw was we don't need any

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,530
more heroes but yet the world does the

58
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,800
me do more heroes yet they treat venom

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,900
as 100% a hero he is 100% a good guy

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,110
he's got a big heart he's a big big

61
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,320
loser basically you know and and

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,470
unfortunately it kind of goes and here's

63
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,570
the thing this film really needed

64
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,960
spider-man I think if it would have been

65
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,690
a much better film with spider-man the

66
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,910
plotline you know no spoilers we'll talk

67
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,709
about spoilers in a spoiler section but

68
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,290
basically this is an origin story for

69
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,170
Tom Hardy's venom comes from space and

70
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,080
it has to do with him taking on the live

71
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,050
corporation who is monitoring for

72
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,959
symbiotes that that are come back from a

73
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,090
comet and basically venom has to do

74
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,490
battle with one of the other symbiotes

75
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,310
in order to save the world and then very

76
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,220
quickly wants to save the world and very

77
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,530
and very quickly decides that that you

78
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,290
know Tom Hardy is is his best friend

79
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,600
yeah that's it that's what happened and

80
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,290
they try to be funny and they failed

81
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,730
there were some funny moments you will

82
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,870
be laughing no I tried the entire film

83
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,690
yet make you laugh and I they did not do

84
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,280
a very good job they sprinkled some

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,630
action in and most of it wasn't

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,310
satisfying it wasn't very good yeah

87
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,020
there was a lot of one clip they

88
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,120
released that I was like aw man we did

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,120
yeah this is venom and that's the best

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,729
action that's our best action scene when

91
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,800
venom fights a SWAT team so you're

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,300
getting the best that the movie will

93
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,340
offer in terms of action in the scene

94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,360
that's already been released to the

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,260
public

96
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,970
there's the motorcycle scene when I

97
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,590
already said in one of our trailer

98
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,669
reactions was cheesy

99
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,220
turns out to be pretty cheesy looking

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,050
it's cool is riding a motorcycle be any

101
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,270
motorcycles but I don't totally tell the

102
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,660
stunt double yeah and then it does

103
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,080
culminate in a huge CGI fight we're

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,110
talking on the levels of black panther

105
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,199
bat of a CG flag fight between these

106
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,870
these two big muscley things but you

107
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,030
have the added difficulty of the

108
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,150
symbiote now live-action symbiotes a lot

109
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,160
of people said all the CGI so they show

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,110
this image of him with his hand turning

111
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,760
into a fist before he punches a guy and

112
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,150
somehow really bad CGI I thought that

113
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,850
the CGI was okay now it was bad in

114
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,979
certain parts you can tell it's an

115
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,320
effect but it's really difficult so I

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,410
feel for the movie that it tries to say

117
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,570
as accurate as possible to the symbiote

118
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,340
in the way the symbiote moves because in

119
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,620
the comics it does get very blotchy it

120
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,900
does spread itself out it does all these

121
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,320
things

122
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,510
but it just doesn't lend itself well to

123
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,930
live-action or at least maybe the talent

124
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,380
that this particular studio has so they

125
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,539
did it about as well as they could have

126
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,120
done it but my preference in the fight

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,979
seems between these two huge symbioses

128
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,380
instead of tearing each other apart kind

129
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,510
of thing I'm just more looking for a

130
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,160
little bit more practical effects a

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,020
little bit more fight choreography

132
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,419
rather than just bumbling around with

133
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,410
each other and forming improvised

134
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,000
weapons and I don't like that good to

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,539
say that scene at all and and a lot of a

136
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,430
lot of plot holes a lot of plot lines

137
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,169
just kind of left in the dust

138
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,470
he has a girlfriend in the film and she

139
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,419
plays a larger factor than I thought she

140
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,539
would but a lot of her scenes make a

141
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,370
little you know don't really make sense

142
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,520
the way the symbiote interacts with her

143
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,500
by the way they fix symbiote they fix

144
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,450
the pronunciation of symbiote I don't

145
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:34,630
know

146
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,790
they did that in ADR because they got it

147
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,380
wrong in the trailer and then it seems a

148
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,940
bi torso I don't know what they were

149
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,610
saying but I'm glad they fixed it and it

150
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,590
kind of shows you maybe the the the pool

151
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,660
between trying to be true to the venom

152
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,360
character and trying to capitalize off

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,730
of VMC use comedy and things like that

154
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,040
because I was really hoping for a much

155
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,680
darker film a film that really focuses

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,830
on the antihero elements of venom and

157
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,990
this doesn't do that at all it is Lee

158
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,210
you could substitute this spider-man in

159
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,190
there just be a much more Spider Man do

160
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,450
you think they were trying to like to

161
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,100
make a Deadpool type film where it's

162
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,510
like we're going to do this own antihero

163
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,040
thing we're gonna put action in there

164
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,750
it's gonna be funny and if that was the

165
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,400
case they did a really bad job yeah it

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,170
pales in comparison to Deadpool now

167
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,670
don't get us wrong let's talk about the

168
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,070
positive things on the film okay because

169
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,230
we trashed it a little bit there but Joe

170
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,970
what are some of the positive aspects of

171
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,940
the film I really like this I can't put

172
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,410
you on the spot Joe okay okay yeah no

173
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,530
see this is pretty hard because I

174
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,020
honestly did not like this movie what

175
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,540
aspect that did kind of like wise I

176
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,410
guess the beginning whenever he fuses

177
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,240
with venom mm-hm

178
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,930
oh the voice and stuff yeah any more of

179
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,910
that I want to see more of the bonding

180
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,050
with that but they would just find

181
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,180
however we've seen it done better yeah

182
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,790
upgrade obviously he was talking about

183
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,710
it earlier yeah so this one is like

184
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,260
basically he fuses with Brock he's like

185
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,870
well I know everything about you so

186
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,670
let's fast forward into the next scene

187
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,520
no you guys need a bond or what's going

188
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,910
on

189
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,040
uh-huh lay it up a bit or something but

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,140
yeah it was not enough with that but not

191
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,990
enough in the bonding right uh but that

192
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,360
bad potential I did like that incoming

193
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,790
stages uh what about you did you find

194
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,070
anything that you liked in the movie I I

195
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,960
did like the the same the same scene

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,520
where they're bonding a little bit there

197
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,650
was some really funny parts and then the

198
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,780
more that venom was really funny the

199
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,430
more I didn't like it the more that like

200
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,080
okay so he's not gonna do anything other

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,390
than be comic relief the entire time but

202
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,820
I think venom is a little bit like that

203
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,770
in the comics he's a little bit of an

204
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,480
oddball and I think that's

205
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,610
from a little bit of a psychosis but

206
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,079
it's under control with Eddie Brock a

207
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,269
little bit okay so I think what these

208
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,760
guys are picking up on and my positives

209
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,360
of the film is that I love venom I think

210
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,600
if you just took venom out and and

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,120
looked at his design obviously they

212
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,959
didn't use the venom logo yeah that is a

213
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,350
sucks for me but this looks like venom

214
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,269
this isn't Topher Grace's venom you know

215
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,820
this is venom I think they did his

216
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,760
design really great nine out of ten on

217
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,550
that his voice 10 out of 10 I just love

218
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,510
the way he sounds oh yeah I'm not venom

219
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,089
looked great he is the muscular venom

220
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,579
that he is from the comics he is sorely

221
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,550
missing his logo but that is how I would

222
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,260
like him to look if he ever met

223
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,600
Spiderman shiny and rubber looking and

224
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,639
fake looking anytime he was in a scene

225
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,339
like big as venom was like and like some

226
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:43,899
of the final scenes so see you seen the

227
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,579
trace agree are you thinking about I'm

228
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,389
was perfect and and I like his bonding

229
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,880
with Tom Hardy this whole angle that

230
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,350
they are outcasts because that's a

231
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,500
little bit from the comics as well but

232
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,139
it really more seems like venom is in

233
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,720
control of Eddie rather than them

234
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,209
working together I mean it by the end of

235
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,470
the film you're like why do they why

236
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,230
does venom even need Eddie really other

237
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,180
than the fact that they have symbiosis

238
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,089
together you know I was hoping for a

239
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,069
little bit more cooperation we do get

240
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:16,389
that a little bit towards that towards

241
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:19,029
the end but I was hoping for that also

242
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,690
the film is 2 hours and 20 minutes and

243
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,790
you would think what's a fuck this is

244
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,519
way too long and what am i I hate it

245
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,620
when critics right here shave 30 minutes

246
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,329
off the film blah blah is one of the

247
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,180
easiest criticisms but this film I felt

248
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,060
like the pacing was good like it never

249
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,300
felt it never dragged to me so I'll say

250
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
that pacing is good there's plenty of

251
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,199
scenes of before venom bonding with

252
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,410
venom and then the epic fight at the end

253
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,040
so I mean I was never bored were you

254
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,899
bored I didn't think I agree that there

255
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,250
was no pacing problem like there was

256
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,290
always stuff happening

257
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,019
but there's so much unnecessary stuff

258
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,690
mm-hmm and I feel I always feel like

259
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,490
these the directors of the writers get

260
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,139
so ambitious where they want to make

261
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,060
venom but they also want to tell a

262
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,709
different story but they don't want to

263
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,529
do what that movie needs to do right and

264
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,930
they want to lose the film floor I don't

265
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,480
know I don't know that they tried to do

266
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,130
up too much like they tried to give us

267
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,480
too much of his backstory they try to

268
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,800
develop too much of the love interest

269
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,860
too much and then they ignore the the

270
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,290
character development between Tom Tom

271
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,300
Hardy between Eddie and between this the

272
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,040
symbiote like they you don't get any of

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,149
that and that's what we want to miss

274
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,160
Gaby and then we got more character

275
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,930
development look I get it the bad guys a

276
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,240
bad guy they set up the bomb drop it and

277
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,860
then then they're like okay well where's

278
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,329
the action scenes it's like oh you got

279
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,389
30 seconds you get three set-piece

280
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:49,920
action seeds you get the motor sucker

281
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,329
you get the SWAT team and you get that

282
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:53,069
the final fight at the end and none of

283
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,500
them are really that's kind of right

284
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,300
here and what was released online

285
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,600
so overall the the villain what you

286
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,730
think there was the villain good bad

287
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,510
weak weak yeah I hate how these

288
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,519
symbiotes all have names like I don't

289
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,110
like I was like please stop calling him

290
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,050
riot you know no just stop it it sounds

291
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,139
hokey I just thought you know it's it

292
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,990
sucks I will say that the leader you

293
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,639
know that that's this the skinning

294
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,980
billionaire super smart scientist wants

295
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,100
to push great humanity forward yeah

296
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,440
Drake industries or whatnot he

297
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,209
significantly he believes in what he's

298
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,870
doing you know he in and he plays that

299
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,300
out very well on screen you believe that

300
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,649
he believes that he's doing the right

301
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:43,860
thing and so I liked that aspect of it

302
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,899
unfortunately riot his other half

303
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,610
doesn't really oh shit did I spoil it

304
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,870
unfortunately no you see them a trailer

305
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,829
you know okay well fine fuck it riot

306
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,949
isn't really up to up to par with with

307
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:02,430
venom but boy I can't help but but you

308
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,100
know like venom and Tom Hardy in the

309
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
film even though Tom Hardy really is

310
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,850
such an awkward

311
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,279
trick performance but that's part of

312
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,920
what made it watchable for me because he

313
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,850
was acting so bumbling weird in a set

314
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,579
like he reminded me of men in black you

315
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:25,990
know the guys haha he's just he's just a

316
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,540
fucking slob and always sweating I guess

317
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,550
because when I symbiotes with you your

318
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,290
body temperatures through the roof or

319
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,790
something I don't believe the faculty

320
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,949
changes the best investigative

321
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,889
journalist and like it's like this guy's

322
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,259
kind of an idiot like how is he the best

323
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,089
investigative journalist exactly that

324
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,949
leads to some plot holes he's supposed

325
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,079
to be a loser but is he really a loser

326
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,899
at this most successful investigative

327
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,790
journalism that does better journalism

328
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,889
than in real life because he's a fan

329
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,040
amongst people you know his his

330
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,470
girlfriend has a boyfriend character

331
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,970
come in and they have a little bit of a

332
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,940
friendship there you know and I so this

333
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,160
is the subplot is kind of interesting in

334
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,660
that way but you've seen these things

335
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,690
done better in other films and it's like

336
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,639
an amalgamation of all these different

337
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,220
things that kind of follows through

338
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,649
tropes I've seen some comments that this

339
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,529
film kind of follows old-school

340
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,689
superhero films and and this really was

341
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:23,889
an opportunity to try something

342
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,589
different to give us something darker

343
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,110
going even further than say a Deadpool

344
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,110
in the antihero direction but ultimately

345
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,209
wrapping it up in a positive way where

346
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,399
you can get behind venom and you can

347
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,050
still do that but I feel more like a

348
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,060
little bit of a CGI fest and a throwaway

349
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,480
popcorn film are you entertaining enough

350
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,380
no no no no I'm fortunate ly not for me

351
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,209
alright well let's go with final

352
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,740
verdicts then in that case and then

353
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,850
we'll talk about all the nitty-gritty

354
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,860
and spoilers unless you guys can think

355
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,420
of anything else that we wanted to cover

356
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,779
not actually what are we gonna spoil

357
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:05,980
they spoiled everything in this okay so

358
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,930
what would you rate the film out of 10

359
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,829
I'm gonna go for ok so right right in

360
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,329
line what I thought with people most

361
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,740
people were saying before it's just a

362
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,290
big dump on ya it's not it's not as bad

363
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,389
as people so slightly below average yeah

364
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:19,769
this is

365
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,509
a below-average film like if you are a

366
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,489
venom fan you're gonna hate this movie

367
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,410
if you have no that's where it comes

368
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,269
from because he knows some of the venom

369
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,489
backstory so venom fans you think will

370
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,079
hated I think well hey I mean it is a

371
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,050
departure for in many ways from if you

372
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,119
know nothing about it and you think that

373
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,249
he's kind of plucky and funny and he's

374
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,689
supposed to make you laugh every time he

375
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,379
talks then maybe you'll like this it's

376
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,449
slower than a comic book movie it's not

377
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,759
as action-filled as it needs to be it's

378
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,160
not as funny as it's trying to be well

379
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,199
by and then combine that all together

380
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,209
it's not like they combined together to

381
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,439
make something that's serviceable they

382
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,389
really do kind of a poor job I don't

383
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,799
even know this is there was a for but I

384
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,869
think right as of right now we just

385
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,790
finishing you you were thinking about

386
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,610
lower yeah but maybe the the venom

387
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,949
character and Tom Hardy enough I like

388
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:10,369
see I like Tom Hardy I think RZA mod did

389
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm not sure he did a very good job I

390
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,769
there was just so much not to like about

391
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,679
this movie yeah but it's not so many

392
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,749
bottles don't yeah but it's not it's not

393
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:25,049
horrible so four out of ten from Alex

394
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:29,100
Joe I'm gonna agree a four to ten I did

395
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,959
not like the end scene

396
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,220
the fight was very weak in my eyes mhm

397
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,259
the rating hindered it for me thirteen I

398
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,910
wanted to go see more of a venom upgrade

399
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,999
yeah don't film maybe you just want to

400
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,069
take those two films and meld them

401
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,259
together but way more of upgrade and

402
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,329
then just pluck the venom creature and

403
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,910
Tom Hardy and give it to that director I

404
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,589
think the main problem here was the

405
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,269
director of this film who also did

406
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,329
Zombieland yes which is why well we'll

407
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,270
talk about that in spoilers there's a

408
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,069
twist at the end not a twist but an

409
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,470
after credits scene that tries to set up

410
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,049
and introduce things but boy is it

411
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,360
cringe it's it's not quite the cruise

412
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,389
level of the predator with its iron

413
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:21,199
thing but this is this is pretty close

414
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,809
but fascinating in a way so final

415
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,699
verdict from me this guy's four out of

416
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,539
ten III think I enjoyed it a bit more

417
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,200
than they did I surprisingly if you turn

418
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
your brain off and you're just looking

419
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,350
at Topher Grace's venom then you're

420
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,480
probably happy that at least it's not

421
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,850
that and so you're like maybe in the six

422
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,220
out of ten area slightly above average

423
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,760
but no no no wait but no I can't I can't

424
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,289
give it that because there are so many

425
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,840
plot holes because it takes deviations

426
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,840
from the the comics and what I was

427
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,580
hoping to see a little bit darker tone

428
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,190
this film seems confused is it's an

429
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,070
antihero but not at all he's one hundred

430
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,419
percent of arrow just a plucky goofball

431
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,190
you know and I didn't I don't really

432
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,610
want a goofball venom I wanted a scary

433
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,639
cool motherfucker venom yeah and you can

434
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,409
sprinkle the goofiness and you can

435
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,740
sprinkle it right but he he is hilarious

436
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,990
he's constantly making jokes he loves

437
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,720
fucking tater tots and chocolate like I

438
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,860
know what the hell's going on

439
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,100
everybody's reaction to venom is like oh

440
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,380
yeah that's cool he's a fucking alien

441
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,539
and everything yeah alright well you

442
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,460
know and it's there's so many plot holes

443
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,669
in it and I really really wanted to like

444
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,860
to film more than this especially I was

445
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,090
encouraged by some of those but

446
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,159
unfortunately I have to report to you

447
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,490
guys that it is an average film at best

448
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,149
5 out of 10 all right we can talk about

449
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,370
exactly why in the spoilers however

450
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,039
would you recommend seeing in theaters

451
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,090
no no well here's the thing

452
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:08,820
you would it's not no because you want

453
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,649
to know why I don't know if this is

454
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,730
going to be a part of just the

455
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,440
promotional screening we saw cuz we saw

456
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,110
this one day early one day early from a

457
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,090
Thursday show it's a Wednesday but at

458
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,240
the end they showed a bit of spider-man

459
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,980
into the spider-verse almost like a

460
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,490
whole fuckin scene almost as if Sony had

461
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,649
no confidence in this film it was like

462
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,320
hey check this film out yeah I know and

463
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,240
then but I walked out of the theater all

464
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,929
positive because that little segment I

465
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:38,820
hate to say this it was way more

466
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
engaging and almost better

467
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,800
and almost everything that I had seen

468
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,480
except for some of the camaraderie

469
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,970
between Tom Hardy and venom that I was

470
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,890
like damn oh I cannot wait for

471
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,610
spider-man into the spider-verse so I

472
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,350
don't know if that's it's after the

473
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,880
credits you guys don't have to tell me

474
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,850
when it releases so I'm encouraged by

475
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,130
that but it really puts into perspective

476
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,560
seeing that so close to what you just

477
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,200
saw with venom venom just doesn't hit

478
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,530
where it needs to hit so yeah five out

479
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,210
of ten thank you guys so much for

480
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,760
watching stick around for spoilers talk

481
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,470
if you've seen it already or you don't

482
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,020
mind and yeah alright thank you and

483
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,360
we'll see you on the next angry Joe show

484
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:35,039
bye guys

485
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,289
okay welcome to the spoiler section Joe

486
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,190
what was the last little twist there the

487
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,850
last twist was basically the symbiotes

488
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,070
were gonna come here and take over the

489
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,940
planet

490
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,399
there's millions of them yeah basically

491
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:54,999
turn all of us into host but venom has a

492
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,100
change of heart why we don't know

493
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,559
because I'll tell you why because he

494
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,399
likes he likes it here and he's a bit of

495
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,919
a loser he even says it he's like I'm a

496
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,440
loser yeah he says that in the forest

497
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,179
when the wagon is Gilly he's like I like

498
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:13,210
you a loser on my planet and that's why

499
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,059
they say be bonded so well which is kind

500
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,869
of in the comics sort of Eddie Brock was

501
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,169
a bit of a loser but venom not really so

502
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:24,909
but I don't so they make venom a loser

503
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,529
and he's a loser they say and then he's

504
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:28,269
like I want to defend and this is my

505
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,369
planning and I'm gonna protect these

506
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,090
people

507
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,879
it's didn't I didn't believe it no no I

508
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,340
believe I liked I liked how in the

509
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,679
trailer kind of made it seem like venom

510
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,619
had some kind of sinister agenda yeah

511
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:42,999
and you weren't sure whether you could

512
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,769
trust him that's not in the film at all

513
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,769
the trailers didn't we did know there

514
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:49,179
was like that it was like five minutes

515
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,590
where he's like oh yeah I'll get the

516
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,119
Rockets because he was gonna be yeah

517
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,799
you're right so for five minutes he's

518
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,480
the bad guy gonna take over the world

519
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,269
and then something happens that we don't

520
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,070
scream it's probably the forty minutes

521
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,590
that was graciously cut out of this film

522
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,549
that explained all that

523
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:05,169
there's no 40 minutes cut out there oh

524
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:07,179
you just assume no they cut 40 minutes

525
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:08,470
out of this film get the fuck out of

526
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,149
here it's 2 hours and 20 minutes

527
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:11,470
yeah we're supposed to be so this is a

528
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,690
three hour film yeah Tom Hardy said an

529
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,519
interview that like his I don't know how

530
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,379
accurate well he said that his favorite

531
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,090
scenes in the whole film all of them

532
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,480
were cut out

533
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,879
holy dark comedy stuff that would

534
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,100
explain a lot of the things because

535
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,960
there's a huge plot hole look it will

536
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,879
get to by the way Joe the twist where I

537
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,830
was talking about was Woody Harrelson's

538
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,700
character but here's here's something

539
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,919
that felt completely like I have no idea

540
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,769
what the fuck happened so a side plot is

541
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,669
that the symbiote as it's trying to bond

542
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:45,190
with you it can eat

543
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,110
way at your organs if it doesn't feed

544
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,260
right and so we learned that the

545
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,630
symbiote is slowly killing Tom Hardy's

546
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,420
venom is killing any Brock and his

547
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,820
girlfriend discovers this and she finds

548
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,200
a way cleverly to get it out of him she

549
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,270
ex-fiance right and she turns on the MRI

550
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,760
machine and it spits out and then

551
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,950
they're separated he's like alright I'm

552
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,230
fucking leaving and he just leaves this

553
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,320
doctor and his ex-fiancee to deal with

554
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,270
this extremely dangerous creature on

555
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,430
there there's so many stupid moments so

556
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,690
he just leaves walks out the door

557
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,370
they're like oh what the fuck do we do

558
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,560
and her and they turn around it's not

559
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,120
there because it goes as they're talking

560
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,430
it goes up into the vents it possesses a

561
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,310
little chihuahua dog I thought I was

562
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,320
gonna get some like ridiculous like a

563
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,510
dog's gonna take over our fighting or

564
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:42,940
fighting but no eventually you know as

565
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,860
his girlfriend's leaving the dog sees

566
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,030
him and they it's all completely

567
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,700
off-screen she turns into venom so it's

568
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,950
cool that they got she venom in there

569
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,540
you know from the comics it's like why

570
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,620
didn't expect this

571
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,870
she later on in the film she encounters

572
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,250
him in the forest he's about to die

573
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,680
because the security guards from Life

574
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,260
corporation you know are gonna take him

575
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,140
out and kills everybody and she's got

576
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,700
some curves on him and she just walks up

577
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,350
to and starts making out with him yeah

578
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,230
he was really into it before she comes

579
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,260
out of the venom suit and that could

580
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,950
have been riot

581
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,240
I knew we saw Ryan oh he's alright those

582
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,690
curves those curves oh okay alright so

583
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,880
through the kiss he gets the suit back

584
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,150
but after that scene she's like 100% on

585
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,830
board with this whole venom thing she's

586
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,020
like rah rah go get it John RT yeah fuck

587
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,640
yeah let's do this together yeah like

588
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,830
I'm gonna fight too like I can do this

589
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,200
and I can do that but we just saw her at

590
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,570
the hospital like get this fucking thing

591
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,930
off of news let's kill it and it's like

592
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,150
what just happened it feels like there's

593
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,090
a huge chunk of the movie missing with

594
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,790
that plot hole by the way the the venom

595
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,190
thing likes her right she

596
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,160
notice after the SWAT scene he's like

597
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,770
freakin maiming these cops not killing

598
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,850
them because he's trying not to kill

599
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,890
them and she comes around the corner and

600
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,170
sees him about to eat a cop and then he

601
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,910
like transforms back into Tom Artie and

602
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,740
he comes towards her and she's just

603
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,150
reacts like it's no big

604
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,800
yeah get in the car go to the hospitals

605
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,570
like you were just a monster like you

606
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,460
stay away from me like you cannot get in

607
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,670
I don't know how loyal your girl or wife

608
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,860
is but damn that's and loyalty fine I

609
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,080
guess fiance okay fine

610
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,920
right but venom is like I like her he's

611
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,420
like encourages him to get in the car he

612
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,060
gets in the car and then proceeds to

613
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,280
tell her all of his weaknesses

614
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,080
venom is telling her his specific

615
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,020
weaknesses which is Sonic at a certain

616
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,180
frequency and fire and he's a holy

617
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,920
plaque you know you know these kinds of

618
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,690
these like know why is he doing them is

619
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,100
it because venom is a loser and he

620
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,230
hasn't the audience has to know because

621
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,940
he is a loser in an idiot apparently

622
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,440
that's a part of his backstory on his

623
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,500
planet he's you know the the runt of the

624
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,250
litter kind of thing and but I do like

625
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,810
that he wanted to repair the

626
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,180
relationship and he kind of prepared a

627
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,650
little bit of their relationship and

628
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,890
made that seem cool I liked it or

629
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,420
touching so but so he comes with so

630
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,950
getting then there's another flaw hole

631
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,010
what happened to the fourth symbiote it

632
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,740
didn't make it clear enough it didn't

633
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,450
make it clear enough because we have

634
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,240
four one escapes right away so you have

635
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,870
three in the lab we saw one of them die

636
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,250
because Drake makes a point of it like

637
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,440
where were you why weren't you watching

638
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,900
it and because the host died and the

639
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,940
symbiote died and he's very upset about

640
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,400
that one dying so that let's call that

641
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,500
one now a fourth escape that's called

642
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,690
that one the third one right and then

643
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,260
all shit that is no it's not maybe one

644
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,080
no it's not so so you have a venom and

645
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,010
riot where is that look like diet may

646
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,810
have shown it yeah I think it died but

647
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,630
it wasn't clear

648
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,420
so you're telling me to died in the lab

649
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,230
yes really it only showed one died in my

650
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,840
eyes it showed one died I mean if we

651
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,010
were looking for we probably could have

652
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,260
seen it was the first guy the the

653
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,270
homeless dude that was unique ran since

654
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,090
he died that simio died as well maybe

655
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,640
they never really make it clear they

656
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,200
because he was like all that was cool

657
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,050
let's let's bring in another host

658
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,640
well that that means i symbiotes still

659
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,200
alive cuz they bring in another host

660
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,770
right

661
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,110
I never saw the fourth fuckin symbiote

662
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,270
so I thought that oh shit man is gonna

663
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,860
be great we're gonna see scream we're

664
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,170
gonna see you know so a different

665
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,090
symbiote show up here when you didn't

666
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,580
expect it or maybe that symbiote even

667
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,080
though it was yellow will maybe turn

668
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,750
into carnage somehow and at the end of

669
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,250
the film I keep looking for where - girl

670
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,020
soon because like idiots they announced

671
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,430
that Woody Harrelson was in the film us

672
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,640
before this fucking film came out and is

673
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,720
he in the film but no he's carnage is

674
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,030
not in the film we have Woody Harrelson

675
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,450
playing Charlie who's the name of the

676
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,670
carnage character I don't know yeah I

677
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,500
forget his name he's just a psycho

678
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,080
maniac in maximum-security prison it was

679
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,060
so creepy was horrible he looks like a

680
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,940
redhead Cabbage Patch dolls with like

681
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,250
this weird short curly afro thing on

682
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,690
what here also it looks horrible I

683
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,360
thought it was Jesse you uh likes yo

684
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,720
Jesse Eisenberg yeah and I thought it

685
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,880
looked like you know the you know the

686
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,000
movie clown on Netflix you know it

687
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,750
looked like a wig and and I was like oh

688
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,340
and then he's like yeah and it was a

689
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,090
terrible pun yeah he's like it's there's

690
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,340
gonna be carnage he says it he says

691
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,920
there's gonna be carnage Oh double

692
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,860
entendres jour there's gonna be carnage

693
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,250
as in the character but he's also not

694
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,020
really he's just saying if I ever get

695
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,190
out of here I'm just gonna kill more

696
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,550
people but the only way to save that

697
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,860
would be if he would and he turned in

698
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,100
and he look 100% comic accurate that

699
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,010
maybe would have saved it because he is

700
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,660
carnage but when you just say

701
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,240
ownage it's like wait so he knows the

702
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,850
name of the symbiotes carnage before

703
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,560
happens or it just so happened to be

704
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,720
that he will cost guarded to carve out

705
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,590
whatever

706
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,410
if you don't know carnage is the

707
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,630
offspring of venom so I was like okay I

708
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,370
don't know how this is this is gonna

709
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,540
work out it could have really just done

710
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,180
this film much better without all the

711
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,820
plot holes without all these cut out

712
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,390
parts it seems it's feel like they were

713
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,150
trying to do too much they're reaching

714
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:47,250
for the stars but this one failed in the

715
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,960
same way that a lot of the original ones

716
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,520
did where they're trying to give us too

717
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,820
much of the origin and the backstory and

718
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,800
even if people aren't familiar you can

719
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,990
wrap that up pretty quick and make that

720
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,150
15 20 minutes in the beginning and this

721
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,270
felt like we got like an hour hour and a

722
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,220
half of life this is what venom is

723
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,050
before venom doesn't he and then I'm

724
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,580
doesn't even do any venom stuff he just

725
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,740
makes you laugh by saying silly things

726
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,470
yeah exactly he doesn't really I mean

727
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,690
he's not using webs he's more just you

728
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,510
know clawing into walls and stuff which

729
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,610
you know he's not run into spider-man

730
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,440
yet so it's not like he's mimicking

731
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,910
spider-man doesn't have the logo

732
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,350
basically this would have been a

733
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,790
stronger film if Spiderman was

734
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,280
incorporated in some way and without

735
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,840
that they decided to go with the

736
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,510
symbiote battle and the symbiote battle

737
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,550
just doesn't translate on-screen it

738
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,200
doesn't have the emotional impact that

739
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,110
it would if you had Peter Parker in here

740
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,410
in some way and and just you know their

741
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,440
their their villainy their fight I'm

742
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,500
hoping that I don't know I hear their

743
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,390
film is making money I hear it's like on

744
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,000
track 456 million so it's like it's like

745
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,040
don't do them better than predator it's

746
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,290
it's probably gonna do 70 million maybe

747
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,720
even more so it seems like it's going to

748
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
possibly do well enough to get a sequel

749
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,330
anyway

750
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,630
No maybe they can fix and take all this

751
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,400
feedback and give us a better film if

752
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,380
you're gonna do carnage do maximum

753
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,230
carnage and bring in spider-man to where

754
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,150
these two have to team up and take on

755
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,980
carnage because carnage is way more

756
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,220
powerful than

757
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,259
he's just stronger and and if it's just

758
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:23,299
gonna be you know Tom Hardy verse

759
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,690
carnage universe carnage only outside of

760
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,169
the MCU I'm not sure if it's you know

761
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:33,409
gonna new director please I'm not sure

762
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:35,059
if it'll work basically is what I'm

763
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:42,019
saying would you like to see is equally

764
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,470
the CGI stubbly the same damn thing with

765
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,360
it with instead of a muscular big one

766
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,340
he's fighting a skinny big one that can

767
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,860
form into things you need the spider-man

768
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,139
angle you need the hero working with

769
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:55,009
antihero

770
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,809
kind of thing but they've already kind

771
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,730
of spoiled that it's just arrow working

772
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,679
with arrow now basically yeah alright

773
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:05,659
venom is out we don't know if this is

774
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:08,090
gonna go anywhere I'd really wanted it

775
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,619
to be better so that Marvel would

776
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,409
integrate it with the MCU and do that

777
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:14,629
that dream scene where venom meets

778
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,429
spider-man and he sees him and he mimics

779
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:18,710
him and boom there comes the logo you

780
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,869
know hey I'm not gonna I don't know

781
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:22,909
that's gonna happen now I can't keep it

782
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:31,369
up ah now discard I know it was so bad I

783
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,740
mean I kind of I think woody harrelson

784
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,450
is kind of perfect to play the role of

785
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,240
the crazed carnage but he just looked

786
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,450
weird I wait I don't know I don't even

787
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,369
know if he's perfect it almost feels

788
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:48,950
like sequel baiting it's the hardest way

789
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,600
they can and they're not really serious

790
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,690
about making woody harrelson carnage in

791
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,779
the next film they're just they're not I

792
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:58,610
guess they are but like that oh shit

793
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,210
babe

794
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,360
