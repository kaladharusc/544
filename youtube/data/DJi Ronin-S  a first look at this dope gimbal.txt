1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,589
okay

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,809
I think I got it it's taken me like 25

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,309
minutes to figure out that effect in

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,450
fact I've had a Pete Evan Lestat we've

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,590
all been trying to figure that ox it's

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,779
like this mean that I saw on Twitter God

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,390
look how good hers is ready it's funny

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,630
every single time differences that's

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,689
real do you think that's real magic do

10
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,099
you think that mine is as funny of that

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,050
no you can be honest look good no

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,010
comment the whole scene is okay welcome

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,370

[Music]

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,750
okay so I don't know if you know Evans

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,820
channel or not you should if you don't

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,550
I'll link it below but great very smart

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,570
channel and we were just having a

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,869
conversation about editing like editing

20
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,360
videos with y'all what the hell are we

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,060
saying just how editing is really yeah

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,590
we were talking about outsourcing like I

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,509
had my managers are constantly asking me

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,460
to outsource parts of my show so that I

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,409
can free up time to be more productive

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,960
with other things and I just can't

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,140
possibly see how that would work and

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,750
I've tried like people always say when I

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,850
bitch about how busy I am everyone's

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,039
always like get an editor yeah get an

31
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,720
editor I tried or people are like cool

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,789
that Dan edits to your videos Dan that's

33
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,340
what I thought I thought he edited a

34
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,479
incredibly talented but he doesn't come

35
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,890
anywhere near these edits

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,539
sometimes he color corrects me doesn't

37
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,450
do the edits and of the 800 videos I

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,640
have in my channel I've yet to find

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,610
somebody who can edit my voice yeah

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,399
literally the milliseconds between two

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,470
lines in a voiceover I am spending

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,080
probably 15 minutes moving that audio

43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,869
file like zooming in all the way and

44
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,789
moving it just a tiny little bit playing

45
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,709
it over and saying is that pause enough

46
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,869
to get to jump it into the next thing is

47
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,940
the momentum the right way like I can't

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,340
imagine anyone anyone because that's

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,770
your brain yeah it's very frustrating

50
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,900
when you see comments and notes where

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,670
people are so dismissive of editing as

52
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,440
if it's like putting gasoline in your

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,200
car like it's an objective process or a

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,500
mechanical process the art is in the

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,319
Edit and the fun is in the Edit - I

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,110
don't agree with that well I mean I know

57
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,700
like I enter like a flow State in

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,580
editing it's when you finish the Edit

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,620
there's nothing more satisfying yeah and

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,480
there's nothing more disturbing than

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,000
realizing you haven't eaten for 13 hours

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,230
okay Evan in Casey discuss editing

63

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,660
hello and welcome to tech review Tuesday

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,640
tech review Tuesday were and I review a

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
piece of technology that I'm interested

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,630
in or curious about and share my

68
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,010
findings with you on this week's episode

69
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm going to be reviewing the new DJI

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,950
Ronin s video stabilizer but before I do

71
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,959
that I wanted to share with you some

72
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,940
technology that I think is really really

73
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,709
cool I'm not going to review I just want

74
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,380
to just want to show you this this is

75
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,570
made by a small company out of Detroit

76
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,030
called shinola and what's cool about

77
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,520
this company shinola the company was

78
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,250
started when all of the auto workers in

79
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,230
Detroit were losing their jobs and this

80
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,520
company was started to put all those

81
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,980
like skilled workers to work making

82
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,600
other things in addition to making

83
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,420
watches and handbags and all that stuff

84
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,180
they made they did a super super limited

85
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,280
edition run they made 500 of these

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,670
things this is a proper turntable like a

87
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,070
record player

88
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,110
shinola as we were sort of building out

89
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,790
what the audio system should be down at

90
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,310
368 I was like I was like let's use this

91
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,470
handmade american-made Detroit made and

92
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,480
turntable I don't know record players

93
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,459
but this is just the bit that sits on it

94
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,419
this probably weighs like 20 pounds this

95
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,800
is like a piece of jewelry Wow

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:51,880
[Music]

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,260
[Laughter]

98
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,870
[Music]

99
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,580
now I'm no audiophile

100
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,949
I'm not like one of those music guys but

101
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,340
the audio difference from like something

102
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,380
like this like an actual record with

103
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,570
high quality speakers versus like I

104
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,090
usually do like ear pods and Spotify

105
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,330
myself the sound quality is unbelievably

106
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:24,199
different okay so now for the tech

107
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,570
review part of tech review Tuesday this

108
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,949
is the Ronin s the roving 2's is a a

109
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:33,470
gimbal for SLR cameras made by DJI the

110
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,300
same company that makes all the drones

111
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,169
that I and everybody else the world uses

112
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,699
designed is the all-in-one workhorse for

113
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,860
almost any type of filmic Ronin s is

114
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,080
packed with incredible features that

115
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,850
offer the ultimate flexibility for

116
00:05:46,850 --> 00:06:02,000
single or multiple operators on any set

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:13,949
[Music]

118
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,290
a 3-axis gimbal is basically a mechanism

119
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,900
to make sure a camera stays steady as

120
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,110
it's recording as it's moving this is a

121
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,720
three axis gimbal by GoPro and see in

122
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,970
theory anyways no matter how much I move

123
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,310
this handle the camera stays in sort of

124
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,650
the same position this right here this

125
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,090
is a gimbal on the bottom of a drone

126
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,310
same idea you put the camera here no

127
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,810
matter how you move your hand it stays

128
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,639
in one position what was typically used

129
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,770
for stabilizers for bigger cameras or

130
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,660
something like this this is a really

131
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,000
fantastic device made by movi you put

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,070
the you put a camera down here and then

133
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,600
no matter how you move this thing it

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,360
stays stable amazing device this is how

135
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,220
I shot the snowboarding in New York City

136
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,680
movie and the Aladdin video was with

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,750
this bad boy but it's a little bit big a

138
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,729
little unruly you have to actually have

139
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,460
a stand just to put the thing down from

140
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,350
where I gathered the Ronin s is kind of

141
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,900
the answer to all of that it's a small

142
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,960
handheld stabilizer that does what the

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,850
big one that does what the big one does

144
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,620
but is the size of one of the smaller

145
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:32,419
more miniaturized gimbals

146
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,669
it

147
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,710
totally Crittenden let's do this so was

148
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:48,539
lovin right so this thing does a lot

149
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,490
more features than what we're playing

150
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,129
with it for today there's an app that

151
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,659
works with it that you can program you

152
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,069
to really complicated time lapse

153
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,800
features the Ronin s app complements the

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,840
gimbal giving filmmakers even greater

155
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,219
control over their creativity wherever

156
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,139
your passion takes you I've only used it

157
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,969
for about fifteen minutes it feels super

158
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,740
simple how's your arm

159
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,779
I mean it's heavy it is heavy it takes

160
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,300
one hand you can definitely operate it

161
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,340
with one hand there is something I liked

162
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,439
about it which is the you can have a

163
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,199
microphone on this like I do here and

164
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,360
still have it work on the gimbal and

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,479
still be as stable as can be which is

166
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,379
pretty amazing

167
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,090
oh the selfie mode is really good too

168
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,800
like your gorilla pod I mean you have a

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,269
really good grip on it so you have

170
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,800
stable shots but all you have to do is

171
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,390
hold that thing you'll get really stable

172
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,669
yeah if you're like a sociopath when it

173
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,820
comes to making vlogs you could shoot

174
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,159
this all of your vlogs on something like

175
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
this like look this is me using this as

176
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
if it's a selfie stick slip on you have

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
to have strong forearms this thing about

178
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,850
double the weight doubles the weight of

179
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,970
the camera but it is amazing that this

180
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,070
replaces such a gigantic piece of

181
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,600
hardware alright so we do some shots

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,220
through the trees now yeah let's

183
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,510
some cinema

184
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:24,120

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,410
oh okay that concludes the first look of

186
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,770
the Ronin s3 accent three axis

187
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,650
stabilizer huge fat thumbs up take it

188
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,240
for what it's worth though because we've

189
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,310
only had three hours with this issue

190
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,200
just starting to play with it so far

191
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,320
very impressed I do want to flag that I

192
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,100
I have a plan to shoot an entire episode

193
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,810
of three six eight using just this

194
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,870
gimbal to give it right to give like a

195
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,850
really comprehensive review of all the

196
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,470
details and all the features that this

197
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,410
thing does

198
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,850
that'll come soon for now though

199
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,660
