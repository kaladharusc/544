1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:13,280
50 seconds of logos also Comcast

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,480
extremely CGI Bertus or well it's not a

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,859
Jurassic Park movie if there's not a kid

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,449
obsessed with Dinosaurs just once I want

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,560
to see how a kid obsessed with Star Trek

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,910
fares on an island full of Dino

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,010
predators also viewmaster foreshadowing

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,330
Judy Greer doesn't have a bigger role in

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,550
the sea wholly it's the kid Tony Stark

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,539
gave all those gifts do

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,550
no wonder he's a daydreamer but let's be

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,899
honest at least his home life turned

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,640
around am i right I mean he's got his

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,750
own room now instead of having to sneak

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,329
off to the garage looks like beets

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,680
product placement has even infiltrated

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,910
the Tony Bennett music videos

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,289
apparently the public is warmed to the

19
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,910
idea of a huge dinosaur amusement park

20
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,989
but it's still one you have to take a

21
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,340
flight to Costa Rica and a ferry to

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,719
another Island to see with names like

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,190
Zack and gray I know for sure I'm not

24
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,720
gonna like these kids Jurassic tennis

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,860
Daniel the music for this scene is so

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,200
obvious they stole our outtake welcome

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,020
to Jurassic world roll credits let's be

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,570
honest no one's impressed by a dinosaur

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,790
anymore tell that to the viewers that

30
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,800
made this 2015's biggest hit also

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,300
Jurassic world steals the same reason

32
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,800
Monsters Inc is in business to justify

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,510
the block how did you get two different

34
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,370
kinds of dinosaurs - you know oh

35
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,700
indominus wasn't bred she was designed

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,370
blah blah blah no one asked you BD Wong

37
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,750
I'm sure Ron Howard's daughter could

38
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,260
have told him that

39
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,610
but hey glad you could make it to the

40
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,900
Jurassic come back you didn't miss much

41
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,400
between is there somebody who comes back

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,900
it covers this stuff in dirt every 10

43
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,340
minutes or so or is this some sort of

44
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,869
exclusive archeological dig but these

45
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,820
kids won't in a contest that first part

46
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,430
was legit movie acknowledges the first

47
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,900
films of Vince's cannon but this new

48
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,520
park was still somehow built you close

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,040
the deal looks like it the rise in

50
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Wireless presents the indominus rex

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
movie truck full of product placements

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
makes fun of brand deals so that

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,860
Hollywood will see more like people

54
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,119
you're not even looking at her dude and

55
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,450
that it tried to break the glass but

56
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,640
only the one time and never again sits

57
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,350
because while it's a smart dinosaur it's

58
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,729
actually quite stupid you see we've been

59
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,020
taught that Raptors are so insanely

60
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,490
smart they can figure out puzzles and

61
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,410
attack and patterns but apparently with

62
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,700
enough gung-ho attitude you can train

63
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,980
them to be your bitches I just saw a

64
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,930
bond a real bond

65
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,700
it's just in Chris Pratt is the new bomb

66
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,530
we know that the military needs to

67
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,900
reduce casualties introducing probably

68
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,370
the worst part of this movie the already

69
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,720
super villain company hoping to recruit

70
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,430
these animals for war purposes but what

71
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,630
do they need these dinosaurs for when

72
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,370
they have the t-virus or am i confusing

73
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,140
my movies again also only fill military

74
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,030
is using Raptors to fight wars don't

75
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,740
other militaries just decide to bomb the

76
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,450
living out of such a fighting force you

77
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,740
don't send dudes on the ground to fight

78
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,690
Raptors right drones can't search

79
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,140
tunnels and caves and their hackable the

80
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,880
minute a real war breaks out all that

81
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,069
fancy tech is gonna go dark so better

82
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,750
bank on velociraptors makes perfect

83
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,780
sense let's see things are getting

84
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,220
boring and we need an action scene let's

85
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,900
have this guy be an F that is job also

86
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,610
is a loose pig really that urgent a

87
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,380
problem what the pigs only here to

88
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,690
service food for the dinosaurs anyway

89
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,599
okay

90
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm pretty sure there's a 95% chance he

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,170
would be eaten here but with the evil

92
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,459
military guy in here these Raptors are

93
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,599
going to do everything in their power to

94
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,159
move that plop forward and they try and

95
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,420
eat him as soon as he moves for the

96
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,890
safety of the gate but later they'll be

97
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,180
running alongside his motorcycle not

98
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,370
chomping on his delicious face don't

99
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,840
ever turn your back to the cage which is

100
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,430
what I'm gonna do right now I know this

101
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,200
is Costa Rica where laws may be more

102
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,340
lacks but this is just an insurance

103
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,079
fucking nightmare this Park again how

104
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,549
did it ever get built even out of the

105
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,680
u.s. they're gonna be sued 2500 times a

106
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,269
year at a minimum they cover up the dork

107
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,189
pouch interestingly this is also how

108
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,140
kangaroos mock their dirty siblings this

109
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,760
place sells Dino balloons with almost no

110
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,989
helium in them so they appeared to be

111
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,250
walking on the ground which means they

112
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,870
lose what little helium they have very

113
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,340
quickly and are just an overpriced brief

114
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,599
waste of time at least if you buy the

115
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,859
pterodactyl balloon it comes with full

116
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,480
helium out of the box am I supposed to

117
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,310
laugh or wince at this Jurassic world

118
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,530
the theme park feels half parody of the

119
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,909
over commercialization of Disney and

120
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,859
other theme parks and half actually what

121
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,540
would happen in this movies reality

122
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,620
expects me to believe that only this one

123
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,180
child is running for the t-rex exhibit

124
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,989
after that announcement

125
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,150
do you even kid screenwriter Wow a cell

126
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,650
phone reception is excellent on a remote

127
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,150
Costa Rican island I went to Montana

128
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,379
last summer and found how t-mobile

129
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,940
doesn't have any service in that state

130
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,709
like at all but the Costa Rican ocean

131
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,109
King blanketed in cell coverage this was

132
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,970
supposed to be a family weekend Claire

133
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,859
skipped there's apparently no such thing

134
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,120
as calling a guy on the phone when it

135
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,829
comes to asking for his help nope we

136
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,150
need a full scene of chris pratt

137
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,440
exerting his male dominance over the

138
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,090
alpha female also I wonder how much

139
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,650
Jurassic world paper Sadie's to slide

140
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,970
this movie into their car commercial

141
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,520
made what Owens nickname must be Daniel

142
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,380
son did this movie just have its jock he

143
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,510
wrote it to fly in midair Jesus I don't

144
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,030
control the Raptors it's a relationship

145
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,710
it's bull whatever label you want to put

146
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,510
on it dude that's right you and I never

147
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,010
had a second date why is it every time

148
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,300
there's a woman who needs to find some

149
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,830
man for a job in movies they've dated

150
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,659
before you might want to change your

151
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:52,710
shirt they're very sensitive to smell

152
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,690
way to get back at him for all that

153
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,729
sexist dialogue - it's I mean this is

154
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,050
the 30s right I can get away with

155
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,520
calling her that only the first Rover -

156
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,180
God slickers

157
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,680
even though roughly 32 rows were

158
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,669
drenched by the Moses or spirit

159
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,969
pre-booking tickets for months okay what

160
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:08,979
you waited until now to seek an expert's

161
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,080
opinion on the pack and also this is the

162
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,189
first anyone's hearing about it on the

163
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,300
island even though it's been public

164
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,349
knowledge on the mainland for three

165
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,840
months the base genome is a t-rex the

166
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,439
rest is classified you might as well say

167
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,930
Raptor then or lie also how can you ask

168
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,340
a dude to evaluate the prospective

169
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,840
worthiness of a Dino paddock without

170
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,009
telling him what he's dealing with I

171
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,180
know we're supposed to understand that

172
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,979
engine hires these lacks lazy security

173
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,509
guards because they don't give a but

174
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,999
come on it's just piling on with

175
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:37,689
siblings they learned social skills and

176
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,400
I am print on them when they're born and

177
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,750
now I'm picturing that creepy Twilight

178
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,710
baby thank you

179
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,090
also we just heard that the indominus

180
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,949
was born with a sibling she ate it

181
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,719
so all this smart talk by Owen to make

182
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:47,680
him look like the world's foremost

183
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,509
authority on Dino psychology and shame

184
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:50,949
the company for their misdeeds comes off

185
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,360
just a little Hollow when we know that

186
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,159
plus she never tells Owen this for some

187
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,479
reason Claire gets in the car and call

188
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,400
HQ about tracking the indominus instead

189
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,479
of doing that before we're leaving the

190
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,830
paddock remember this thing could be

191
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,659
anywhere including the parking lot also

192
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,159
we can show how deaf this new dinosaur

193
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,300
is and so she can't relay the

194
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,889
information in time to Owen who stupidly

195
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,300
goes inside the cage when you think

196
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,560
about it this is just the indominus his

197
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,550
protest against Jurassic Park 3 Radio

198
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,659
crafts out right when they need it to

199
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,279
work and despite the excellent cell

200
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,839
phone coverage demonstrated earlier like

201
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,250
all doors in these movies they close

202
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,689
with the speed of a vic-20 computer

203
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,159
meanwhile you have a SeaWorld attraction

204
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,389
at your park where you can lower a whole

205
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,649
stadium of people in way less time

206
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,539
plenty at the street the guy who got out

207
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,919
of the paddock first decided I'll hide

208
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,509
in front of my truck instead of you know

209
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:29,800
getting in the truck and driving away

210
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,849
that's what you get for eating

211
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,289
sandwiches on the job it's amazing

212
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,610
engine thought this dinosaur would be

213
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,689
their business Savior when it's

214
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,399
basically just t-rex to the Rex inning

215
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,960
my watch came at me with a steak knife

216
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,729
took a chunk in her do you get the sense

217
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:43,930
Vincent D'Onofrio invented this

218
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,399
backstory about raising a wolf pup

219
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,050
strictly first character amazing the guy

220
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,580
who wants to use Raptors for war has

221
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,259
this convenient history affair yep this

222
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,029
also looks like a serious death risk for

223
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,710
the park visitors but control systems

224
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,819
are in place to keep this herd from

225
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,699
knocking over the truck of course or one

226
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,979
of us be with mommy annoyed dad gives it

227
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,050
in fact who gives it about these kids at

228
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,490
least Lexington were part of the action

229
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,000
from the get-go

230
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
these kids were dropped off by a Z rated

231
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,789
babysitter and they offer nothing

232
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,589
absolutely nothing to this movie

233
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,879
which happens Dan's leave no need to be

234
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,020
a pussy about it look

235
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,370
they're gonna get to everything right

236
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,470
you're gonna get two birthdays two

237
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,819
Thanksgivings to accept parents right

238
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,620
how do you not shut down all attractions

239
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,150
an issue an evacuation order with a

240
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,949
genetically enhanced hybrid t-rex on the

241
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:27,370
loose

242
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,979
I made a sea of bears that the elevator

243
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,509
even allow him on this floor you know

244
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:32,680
you can make elevators do amazing things

245
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,270
these days right including keeping out

246
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,159
unauthorized personnel she marked up

247
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,050
that wall as a distraction she wanted us

248
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,270
to think she escaped and she knew that

249
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,620
you had cameras that detected thermal

250
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,000
signatures and somehow knew she needed

251
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,199
to reduce her body temperature so she

252
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,430
couldn't be detected I know when I was

253
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,509
born I already had the theory of

254
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,669
calculus down pat so that's legit I'm

255
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,130
going after her with non-lethal we have

256
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,470
26 million dollars invested in that

257
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,030
asset who he steals the polarizer from

258
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,099
aliens that's her tracking implant she

259
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,159
plotted out how would it know to do that

260
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,259
she remembered where they put it in and

261
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,639
she knew exactly what it was apparently

262
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,960
they're putting something in my body

263
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,740
must be a way to track me it's kind of

264
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,340
cool actually

265
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,960
but this is the last time this really

266
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
smart dinosaur does anything cool the

267
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,629
rest of the movie all it becomes after

268
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,449
this is a remorseless eating machine

269
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,460
evacuate the island we'd never reopen oh

270
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,409
okay then keep it open

271
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,180
dinosaur nerd kid cliche bumps up

272
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,169
against older brother who's only

273
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,580
interested in girls cliche and I'm

274
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,900
honestly actively rooting for both these

275
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,969
dickheads to die so they're if their

276
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,279
genetic code was pure many of them would

277
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,599
look quite different but take that

278
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,159
people who nitpick Jurassic Park on the

279
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,599
look of the dinosaurs shame on you and

280
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,950
the Pickers shame Jimmy felt no we can

281
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,050
stay out a couple more minutes

282
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,010
dinosaur amusement park allows rides

283
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,270
that can be personally controlled by

284
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,970
teenagers they made these where there's

285
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,350
no communication available other than

286
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,610
your own cell phones it's almost like

287
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,870
engine was writing a screenplay when

288
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,790
they made these things now I'm just

289
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,750
worried that you're not getting the full

290
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,630
Jurassic world experience amazing on the

291
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,829
day that Claire's nephews came to the

292
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,690
park that's when all that went down and

293
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,950
they're assholes too which makes it even

294
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,589
more fun there's five dinosaurs aren't

295
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,329
you supposed to be a genius or something

296
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,339
yeah genius if you see five dinosaurs

297
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,570
including one that looks like the t-rex

298
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,310
got dipped in x-men mutagen why are you

299
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,810
being so goddamn vague and calm about it

300
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,790
also indominus rex his path manages to

301
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,750
go exactly where the people were

302
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,190
supposed to care about go the phone call

303
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,480
intended to help save the kids actually

304
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,220
puts the kids in further danger this

305
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,030
happened in the last movie

306
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,560
when he thinks that I will experience

307
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,300
satisfactory thrills if it literally

308
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,710
repeats the first movies kids in peril

309
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,970
scene but with a change from night to

310
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,290
day and two boys instead of a

311
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,940
brother-sister indominus managed to miss

312
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,440
two kids with what is basically a huge

313
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,340
jacket piece of glass at this point

314
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,870
thank God dinosaurs hate water the baby

315
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,370
Donnell from American sniper thinks this

316
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,590
looks fake as it didn't eat him it's

317
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,900
killing for sport and that my friends is

318
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,160
how a dinosaur gets more character than

319
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,390
all the humans in this movie would love

320
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,070
a situation here is this guy really been

321
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,330
tracking hoskins movements this whole

322
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,860
time when he's not training Raptors is

323
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,210
he this Islands official Coast Guard or

324
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:04,990
something know anything about dinosaurs

325
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:14,930
stay here stay here stay here Jurassic

326
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,400
world is so concerned it's not paying

327
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,050
enough respect at Jurassic Park it puts

328
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,280
in a whole scene paying respect to

329
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,170
Jurassic Park you only fixed up

330
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,210
grandpa's old Malibu right ah sudden car

331
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,920
savviness even before the Dino breakout

332
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,960
this park is clearly over capacity that

333
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,820
thing is a killing machine he's talking

334
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,470
about indominus rex but he could just as

335
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,790
easily be talking about Hoskins diet

336
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,610
they'll take this stronger than me just

337
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,900
goes to show guys if you've been an

338
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,040
asshole to your brother all your life

339
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
all it takes is an indominus rex attack

340
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,100
to set yourself straight once again the

341
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,570
indominus finds its way around the main

342
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,800
characters but all we've been hearing

343
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,330
about is how it's making a beeline south

344
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,040
towards the park this is not too far

345
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,480
from where we lost our when she was

346
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,920
attacking those two kids before they ran

347
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,310
here

348
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,630
so I guess despite the fact she's

349
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,980
currently moving south she's doing it in

350
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,110
a zigzaggy east-west motion dinosaur we

351
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,370
know has knowledge of thermal radiation

352
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,870
and tracking devices didn't bother

353
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,530
taking Owens gun on the way out yeah I

354
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,210
remember that scene well I mean we have

355
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,589
to acknowledge that the indominus isn't

356
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,150
that big a target so even the best of us

357
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,440
could miss something like this hey I

358
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
have an idea about how we can get to the

359
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,110
silly plot line with Hoskins and the war

360
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,700
Raptors let's have the owner of engine

361
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,050
fly us helicopter make absolutely no

362
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,860
impact on the plot crash and die okay

363
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,300
safe now why would you say this tear

364
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,890
Demick movie leaves behind the two

365
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,210
brothers for a bit so we can experience

366
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,440
true horror and seen her future

367
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,850
nightmares by traveling along with this

368
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,320
chick as she gets repeatedly captured

369
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,820
tortured and eaten by flying dinosaurs

370
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,680
also a lot of you love the scene and I

371
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,060
don't know if I blame you but for the

372
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,500
very fact that Zara never once was a

373
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,820
character in this movie merely playing

374
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,620
an occasional cutaway shot the impact

375
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,790
this scene could have had is lost

376
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,170
because she's really not much above an

377
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,040
extra in this movie

378
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,120
something sharp crashes towards

379
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,410
characters and comes to a complete stop

380
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,350
at the last second cliche this is a good

381
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,750
time to do that he has this insane plan

382
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,960
to use the laughter you mean the giant

383
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,550
genetically enhanced dinosaur we haven't

384
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,810
seen or heard from in almost 20 minutes

385
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,850
of screen time I know Hoskins is insane

386
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,230
so maybe sending the fact that he thinks

387
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,610
this is going to work is ridiculous in

388
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,170
itself but the guy saw Owen control the

389
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,520
raptors one time from an elevated

390
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,200
position and suddenly that equals now we

391
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
can use the raptors to fight indominus I

392
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,290
think even insane people would need more

393
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,950
data this is happening with or without

394
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,140
you so the release of the raptors into

395
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,460
the open is happening with or without

396
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,200
the only guy who can somewhat control

397
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,460
them the statement might be the dumbest

398
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,990
thing in this entire movie empty threat

399
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,210
is empty Owen has all the power here do

400
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,610
that ghost at the old house you mean the

401
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,600
one that made him go into the further

402
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
probably not also movie hints at a much

403
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,140
better movie we will sadly never see

404
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,820
luckily the indominus somehow knowing

405
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,260
she had a tracking device lodged in its

406
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,490
skin and tearing it out becomes a

407
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,630
convenient way for the raptors to

408
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,070
ironically track her the old-fashioned

409
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,690
way also at what point did they get this

410
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,920
patch of skin with the tracker back

411
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,540
remember when the soldiers found it this

412
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,860
guy was holding it got thrown to the

413
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,630
water and stopped so I guess they sent

414
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,070
people on a mission to go recover that

415
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,480
piece of flesh and the only way they

416
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,860
could find it the tracker remained

417
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,630
miraculously intact so the big final

418
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,130
plan is for the raptors to lead the way

419
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,480
to indominus followed by owen on a

420
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,830
motorcycle french dude on a four-wheeler

421
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,840
and the kids and girl they're trying to

422
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,430
protect in the van that follows these

423
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,750
raptors somehow race toward this

424
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,950
indominus as though they thought the

425
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,000
four of them could defeat it but now

426
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,050
that they're facing it they're like oh

427
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,020
dude but we think it they communicating

428
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,270
yeah but doesn't the indominus have zero

429
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,950
social skills wasn't that the reason it

430
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,630
became a murdering psychopath so the

431
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,920
raptors just instantly fall in line with

432
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,330
this thing because it's big and it

433
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,950
speaks raptor movie turns into Tarak

434
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,810
evolution what is your way call it a

435
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,520
chopper I'm not sure why I only thought

436
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,500
of this now but just do it

437
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,810
we'd like to thank you for your patience

438
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,340
while many of you were being killed

439
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,190
someone has to stay behind they do what

440
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,970
have you done to this point that

441
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,740
requires your presence sure you get your

442
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,120
big moment later when you open the t-rex

443
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
paddock that's about it

444
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,610
nature is to kick well I'm glad to see

445
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,750
him get his comeuppance especially at

446
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,520
the hands of a raptor but deep blue sea

447
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,630
called and they'd like their character

448
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,890
suddenly killed during a big speech back

449
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,720
also random Raptor shows up on the scene

450
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,890
apparently knowing the layout of the lab

451
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,510
to run straight to this room interrupts

452
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,130
Hoskins mid monologue knows who the bad

453
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,600
guy this movie is and goes straight for

454
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,130
now they're blocked on both sides by

455
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,600
Raptors when the end looks near which

456
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,340
means the heretofore unseen t-rex is

457
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,480
going to save the day because we're

458
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,890
paralleling the first movie hard here

459
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,500
people goddamnit

460
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,360
a minute ago you guys said goin I love

461
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,830
the indominus now now that only takes

462
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,910
your harnesses off you suddenly switch

463
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,350
sides for no real apparent reason other

464
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,990
than Raptor style junk

465
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,640
why did you specifically radio for Lowry

466
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,080
did you know that the slacker game is

467
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,220
going to be the one person to stay

468
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,640
behind

469
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,440
is this a Marvel movie now we once again

470
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,940
going to see something fight at slightly

471
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,340
bigger twin um she cannot outrun a t-rex

472
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,780
remember the first movie when they're in

473
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,640
the Jeep must go faster Jeff Goldblum's

474
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,350
torso I thought y'all were kidding about

475
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,200
the heels but goddamn

476
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
what you mean you're not gonna try and

477
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,440
get her on your side thankfully the

478
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,940
t-rex they released is more interested

479
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,020
in killing genetically enhanced

480
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,460
dinosaurs than it is in killing humans

481
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,530
this thing come from I thought all the

482
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,180
Raptors were dead Raptor X market I

483
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,160
guess everywhere these assholes roam the

484
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,420
fight follows them this is an awesome

485
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,010
head Nick but how did the underwater

486
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,390
thing know that the indominus thing was

487
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,620
right here at this moment doing

488
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,740
indominus things t rex raptor diplomacy

489
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,330
why do we just assume that because the

490
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,890
indominus is dead all the danger is over

491
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,540
now there are loose animals all over the

492
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,100
park but i guess after the t-rex and the

493
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,450
raptor had their heart-to-heart all the
