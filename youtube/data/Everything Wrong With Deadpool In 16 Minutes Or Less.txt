1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,139
hey guys if you're not gonna consider

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,550
any movie you make away from Disney a

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,719
part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,219
you could at least spare us the 12

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,960
second comic-book flipy logo for once

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,730
this critic plays a lot differently in

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,080
hindsight after Tim Miller was either

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,550
fired or encouraged to quit the sequel

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,080
Ryan Reynolds tries to claim a crown

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,699
that clearly would first belong to me

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,529
Kevin James al Sharpton Dax Shepard

12
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,210
Norman Ahnold and at least one famous

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,039
YouTube prank channel personality get in

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,449
line dude movie acknowledges the

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,099
existence of Ryan Reynolds in this world

16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,480
so how come Wade Wilson doesn't

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,860
constantly get barage by autograph

18
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,329
hounds and paparazzi when he is so

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,100
clearly Ryan Reynolds it's amazing any

20
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,899
movie can be released in 2016 and

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,850
feature only long moody teen flat-out

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,649
incredible this movie finally calls out

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,390
the Stan Lee cameos and yet still

24
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,950
features occur to it as Stan Lee cameo

25
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,450
this is funny because it feels like

26
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,070
Deadpool got one over on the studio

27
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,050
execs but the truth is the studio execs

28
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,210
100% definitely saw and signed off on

29
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,649
this joke which only makes their

30
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:56,969
everyday ass hattery all the more

31
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,680
infuriating since they know about it

32
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,090
not once during this entire movie does

33
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,530
Deadpool comment on or complain about

34
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,120
the weird mask nipple that forms at the

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,199
back of his head when he wears this

36
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,330
thing but I will know my slender Brown

37
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,310
friend that's kinda racist what does

38
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,520
miss mama June taste like like two hobos

39
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,830
in a shoe how do two hobos that want to

40
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,509
each other even decide a shoe is the

41
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,860
perfect setting and how do they fit into

42
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
a shoe we've taken a weird hard turn

43
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,220
into a discussion of hobo geometry and

44
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,810
smell anomic s-- is that an adventure

45
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,549
time watch Jesus pander to the Nerds

46
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,110
much also reference that will be

47
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,520
outdated and downright lost to time

48
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
within a few short years cliche okay

49
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,970
this is disfigure MIT for sure but it's

50
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,200
not like no one could ever love him

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,729
level disfigurement it's all he's Eric

52
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,829
Stoltz and masks the movie strange as it

53
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,270
is to say out loud doesn't go far enough

54
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,619
and ugly enough Wade Wilson

55
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,909
the director said let's have your bad

56
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,439
guy eat an apple it'll make cinemasins

57
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,060
think you're even more of an asshole did

58
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,100
you or did the movie make you forget in

59
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,600
order to conform to budget hey don't

60
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,220
hate the messenger I love this movie but

61
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,840
this is only the first of a couple major

62
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,220
action scenes affected by the film's

63
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,180
budget working

64
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,950
stiffing a caddy Deadpool waits

65
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,600
patiently for the convoy of bad guys to

66
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,250
show up but how did he know they'd even

67
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,170
take this route or which vehicles to

68
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,210
look for whose balls did I have to

69
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,429
fondle to get my very own movie it does

70
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,190
rhyme with pull Vereen yeah but last I

71
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,450
checked Wolverine didn't have that much

72
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,230
clout at Fox

73
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,030
he's a VP of production in a moment he's

74
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,819
got a nice pair of smooth criminals

75
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,590
Ganon des making me mentally picture

76
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,030
Hugh Jackman's presumably shaved

77
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,500
testicles Oh

78
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,200
bad guys to kill bad guys decided to go

79
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,879
with the black SUVs complete with bad

80
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,409
guy motorcycles for easy bad guy

81
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,849
identification Deadpool leaves his

82
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,769
Walkman and his cassette copy of Shoop

83
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,269
both of which must be hard to come by in

84
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,549
2016 on the guardrail above as he dives

85
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,349
down for revenge I could kill my own man

86
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,239
but who cares I might get Deadpool too I

87
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,650
see the director learned a thing or two

88
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,480
at the Michael Bay Zack Snyder symposium

89
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,099
for the construction of the scene did I

90
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,290
leave the stove on this is hilarious but

91
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,879
he's clearly moving at full speed to say

92
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,110
this line even though the entire

93
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,489
everything around him is in slow motion

94
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,560
also Deadpool tells hacky did I leave

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,879
the stove on joke in the middle of this

96
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,680
action scene and oh yeah I almost forgot

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
the scene does not contain a lap dance

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,650
not one of these trailing cars goes

99
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,180
around this wrecked SUV and continues

100
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,500
about their day which every American

101
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,849
knows at least one of these Booker's

102
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,650
would do gridlock has kept police from

103
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,510
the scene movie suggests cops in this

104
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,310
town don't have helicopters and take 20

105
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,569
minutes to get through basic gridlock

106
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,489
and movie is tripping balls this movie

107
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,109
will make a joke about this later about

108
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:17,639
how they couldn't afford any more x-men

109
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,440
to be at the mansion but doesn't have

110
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,819
hired some extras to pretend like this

111
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,099
mansion is full also is Colossus always

112
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,750
in metal form I knew he had the power to

113
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,280
do this but he decides to be this way

114
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,599
even when he's eating cereal okay

115
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,190
remember gridlock it's what's keeping

116
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,930
police from arriving on the scene even

117
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,099
though there is nothing on the other

118
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,690
side of the crashed SUV there is

119
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,280
literally all the room in the world over

120
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,389
there for cops to be approaching the

121
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,190
scene yeah it's a one-way road but even

122
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,690
cops break that rule when she was going

123
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,840
down he wore the brown pants

124
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
how can Deadpool see which guy he's

125
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,109
pointing out from behind this car I only

126
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,150
have 12 bullets so you're gonna have to

127
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,680
share let's count them down worth it

128
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,630
Deadpool hilariously wastes 2/3 of his

129
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,340
remaining bullets and okay fine it's

130
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,660
funny but then he Luck's out more than

131
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,280
almost any movie character in history by

132
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,569
having that last three henchmen line up

133
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,129
perfectly of their own accord so

134
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,780
Deadpool single remaining bullet could

135
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,250
still wipe out the opposition he didn't

136
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,540
know they were gonna do that and yeah

137
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm sure he's an unkillable reheating

138
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,180
bastard who would have found some other

139
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,530
way to kill the henchmen that's not the

140
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,090
point dammit the bullet wasting is the

141
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,859
point can't act like that matters by

142
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,209
counting it down for style points and

143
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,949
then cheat in the end this is cool but

144
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:17,519
bullshit

145
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,889
cool how the ever letting does this guy

146
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,479
think Deadpool's behind a car right now

147
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,039
how did he miss the gunfight between the

148
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,840
motorcycle guy and him here our hero

149
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,880
uses the 1990s gangster flick method

150
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,110
turning his gun to the side which

151
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,670
everyone knows is bull and makes it

152
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,710
harder to hit your target also oh look a

153
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,300
bullet can't penetrate three schools in

154
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,520
one shot only 2.5 giving Deadpool

155
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
another non Francis person to have to

156
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,030
take out you're probably thinking my

157
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,350
boyfriend said this was a superhero

158
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,000
movie but that guy in the red suit just

159
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,460
turned that other guy into a kebab no

160
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,050
actually I didn't bring my boyfriend to

161
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,520
this feature pool your narration is

162
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,170
narrow to the point that maybe only 1%

163
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,730
of the entire audience actually even

164
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,810
came close to thinking what you just

165
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,780
said and who placed the call hey how did

166
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,250
this guy at his apartment not see weed

167
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,840
anywhere while he was here did he just

168
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,340
get home if so it's kind of lucky he

169
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,690
didn't need to use the bathroom huh

170
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,270
Jeremy is it I'm not here for him I'm

171
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,790
here for you bubi names stalker pizza

172
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,740
Shane character after me and I'm equal

173
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,720
parts honored and insulted also ignoring

174
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,860
the fact that Wayde was able to figure

175
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,000
out that Jeremy would be the one

176
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,710
delivering this pizza this is an insane

177
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,360
way to confront it I mean why not find

178
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,140
out where he lives

179
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,370
we're tracking down outside the pizza

180
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,050
parlor instead he orders a pizza at

181
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,730
another guy's apartment I guess for the

182
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,890
comedic value you live in you 102 and

183
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,440
then die at the city of Detroit huh

184
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,090
what does that mean the Detroit live for

185
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,250
102 years and then die or is this just a

186
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,150
cheap Detroit joke I was molested me too

187
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,300
okay

188
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,030
uncles they took turns at some point

189
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,140
this movie got completely bass-ackwards

190
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,240
on the definition of wrong comedy versus

191
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,470
the definition of a couple steps too far

192
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,140
Hey that's no use skee-ball but isn't

193
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,400
there usually a window or something that

194
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,300
prevents you from throwing the ball

195
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,740
straight into a hole I love what this

196
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,940
movie is going form and I actually

197
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,560
totally buy the love between these two

198
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,150
but the amount of sex shown and the

199
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,650
length of time it goes on totally

200
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,240
unrealistic to any real relationship

201
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,470
I've ever known in real life this is

202
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,000
movie love where sex happens every six

203
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,340
hours it is an illusion only 15

204
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,080
year-olds believe in that and who was

205
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,880
this movie star good audience oh wait

206
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,590
Deadpool takes out Francis like a bitch

207
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,210
in the early scenes but the big final

208
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,800
climax thing will have you wondering why

209
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,300
Francis is able to hold his own for a

210
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,950
10-minute fight with Deadpool the losses

211
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,330
comes out of nowhere to stop Deadpool

212
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,250
from bashing Ajax's face in I don't know

213
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,600
how he flew that plane anywhere near the

214
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
highway or managed to walk down the

215
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,090
street without making any noise until

216
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,680
now but it certainly gives Deadpool more

217
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,540
time to flash back to tell a story we

218
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,780
both know that cancer is a show I'm

219
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,310
sorry I don't get leaving your lover

220
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,870
behind to try some experimental cancer

221
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,250
treatment and spare her pain

222
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,720
I really don't this feels like yet

223
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,740
another movie where someone does

224
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,240
something colossal II selfish and some

225
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,860
stupid attempt to protect someone they

226
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,570
love from emotions which is impossible

227
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,150
by the way Jack off

228
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,060
Smirnoff opening for the spin doctors at

229
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,330
the Iowa State Fair show Wow after the

230
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,010
limp Biskit joke in the wham joke all

231
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,390
Wade needs to reference now is

232
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,920
Nickelback and the easy pop-culture

233
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,210
punchline wheel of destiny can be

234
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,070
completed also why are you slamming the

235
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,140
Iowa State Fair it's off the hook

236
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,850
I understand you've recently been

237
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,280
diagnosed with terminal cancer so what

238
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,230
we do is a secret evil business is to

239
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,030
keep tabs on former soldiers who now

240
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,740
wrap up stalkers for a living they make

241
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,680
the best guinea pigs me three of those

242
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,900
movies some point you have to wonder if

243
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,310
he's just a bad parent

244
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,540
wait Wilson would be amazing at

245
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,370
cinemasins wait packs up and leaves in

246
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,300
the middle of the night like is the

247
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,100
goddamn Baltimore Colts what I also

248
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,750
don't get is how freely and cluelessly

249
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,100
Wade gives up all its rights as a human

250
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,900
being to a group that then tortures him

251
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,610
for months and maybe accidentally also

252
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,020
gives him powers I mean this is the

253
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,130
ultimate I didn't read the Terms of

254
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,290
Service example right wasn't talking to

255
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,900
you I was talking about movie misses the

256
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,040
opportunity to show a group of

257
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
schoolchildren just out of the cameras

258
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,920
view so that Deadpool's fourth wall

259
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,450
breaking could remain a little cheekier

260
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,960
than this hey deuce pool you're watching

261
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,370
Ajax manages to escape completely in the

262
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,510
short time it took for negasonic teenage

263
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,760
warhead and Deadpool to insult Sinead

264
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,800
O'Connor and douche and the motorcycle

265
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
Ajax crashed a minute ago still works

266
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,530
and he was able to rep it without

267
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,930
Deadpool hearing it and it's taking the

268
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,370
cops forever to show up to the scene

269
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:06,380
isn't it no seriously it's weird when

270
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,000
Deadpool makes jokes like this it's sort

271
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,740
of undermines almost anyone's motivation

272
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,880
for doing what they do in this movie

273
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
when the main character is acknowledging

274
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,150
it's a movie it's also funny so you can

275
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,350
see the bind I'm it Deadpool

276
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,030
intentionally breaks all his hands and

277
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,680
feet in fruitless attacks on Colossus

278
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,450
then saws off his hand to escape my

279
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,100
question is what happens if he falls and

280
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,480
splats on the street instead of looking

281
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,770
out and falling into a moving garbage

282
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,360
truck doesn't Colossus easily collect

283
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,470
him and take him prisoner during the

284
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,970
entire time weed cuts the Rose own arm

285
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,590
Colossus just sits there and watches it

286
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,280
for some reason

287
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,960
movies torture sequences makes zero dark

288
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,940
thirty blush snacks a dry cleaning tag

289
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,460
off your lab coat or the was that tag so

290
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,110
Wade who is strapped to a hospital bed

291
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,510
could steal it so easily well pretty

292
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,760
much har-har reference to that other

293
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,110
terrible movie where Ryan Reynolds

294
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,610
played Deadpool until he stopped meant

295
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,380
movie and protests also why wouldn't

296
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,000
Ajax so his mouth shut at this point is

297
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,560
he worried about the fan backlash

298
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,939
for this scene the director just asked

299
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,319
Ryan Reynolds to recall how he felt

300
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,470
after seeing the first cut of RIPD so

301
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,120
the neck head restraints here didn't

302
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,439
prevent this head but what could he

303
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,970
possibly have done to hurt it yeah he's

304
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,529
stronger now but he's still restrained

305
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,120
and she's also a mega mutant with

306
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,740
unbelievable strength so shouldn't this

307
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,839
feel more like a love tap ah and now we

308
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,399
instantly learned this girl's always has

309
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,959
a match in her mouth is just an excuse

310
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,430
to let weight escape this rescue down

311
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,709
prison and if she does literally always

312
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,269
have a match in her mouth how and why

313
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,769
would she not notice its absence after a

314
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,999
move like this shouldn't she be

315
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,259
instantly saying where's my fucking

316
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,850
match did I drop it I know I had a match

317
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,350
in my mouth just now because I always do

318
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,279
and others like that

319
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,050
I'm ignition well it looks like somebody

320
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,970
saw irreversible and someone saw Eastern

321
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,529
Promises as well remember this is a

322
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,790
fight between a guy with super sharp

323
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,769
reflexes who can feel no pain and a guy

324
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,089
who could feel pain but heals no matter

325
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:36,649
what meaning if you think about it too

326
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,089
much this fight loses all meaning and

327
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,670
impact no way around this fact Wade

328
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,499
killed his buddy Cunningham Francis who

329
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,819
experimented on this dude to make him

330
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,319
magic leaves him for dead in a warehouse

331
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,209
fire because Francis is the worst kind

332
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,980
of stupid overconfident Lee Bond villain

333
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,749
stupid and after rising from the dead

334
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:52,370
and finding himself still alive and wait

335
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,749
does not immediately go to his lady

336
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,550
instead he stalks her briefly then goes

337
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,319
to his wisecracking bartender friend you

338
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,850
look like Freddy Krueger face the

339
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,189
topographical map of Utah and you sound

340
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:02,449
like the director just let you riff for

341
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:03,769
a few minutes and somehow pick the worst

342
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,509
riff of the bunch I put all my money on

343
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:09,860
you and now even though it's been said a

344
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,449
couple times in this movie this is the

345
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:13,519
true roll credits moment so so water and

346
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,949
lemon for blood we're in

347
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,660
she's blind though right she smelled the

348
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,939
blood regardless how the hell does she

349
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,709
know his clothes aren't already red does

350
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,879
blood not stain red shirts

351
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,680
Lee was this guy on the ice when

352
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
Deadpool shot or stabbed him at first

353
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,980
the blood trail starts in the middle of

354
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,629
the ice so did Deadpool bring this guy

355
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,100
onto the rink shoot him and then go get

356
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,720
the Zamboni or did he just find this guy

357
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,279
already on the ice of course since

358
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,720
nobody's talking in Deadpool's killing

359
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,309
everyone I have no clue how he's finding

360
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,480
new people in every scene especially

361
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,699
this guy looks on everything looks are

362
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,540
everything

363
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,069
Deadpool teaches millions of teenagers

364
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,170
the wrong listen to David Beckham speak

365
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,089
it's like a mouth sex two can of helium

366
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,279
how come every perceived human flaw in

367
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,990
this movie is the bastard child of two

368
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,519
incongruent things having sex with each

369
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,649
other I've seen this guy oh no you

370
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,029
haven't but that's kind of convenient

371
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,069
isn't it fine your midnight showing of

372
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:03,350
Blade two extremely self-aware movie

373
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,790
misses the opportunity to reference play

374
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,510
Trinity

375
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,620
which is the part of the series Ryan

376
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,730
Reynolds was in Stanley cameos finally

377
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,800
reached their inevitable meta apex as he

378
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,570
deejays a strip club the perfect

379
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,980
metaphor for these Marvel movies all

380
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,510
teased and then more teased and some

381
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,760
seizures and never-ending orgasms also

382
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,350
come on Stanley didn't even create

383
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,330
Deadpool but I always forget that Marvel

384
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,620
movies are contractually obligated a

385
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,080
fanboy whenever possible someone asking

386
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,590
for you

387
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,180
Ajax managed to find exactly where

388
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,500
Vanessa was working in the time it took

389
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,120
way to go straight here I guess it's

390
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,770
because angel visits the strip club so

391
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,120
often she knows the bartender space

392
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,740
immediately by looking at a picture hey

393
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,870
hey let's go damn dude you were in that

394
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,160
bathroom longer than the movie said you

395
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,660
were thankfully for this narrative she

396
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,340
dropped this super identifiable change

397
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,260
burst during her assault so we can know

398
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,410
for sure she's been abducted yeah

399
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,220
hilarious and it leads to a great

400
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,480
montage but it's all pointless

401
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,070
considering the script on the next page

402
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,600
calls for you to forget all these guns

403
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
before getting out of the taxi so

404
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,570
basically hilarious waste of everyone's

405
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,250
time the big house it's funny that I

406
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,600
only ever see two of you it's almost

407
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
like the studio couldn't afford another

408
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,420
x-man

409
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,650
strangely enough though they could

410
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,210
afford another Independence Day also

411
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,130
these two x-men were literally trying to

412
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,720
arrest and detain Deadpool the last time

413
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,250
we saw them now because someone

414
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,260
kidnapped his girl so he says there his

415
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,090
instant allies taxi driver picks up

416
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,680
Deadpool for a second fare despite the

417
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,940
fact that he got stiffed by him last

418
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,470
time let's not even get into the odds of

419
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,910
him getting the same cab driver twice in

420
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,500
a row also though these two x-men took

421
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,150
the fucking x-men plane to go capture

422
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,980
Deadpool earlier but here they just ride

423
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,390
in a taxi with Deadpool like chumps

424
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,520
where's your duffel bag yep for a second

425
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,630
time in this movie Deadpool has

426
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,340
forgotten his bag of guns only this time

427
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,600
he actually made you watch while he

428
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,370
gathered and assembled said guns so

429
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,290
Deadpool is great a dickhole hilariously

430
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,060
Francis deploys a first line of defense

431
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,070
against Deadpool based on bullets we

432
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,600
only ever saw this chick while weed was

433
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,100
strapped to a torture table now she's

434
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,750
going haywire on Colossus who broke

435
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,650
Deadpool's bones just by taking a punch

436
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,300
that tweet was super important her phone

437
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,370
however is worthless apparently for the

438
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,840
record they don't really ever explain

439
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,490
negasonic powers either this looks like

440
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,230
actual flames coming off negasonic here

441
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,030
but all this power does is inconvenience

442
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,800
angel for a couple of seconds seriously

443
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,270
she takes like five repeated kidney

444
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,830
shots from an all-metal dude and feels

445
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,540
nothing she's basically Superman in this

446
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,340
movie female Superman with a match in my

447
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,810
mouth fetish even though the directive

448
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,580
is simply to kill Deadpool apparently he

449
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,290
can wave a white flag and get a Jax's

450
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,970
henchman to stop firing for some reason

451
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,540
whoa

452
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,040
Colossus his weakness is that he's too

453
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,420
much of a gentleman even when the woman

454
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,070
he's fighting is pure evil I mean I

455
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,330
guess they needed to do something to

456
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,190
make this a fight no not really she's

457
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,540
been hanging with him the entire time so

458
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,490
why is it exposed breasts the method she

459
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,350
needs to get back into this honestly how

460
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,910
is an air sucking gut punch even

461
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,320
possible on a dude made of metal the

462
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,880
physics of this fight between these two

463
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,110
leaves a lot to be desired

464
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,490
negasonic Zayn was perfect enough to

465
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,840
knock all three of these assholes out of

466
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,430
commission without smashing Deadpool to

467
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,500
bits because Francis loves parallels as

468
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,850
much as Deadpool loves revenge

469
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,500
Deadpool's girlfriend is in the same air

470
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,030
sucking chamber Wade was tortured it

471
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,260
let's forget that Francis probably

472
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,730
needed an episode of shipping wars to

473
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,230
even get this tank out here but whatever

474
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,870
you go back what do pots now wait Oh in

475
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,730
the ever long did you hear that did

476
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,590
Colossus call to tell you or al did

477
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,120
pools roommate I'm left to wonder why

478
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,680
Deadpool takes several minutes of climax

479
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,150
to defeat a villain he utterly schooled

480
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,710
and pinned earlier in the film in about

481
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,690
30 seconds yes I asked this earlier but

482
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,890
I'm asking it again because it's

483
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,000
blatantly unaddressed by the film

484
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,700
answers fine feast

485
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,620
yeah but why you both know what kind of

486
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,000
powers you have so what does a fist

487
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,770
fight gonna do like most Canadians Ryan

488
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,360
Reynolds just can't help but have Bieber

489
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,980
mania this probably should kill Vanessa

490
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,570
knowing the strength this guy has

491
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,340
oh there's negasonic apparently just now

492
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,780
recovering from that blast that sent

493
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,490
Deadpool up top several minutes ago even

494
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,020

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,000
about it and she's okay and even

503
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,740

you to be more like a villain in a movie

564
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,830
but in the case of the movie Deadpool

565

568
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,770

snacks handy it's a guy like Deadpool

570
