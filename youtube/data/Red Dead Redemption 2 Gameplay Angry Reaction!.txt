is my kind of game okay and I will give

76
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,539
you the full and honest opinion yes I'm

77
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,430
hyped for it but I know when something's

78
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,610
bad or when something's overhyped but

79
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,530
boy man the detail in this game is

80
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,240
looking crazy I mean look at this shit

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,030
this is the conduct the kind of effort

82
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,460
now not every developer it's a little

83
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,020
unfair because not every developer can

84
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,039
do this yeah obviously we got and this

85
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,440
is multimillion-dollar budget we're

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,440
talking so anytime one of these things

87
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,479
come out boy it's an event and look at

88
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,270
this the detail the story when I'm most

89
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,460
concerned about is how can you ever top

90
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,889
the story of john marston like compared

91
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:34,880
you know I'm saying

92
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,550
so maybe the story might not be as good

93
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,099
as the first but as certainly as far as

94
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,740
gameplay mechanics graphics definitely

95
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,780
lighting all that stuff is better than

96
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,400
the first already yes from what we've

97
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,650
seen we've got many games it looks like

98
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,110
you can live a life in the Wild West and

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,900
I'm just gonna love this and you know I

100
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,639
want to even play the online mode which

101
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,469
comes out after right that's like a

102
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:00,349
month delay month but oh my god I don't

103

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:11,539
and make cards snake oil snake oil cards

106
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,750
