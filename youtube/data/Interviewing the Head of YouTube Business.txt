1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,300
just a quick preface here this interview

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,060
took place twelve days ago now so any

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,370
reference in this interview to Logan

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,099
Paul or Logan Paul controversy is in

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,230
reference to the events that transpired

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,309
around the first of the year the

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,650
Japanese forests not at all referencing

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,690
the more recent Logan Paul controversy

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,029
and and subsequent D monetization of his

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,070
channel none of that is reference

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,810
because that all happened after this

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,910
interview took place while I would love

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,740
to know more specifically what's around

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,599
YouTube with these recent events

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,340
unfortunately this interview took place

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,300
before they happened hope that's clear

17
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,210
okay here's the interview alright

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,520
welcome ah have you ever made a YouTube

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,219
video before no it's my first one I'm

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,260
always very vocal with what I see as

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,719
YouTube YouTube strengths and YouTube

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,809
shortcomings and as Chris around

23
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,250
Christmas and New Year's when all the

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,020
logan paul stuff was going down and

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,670
there was a lot of criticism of

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,329
youtube's PR and everything else i

27
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,240
e-mailed robert here and said why not

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
use the platform as a way to communicate

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,369
youtube's positions on these things in

30
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,549
its outlook for the future and he said

31
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,619
that's a great idea and this is sort of

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,820
a first stab at that

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,570
he offered thank you to come on my

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,939
youtube channel and talk about the

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,500
future of youtube and answer whatever

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,200

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,900

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,700
that's what do you guys do risky stuff

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,979
every day tell us who you are I think

43
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,509
most youtubers and they think of YouTube

44
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,299
leadership's they know Susan but people

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,979
don't know you so who are you and what

46
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,970

questions have to do with the Logan Paul

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,610
controversies it's still very very fresh

59
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,100
and to leave that off I'm curious what's

60
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,470
it like for you and then what's it like

61
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,170
inside of YouTube when something like

62
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,640
that or any of the previous

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,740
controversies happen is there a protocol

64
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,030
in place yeah I mean we have depending

65
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,180
on on severity of the issue at hand we

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,800
have escalation processes that take

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,920
place and and we're looking at you know

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,680
how this how this works against the

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,750
guidelines the community guidelines that

70
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,120
we have set on YouTube which really help

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,620
operate an open platform like ours

72
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,600
there's there's quite a lot of work that

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,910
goes on behind the scenes that the rest

74
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,280
of the world doesn't see how did it how

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,420
did it land on the home page I think you

76
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,380
have there are no simple answers to that

77
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,590
except that there was a lot of interest

78
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,000
in that video there were a lot of search

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,760
searches for it all around the world on

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,060
YouTube and it ended up there I think

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,640
was nine days between it happening and

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,670
you guys responding to it how about you

83
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,060
better so so we actually we had a we had

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,970
a press reply the next day within in

85
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,400
less than 24 hours but our social

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,370
response was delayed and so what we were

87
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,440
working on is we were trying to

88
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,070
formulate our our response and of course

89
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,660
you know with Logan and a lot of his

90
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,090
projects for original productions there

91
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,160
are hundreds of people involved people

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,690
whose paychecks depend on it so we don't

93
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,570
want to make a rash decision that

94
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,940
impacts so many people's livelihood it's

95
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,620
not just Logan many other people are

96
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,970
cross multiple projects however we do

97
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,620
want to be much faster we're looking at

98
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,200
those processes and and and we want to

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,010
be much more active there was a line in

100
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,060
that statement you guys put out an

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,620
unsocial that said we'll have more to

102
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,900
share soon on the steps we're taking to

103
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,810
ensure a video like this is never

104
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,939
circulated

105
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,569
and I think that line of video like this

106
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,340
had a lot of the community questioning

107
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,949
what that means and this is a bigger

108
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:34,500
question which is how do you how do you

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,180
balance kind of being the thought police

110
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,909
saying this is okay and this is not

111
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,259
versus free speech which is are like

112
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,210
YouTube is stood for so much so and and

113
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,860
you're you're hitting the nail on the

114
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,419
head which this is one of the hardest

115
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,430
things scaling open is developing

116
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,159
standards making sure that users feel

117
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,590
safe creators feel safe and advertisers

118
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,349
feel safe obviously this video was not

119
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,469
something that you know and I don't

120
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,659
think anyone you know anyone is proud of

121
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,969
proud to be associated with but we think

122
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,159
that the more we develop our Community

123
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,960
Guidelines the more we hone them and

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,580
there will our standards along those

125
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,090
lines we think we we can get their

126
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,120
culture YouTube culture I've noticed

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,009
sort of in the last year last year plus

128
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,469
drama has been drama would be the

129
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,419
descriptor out used to really drive the

130
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,189
culture of YouTube what do you think of

131
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:28,680
that I found that are you talking about

132
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,770
the drama you create drama is rewarded

133
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,810
with use drama is rewarded with

134
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,060
attention drama is rewarded ultimately

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,550
with dollars and I think a lot of that

136
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,300
is what what eventually sort of

137
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,960
metastasized into the kind of

138
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,419
sensationalist content that let things

139
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,460
like the Logan Paula controversy happen

140
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,779
yeah how do you how does YouTube affect

141
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,729
culture it to I'm talking about the

142
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,819
incentives and disincentives for that or

143
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,360
thinking very deeply and every single

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,729
day now on how do we create the right

145
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,860
incentives and disincentives for

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,939
creators to to do the right thing on

147
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,139
YouTube and that means a lot of

148
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,520
different things that means do the right

149
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,439
things for advertisers do the right

150
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,449
things for their users you know for the

151
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,469
platform organically and not chase

152
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,240
sensationalism not chase views for the

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,419
sake of views not use drama for the sake

154
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,520
of use and not use drama at our expense

155
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,770
for the sake of use it so what's at

156
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,810
heart for us is that we deeply care

157
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,780
about the Train

158
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,620
Riko system that's my job if you don't

159
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,990
succeed we don't succeed what we want to

160
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,900
make sure that creators who are making a

161
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,400
living on YouTube feel safe doing so you

162
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,110
know that there's no gaming basically

163
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,910
that it's just all about like doing the

164
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,510
right thing

165
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,240
and it is our job to set those

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,490
guidelines in place and the incentives

167
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,830
in place so so we're working that quite

168
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,500
busily what kind of creators would you

169
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,300
like to see more of on the platform are

170
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,450
you talking about me personally or - the

171
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,280
bigger question of culture like whoa

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,470
what would you love to see ultimately is

173
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,450
kind of the defining creator movement on

174
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,790
the platform and how would how would you

175
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,380
how would you to foster the kind of

176
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,370
relationships needed to enable I so I

177
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,460
personally like a lot of news content

178
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,490
news related content on YouTube it just

179
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,320
you know helps catch up on everything's

180
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,150
going on and it's just and it has a

181
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,430
different Flair on YouTube educational

182
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,139
content but I don't mean the traditional

183
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,910
educational says it's just that I I've

184
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,180
learned something new my older daughter

185
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,240
who became vegan and you know we didn't

186
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,190
want them to become vegan and and and

187
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,320
then you know them you know because it's

188
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,100
a lot of work Penda and you know she

189
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,020
found all the inspiration and all the

190
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,970
arguments and how to argue and convince

191
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,610
parents on YouTube by the way the one

192
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,910
category I didn't mention is and we

193
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,450
would like more and more female creators

194
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,880
on the platform right that yeah it's

195
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,780
it's a huge opportunity huge and and so

196
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,190
Elle Mills have you discovered Ella

197
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,840
Mills yet and by the way every time you

198
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,190
told me that I remember the last time

199
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,390
you said oh you know you gotta watch

200
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,760
this this kind david dobrik this was

201
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,130
like three years ago it was like he's on

202
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,580
the rise and of course yeah so I know

203
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,470
you'd have an eye for it so I'll make

204
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,300
sure to follow her no but that's that's

205
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,890
another category that we really focused

206
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,620
on what what do we want to grow in we

207
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,570
want everybody to grow but what do we

208
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,219
want to grow a little bit more that

209
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,860
maybe is underserved that maybe needs

210
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,350
the extra push extra push in terms our

211
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,970
attention extra push in terms of

212
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,350
marketing

213
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,270
count them funding whatever it is and

214
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,370
then we put somebody on it and say build

215
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,500
a plan they build a plan approve the

216
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,790
plan and then they start executing

217
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,260
against it that's really that's how the

218
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,830
process with us works this is a big kind

219
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,810
of this is a big question I have that

220
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,060
I've always had which is that in all my

221
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,700
years in television I never met a TV

222
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,460
studio head who wasn't at one time a TV

223
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,220
producer and in cinema I've never met a

224
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,840
movie studio and who didn't produce

225
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,140
movies but no one on the YouTube sort of

226
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,960
senior executive leadership side has

227
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,530
ever made a living as a creator so how

228
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,360
do you how does Susan how do the other

229
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,850
leaders at YouTube empathize with the

230
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,710
struggles of being a creator having

231
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,520
never been there yourself so I might not

232
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,740
have produced myself but I just give you

233
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
my little quick background I started in

234
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,170
the mailroom of a talent agency working

235
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,150
with writers actors directors States

236
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,220
tickling their pictures and resumes and

237
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,600
sending it to cast entities that Sarah

238
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,870
became an assistant and just went to

239
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,450
work for a production movie production

240
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,250
financing companies have made a lot of

241
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,880
films and and then went to HBO and

242
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,370
launched HBO's around the world and

243
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,290
eventually to Netflix and then to

244
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,720
YouTube so I've been around content all

245
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,530
of my professional career and and I've

246
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,080
learned it from inside out and every

247
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,970
angle so I'm deeply passionate about it

248
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,850
I love it and that's my both my

249
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,190
professional and personal life now when

250
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,620
it comes to when it comes to but I have

251
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,480
now been a YouTube creator myself when

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,800
you think about YouTube it's really a

253
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,080
massive platform it's a technology like

254
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,110
it's massive technological feat and what

255
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,030
you really need is people who are

256
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,400
incredibly proficient at building an

257
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,460
infrastructure on a you know

258
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,600
unprecedented level all around the world

259
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,880
of interesting 450 hours of video every

260
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,260
single minute is streaming in billion

261
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,910
hours a day in HD quality so what our

262
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,640
company has to do is sort of marry the

263
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,620
technological prowess with content

264
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,970
prowess together and and do it at scale

265
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,400
the changes in the partner program so

266
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,050
you have to have four thousand hours of

267
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,400
watch time a thousand subs to monetize a

268
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,020
question or something I saw a lot on on

269
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,280
Twitter was new or tiny YouTube channels

270
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,970
seeing that is tremendously discouraging

271
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,400
how do you how do you respond to that so

272
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,160
we don't succeed unless you succeed if

273
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,170
there are no great creators they're not

274
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,270
gonna be enough users there's not enough

275
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,990
advertisers it just it doesn't work so

276
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,280
we we think that this level is high

277
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,380
enough for us to learn about the partner

278
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,330
so that we can turn the ads on them and

279
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,270
not disappoint advertisers and at the

280
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,280
same time that it's not so far out that

281
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,260
it will be untenable and you know and

282
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,850
unreachable for that we want as many

283
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,880
creators monetizing but we also want to

284
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,550
make sure that everybody who's

285
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,770
monetizing is doing the right thing and

286
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,930
and it's protective because if somebody

287
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,190
doesn't do the right thing and are in

288
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,930
there and that vert eyes is react in a

289
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,190
certain way then all of you get punished

290
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,960
that's not a good outcome because then

291
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,010
you don't succeed we don't succeed

292
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,010
because nobody is happy um about

293
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,470
monetization when you guys made the

294
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,270
changes that were made in response to ad

295
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,940
pocalypse there's a lot of frustration a

296
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,250
lot of frustration expected expressed on

297
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,440
social media did you guys see that

298
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,650
outcry coming for the false positives

299
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,260
did it catch you off guard it was really

300
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,120
really hard because if you're just

301
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,280
trying to stabilize the ecosystem that's

302
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,330
you know that's that's moving around so

303
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,100
yes we heard the outcry of course and

304
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,900
and it's the I can tell you there's

305
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,120
nothing more painful than hear from the

306
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,940
advertisers their stories and nothing

307
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,680
more painful is than hear from the

308
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,620
creators and and you should know both

309
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,630
sides think that we favor the other you

310
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,890
know and so we clearly have work to do

311
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,210
it does feel like at times that what

312
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,370
creators want to make what audiences

313
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,130
want to see doesn't always align or

314
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,120
doesn't align

315
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,880
what advertisers want to want to buy

316
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,529
against how do you how do you rectify

317
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:07,680
that some sometimes that happens and and

318
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,330
it's really hard to tell an advertiser

319
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,339
look you must buy this and because they

320
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,560
sell it guess my brand and I just don't

321
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,130
want to you know that's their choice one

322
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,500
of the one of the things that we worked

323
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,870
really hard on last year was our yellow

324
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,000
monetization icon because then really

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,250
which I know might have been you know

326
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,320
painful and worked but it was something

327
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,870
that helped us reduce false positives by

328
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,970
30 percent it was really impactful you

329
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,520
know suddenly getting getting input from

330
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,320
creators saying look this was not

331
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,020
correct everyone who participated let me

332
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,990
ask you about the yellow icon because

333
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,790
from a creator from the most cynical

334
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,460
creator perspective what it what a few

335
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,529
does is a way of saying we think this

336
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,900
might not be advertiser friendly so

337
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,730
we're gonna cut your revenue on it but

338
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,920
we're still playing it so it's costing

339
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,810
you the it's costing you the Creator

340
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,810
money while we figure this out

341
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,060
and I think that I know I as a creator

342
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,100
found that very insulting I've known

343
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,140
that very upsetting why do I have to

344
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,510
take your algorithms mistake why does it

345
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,690
have to cost me money how does YouTube

346
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,790
address something like that at the kind

347
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,150
of scale that I remember you are calling

348
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,730
on this issue I think those may be

349
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,690
October and were there yeah and and

350
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,980
that's when we start to think about the

351
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,020
let's let's let's you know what stole

352
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,779
creators that they shouldn't you know

353
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,520
published them yet have them unlisted I

354
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,029
guess with you it's can't and and then

355
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,260
you know they won't go through the

356
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,620
volatility so that that has worked if

357
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,240
you as a creator it feels like there's a

358
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,910
lot of tension between the creator

359
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,730
community and YouTube as a company is

360
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,920
that is that felt do you think it's a

361
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,150
fair statement is that felt within

362
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,089
YouTube as a company I wouldn't want to

363
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,010
call it tension because it would it

364
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,959
would imply that we're on opposite sides

365
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,880
somehow and we're not I think we're on

366
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,160
the same side the thing that we have

367
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,980
struggled with and you've told that to

368
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,810
me multiple times is communication and

369
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,880
you should know that we try so hard to

370
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,230
communicate with creators

371
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,200
but it's only so disheartening but like

372
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,810
we want feedback to keep on coming but

373
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,030
it's disheartening to hear that it's not

374
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,620
cutting through but you should know that

375
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,390
we don't see this tension we see it as

376
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,620
if people are not happy we have a

377
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,090
problem we're on the same side we need

378
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,220
to figure out how to fix it well let me

379
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,280
let me end then with this this this and

380
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,600
this question this is more of a prompt

381
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,420
than a question but I think that

382
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,300
YouTube's never been good at saying

383
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,310
here's what matters to us here's what we

384
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,260
stand for and here's what to expect from

385
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,410
us so I invite you to now just kind of

386
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,330
use this platform as a way to tell all

387
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,490
of us creators in the community what

388
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,430
matters to you what do you stand for and

389
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,550
what is next for YouTube as as a

390
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,340
platform sure so so what we stand for is

391
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,650
is really four freedoms freedom of

392
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,780
opportunity anybody to make a living on

393
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,610
YouTube you know bring revenue from the

394
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,560
entire world and there are many

395
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,250
wonderful examples freedom of speech as

396
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,520
important as ever freedom of information

397
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,160
accessing it I grew up in in communist

398
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,660
country in Czechoslovakia behind the

399
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,210
Iron Curtain it's really important you

400
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,250
know the openness and freedom of speech

401
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,690
and freedom of information is really

402
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,940
important to me and that that is why I I

403
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,310
love what I do and then the fourth one

404
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,150
is freedom to belong people creating

405
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,920
communities on YouTube that they can

406
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,280
feel like they can share a bit more with

407
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,480
that they may not have in person

408
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,650
somewhere else but on the YouTube they

409
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,810
do so we have these four core freedoms

410
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,800
that we truly care about what what is

411
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
important to us is the success of our

412
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,620
partners the partners our creators and

413
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,490
advertisers so to us what's most

414
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,900
important is bringing these two

415
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,180
communities together advertisers and

416
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,590
creators and make sure that they all

417
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,990
succeed and if they do we'll be fine and

418
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,000
everything that I say is like that you

419
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,550
know we're on your side we mean it we

420
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,710
may not get it right you know many times

421
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,750
or for one reason or another

422
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,210
but the intent is always good the intent

423
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,330
is always on your side and so hopefully

424
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,589
we can deliver more and

425
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,000
and truly make everybody even happier

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,570
and more successful well Robert thank

427
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,909
you for coming on and I want to say that

428
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,760
Robert did not ask me to do this but I

429
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,620
can't have you on Robert without

430
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,760
plugging your book

431
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,640
stream Punk's by reading this book I got

432
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,370
to understand how you think of YouTube

433
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,289
and that means a lot considering you're

434
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,360
the one pulling all the strings and then

435
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,470
the second thing that I like the most

436
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,090
and I wish you had talked more about it

437
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,289
I think it's just the first chapter of

438
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,510
the preface or something is when you

439
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,909
talk about your upbringing in here

440
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:02,399
behind the Iron Curtain and not having

441
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,760
any access to media at all in the first

442
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,679
movie that you ever saw was terminator

443
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,559
but it was dubbed and checked nanika I

444
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,710
thought oh say Oh same here jonah had an

445
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,539
understanding that that's where you're

446
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,890
coming from and now that you're in the

447
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,659
position you were in enables me to

448
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,309
empathize with you and by proxy with

449
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,649
youtube and more so Thank You Casey

450
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:25,440
thanks for having me here to do this is

451
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,870
Jay all right thanks for watching if you

452
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,700
made it that far I just want to put this

453
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,710
at the end to again Thank You Tube thank

454
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,720
Robert for doing this and then also to

455
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,850
encourage YouTube to do more of this

456
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,169
there are a lot of other creators in

457
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:38,640
this platform that I know would love to

458
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,100
interview some of the senior management

459
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,559
at YouTube and there is certainly enough

460
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,850
controversy taking place in this

461
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,890
platform to warrant those interviews so

462
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,480
I know it may not make the most

463
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,580
interesting or fun video but I do think

464
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
this is an effective way for YouTube to

465
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,419
share what the hell is going on within

466
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,840
that company to us to the community so

467
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,270
thanks YouTube okay tomorrow I will be

468
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,000
back to my regular programming
