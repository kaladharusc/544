this this is the convention center here where I'm going to be doing my talk

81
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,870
it is so humid out right now that the lens is all blurry

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,900
this is just gonna have to be the soft focus episode there are a lot of

83
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,410
questions in the comments yesterday about what are these talks that i do how

84
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,980
do i do then why do i do then what do I talked about yesterday in brazil i was

85
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,730
talking about online marketing in and mainstream traditional media versus new

86
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,990
media today's event called and econ here in Colombia is much more of a business

87
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,600
industry event where they're talking about what they're talking about

88
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,330
information technologies and everything in between

89
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,760
they invite me to these things because my background in in television and then

90
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,130
feature films and then in journalism and then in technology and all of these

91
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,550
different trajectories of my career is taking me on has provided me with a

92
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,290
perspective that the kinds of people that attend these events want to hear

93
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,980
from honor of being invited to these like great events prior to travel to

94
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,250
like exotic countries and I come here and I connect with like a huge audience

95
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,820
and speak them about all kinds of stuff question that I saw like a thousand

96
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,310
times was do i get paid for these

97
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,440
well yes and no for academic lectures like last year I spoke at Yale and i was

98
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,190
invited to speak at Harvard this year and then I spoke at MIT to students in

99
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,630
their mba program those kinds of things like no I don't get I don't get paid for

100
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,870
those sorts of things but ones that are more for-profit ones that people

101
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,100
actually pay admission to sometimes I do get paid and that's amazing but all of

102
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,570
them almost without exception always pay for my travel and help me get there so

103
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,260
it really is like an awesome excuse to travel and then when i get to wherever

104
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm going it's a great way to engage with like people from the other side of

105
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,420
the planet who are doing something similar to what i do that's what today

106
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,660
is about to change anything

107
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:25,170
it's almost time i get my present alive yes is that many have nobody

108
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,170
