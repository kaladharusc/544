train from Connecticut to New York and

17
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:10,709
then a plane from New York to Tokyo

18
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,170
Tokyo to Vietnam it was like a trap

grand scheme of things that's nothing

also it's 12 hours we had to you that

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,510
doesn't really have much bearing am i

screwing up you see every year towards

26
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,180
the end of the summer right before we

27
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,160
had to go back to school I would take

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,370
Owen on a big father-son trip Vietnam

29
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,090

[Music]

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,970
this was our first trip 2002 in the

32
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,730
Bahamas it was something I took a lot of

33
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,319
pride in something that was important to

34
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,020
me because as a kid it's something I

35
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,660
always wanted and as a parent it was a

36
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,640
way of kind of alleviating the guilt I

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,640
had from working so much but mainly I

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
just love sharing new experiences with

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:41,040
my boy

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I thought it was one two three days but

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,610
it's actually one two three days okay

42
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,409
this is where you get a motorcycle

43
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,800
Vietnam

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,150
the idea behind this particular

45
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,720
adventure was to get a motorcycle state

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,849
going on the back and then drive through

47
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,890
the vietnam countryside a couple of

48
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,569
things i learned quickly a lot of

49
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,849
scooters in vietnam not a lot of

50
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,730
motorcycles i found the guy who said he

51
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,800
could get us a motorcycle then we got

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,750
there and it was a scooter so then we

53
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,340
waited while they put together a

54
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,130
motorcycle that they eventually gave to

55
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,160
us that's the bike that's our bike right

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
there that little blue thing so we start

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,389

58
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,050
Bobby so we come from here yep do my job

59
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,120

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,810
the bike there are no words that can

61
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,450
describe the lawlessness that is driving

62
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,800
in

I've ridden a motorcycle in New York

64
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,660
City for years but riding in Hanoi was

65
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,830

motorcycle journey it's much calmer now

69
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,280
it's cobber

70
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,680
it's not top eventually we escaped the

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,650
city and landed someone that looked a

72
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,320
lot more like what I had imagined

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:57,190
Vietnam look this is snake one it snakes

74
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,250
in there if some these snakes and snakes

75
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,760
and bees and honey

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,490
I guess they just let it ferment and

77
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,920
that snake one

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,360
this is just all bumblebees here what

79
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,600
does it taste like

your teeth give me a smile those teeth

85
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,849
let me see that I know I made it seem

86
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,340
like this was an adventure me a story

87
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,870
about riding a motorcycle through the

88
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,810
jungles of Vietnam but it's not this

89
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,029
this is a nostalgia movie this is a

90
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,590
movie about what my relationship was

91
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,909
like with my kid four years ago see when

92
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,219
I think of my time with my dad

93
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,550
I only remember moments moments of he

94
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,770
and I in the car together moments around

95
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,560
holidays but I was one of four kids he

96
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,650
had a full-time job we never had solid

97
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,930
blocks of time together and when I look

98
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,050
back at my relationship with Owen all I

99
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,110
remember are these huge chunks of time

100
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,349
that we set aside just to be with each

101
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:07,669
other

102
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,159
we're rearranging all the furniture in

103
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,830
our sleeping quarters to optimize

104
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,059
exposure to the fans it has its 99

105
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:21,259
degrees up here with 99 percent humidity

don't know that I'd call it super safe

113
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:32,569
seems fine no one has a little fan club

114
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:41,629
over here the motorcycle trip was like

115
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,509
four days it was fun it was hard it was

116
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:53,059
fun the first day and a half

117
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,100
Owen didn't have a seat he's sitting on

118
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,959
the aluminum cage on the back of the

119
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,779
bike as passenger on the motorcycle

120
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:03,889
Owen seat which is this metal right here

121
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,589
is not terribly comfortable so we're

122
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,019
going to appropriate this pad for

123
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:19,730
additional personally I use an old inner

124
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,389
tube to attach the cushion I think it's

125
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,290
pretty good

126
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:41,790
comfy we weren't going anywhere there

127
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,400
was no mission no real finish line no

128
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,080
destination it was entirely a journey of

129
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,320
experience and along the way there were

130
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,000
things that really stuck out and it was

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,370
the weirdest things like I don't think

132
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,200
either of us will ever forget the

133
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,630
hot-water heater in this house we stayed

134
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,990
in okay this is where we're staying

down below with two women and a baby

town I can you couldn't see him either

146
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,470
you could have to trust your father we

147
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,720
eventually made it back to Hanoi the

148
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,240
motorcycle adventure was over we did run

149
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,560
out of gas on our way back we ran out of

150
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,190
fuel but the trip wasn't over we spent

151
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,860
the night exploring the city and then

152
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,990
the next thing we thought 35 percent

153
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,720
alcohol by volume so that's about as

154
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,080
strong as vodka and it comes in a one

155
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,640
gallon plastic jug it cost three dollars

156
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,290
we didn't buy the booze but we did

157
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,510
decide to spend our last couple days in

158
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,839
Vietnam going on a boat trip carabao yet

159
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,910
let's hope that now for whatever reason

160
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,290
I don't have a lot of footage from this

161

boat trip as you know that there was a

162
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,800
mother American tourists on the boat

163
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,100
with us and and well doing karaoke I got

164
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,009
terrifically drunk off very inexpensive

165
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:28,920

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,460
next day on the boat didn't do much of

170
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,070
anything

171
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,000

172
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,590
that was kind of where our Vietnam

173
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,050
adventure ended no my intention for this

174
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,630
was to make a travel video instead

175
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,540
though I found myself editing four year

176
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,630
old footage and experiencing this time

177
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:11,950
with my kid all over again

178
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,140
do you remember our trip to Vietnam

179
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,720
uh-huh what do you remember that trip

180
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
what do you think of when you think of

181
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,520
that trap the cruise the biking team

182
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,350
this trips like that now that you're now

183
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:40,430
that you're old now there is nothing in

184
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,400
life that highlights just how fast time

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,040
passes like watching your kids grow up

186
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,880
and to see this knowing what the next

187
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,420
four years of parenting was I guess to

188
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,510
look back if there was one thing I would

189
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,640
have done differently it would have been

190
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,170
to go on more of these adventures with

191
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,470
my boy but that's the thing you can't

192
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,760
change the past

193
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,410
I am glad though that I can look back on

194
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,420
this time I can look through these video

195
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:19,000
clips and read this notebook

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
