1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,220
what we do here this go back back back

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:53,020
[Music]

3
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,610
today we're gonna talk some shit about

4
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,920
tech destruction channels I'm sure you

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,050
guys have seen them they will tie some

6
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,540
fireworks to an iPhone and blow it up a

7
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,759
little shove Oh iPhone in a donkey's ass

8
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,090
to see if it survives there's dozens of

9
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,190
these channels and really they survive

10
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,830
on shock value Oh what happens if you

11
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,530
put an iPhone in in coke and freeze it

12
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,080
who knows maybe it'll get fucking cold

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,220
that's a big waste of money

14
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,570
there are a lot of YouTube videos that

15
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,970
get a shit ton of views because they go

16
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,160
the route of excess they'll use a shit

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,289
ton of Orbeez in a pool

18
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,210
they'll fill a pool with coke in the

19
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,289
case of techrax

20
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:34,190
or slime or dry ice or whatever the

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,050
reason I bring this up is because it

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,700
speaks to the mindset that a lot of

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,160
these channels have they know that if

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,020
you empty fifteen hundred gallons of

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,750
pig's blood into a pool that's enough to

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,700
get views you actually don't even have

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,289
to do anymore you don't actually have to

28
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,780
even go in the pool and dance around in

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,149
it or play Marco Polo or do anything

30
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,979
remotely intertemporal can you do me a

31
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,280
favor and dip your head in there alright

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,020
put water guns in the pool spray each

33
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,280
other in the mouth with some fucking

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,660
coke using the water guns man

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,670
whip your dick out and ejaculate into it

36
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,580
for fuck's sake

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm here to help you give me 1,500

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,010
gallons of Coke or Pepsi I don't I'm not

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,210
exactly sure what they ended up using

40
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,310
and a giant pool I will make a video

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,990
1,500 times better than the video that

42
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,850
you made okay maybe it won't be 1,500

43
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,250
times is better but I'll grab a fucking

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,680
water weenie and suck the coke up with a

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,720
water weenie and that'll make you go

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,860
whoa like you are not very creative

47
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,890
don't let anyone tell you you can make

48
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,750
money on YouTube if you're not creative

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,700
you can be the most uncreated

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,560
motherfucker on the planet and you can

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,600
still get a lot of revenue because you

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,540
are willing to cover your walls and

53
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,270
condoms how much brain power does it

54
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,709
take to come up with one of these videos

55
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,720
does it take a lot of brainpower to

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,060
think of the idea have a cannibal step

57
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,340
on an iPhone one of my favorite techrax

58
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,860
videos is one where he destroys an

59
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,170
iPhone with a magnet the thought process

60
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,450
goes I want to destroy another iPhone I

61
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,340
already bought the iPhone I'll buy a

62
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,740
magnet video complete oh but what

63
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,050
happens if it doesn't go to plan well if

64
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,030
it doesn't go to plan just beat it to

65
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,440
shit what is up guys

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,959
Texters so I got a fully working iPhone

67
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,959
6s right here and I want to slap that

68
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,420
iPhone into the magnet phone is still

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,970
working that's a good sign anyways slap

70
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,500
it back on and look at this guy's the

71
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,630
phone won't turn on I know that it's

72
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,580
very subjective and a lot of your like

73
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,200
that was actually really fucking

74
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,980
entertaining

75
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,700
how fucking moronic he is I see that I'm

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,950
totally with you on that point if he was

77
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,620
intentionally retarded then I'd be like

78
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,140
oh hell yeah this channel is the fucking

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,880
best and I'm not just saying that

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,620
because they have videos like drilling a

81
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,390
hole in the bottom of an iPhone to make

82
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,610
a new headphone jack that's obviously a

83
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,920
joke unfortunately I don't think this

84
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,810
guy's actually the brightest screen in

85
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,580
the bunch did I ever tell you what the

86
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,590
definition of insanity is right now

87
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,209
we're gonna have tech wraps introduce

88
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,370
you to some of his iphones this is

89
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,170
insane that one is insane this is

90
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,120
incredible this is insane that's insane

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,140
crazy

92
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,160
it's insane this is insane this that is

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,690
incredible that's incredible this is

94
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,640
incredible it's insane that is

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,440
incredible this is great

96
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,150
obviously these tech channels don't drop

97
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,560
people in because of their awesome

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,569
personality they're usually pretty dull

99
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,479
but they will sometimes supplement the

100
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,250
tech destruction with a little bit of

101
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,229
commentary and oftentimes this

102
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,849
commentary just makes you say stop so if

103
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,770
you go like this guys it feels like this

104
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,800
function is on ice skates this birth or

105
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,870
this is what you guys are eating is

106
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,659
boiling down quick this is the most

107
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,639
relieving thing ever it just feels like

108
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,199
I don't know guys you're massaging

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,080
something good is blacker than anything

110
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,449
I've seen in my life occasionally you'll

111
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,819
have an epic moment where the dude doing

112
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,500
the commentating sounds like a real

113
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,870
fucking genius and use words like

114
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,979
initial impact there's the initial

115
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,050
crater guys to show you guys the initial

116
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,569
impact here the top layer is everywhere

117
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,550
might be messing up in the internals of

118
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,199
the iPhone just a little bit of a closer

119
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
analysis that what happened this is the

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
initial impact from the impact zone that

121
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
is insane I was actually just gonna make

122
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,479
fun of him from using the term initial

123
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,099
impact when there was only one impact

124
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,830
but I don't think I can really ignore

125
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,500
everything else you have a woman in red

126
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,210
dress in a field looks like an indie

127
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,240
film then she just very lazily flops on

128
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,250
to a cake and that's it that's the whole

129
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,139
fucking video they cut in half seating

130
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,669
through the middle that looks like these

131
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,380
guys do realize there's more tech out

132
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,449
there than just iPhones I mean I know

133
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,370
there is an appeal to destroying

134
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,919
something as pristine as an $800

135
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,440
brand-new iPhone if you want you can buy

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,449
a MacBook and just break it over your

137
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,940
knee get a fucking DSLR and just put a

138
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,069
railroad spike right through the lens to

139
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,319
prove to all the tech channels that you

140
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,789
can destroy more than just an iPhone

141
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:10,909
I've decided to make a video where I

142
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,550
destroy some alternative pieces of

143
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,190
Technology what is up guys Tech Rex here

144

these 15 Amazon - buttons is we're gonna

155
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,010
grab them and slam them into a blender

156
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,380
and we're gonna blend them up and see if

157
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,810
any of them activate how crazy would

bought these sheets so freakin

184
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,069
unsatisfying one of the reasons people

185
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:01,659
watch these videos is because they're

186
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,340
satisfying you know if you can get it

187
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,620
out of your head that that iPhone that's

188
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,569
about to be hit by a hammer it could

189
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:08,919
have been mine if you can get that out

190
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:09,669
of your head

191
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,860
then it is satisfying to see something

192
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,810
break to see something shatter however

193
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,520
there are a lot of these tech

194
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,560

195
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360

215
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,260
drop tests baby drop tests have been a

216
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,390
staple on YouTube for a long time now

217
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,550
it started off very simple no one wanted

218
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,500
to actually destroy phones but the first

219
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,180
people who did it really pioneered the

220
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,040
industry they drop the phone from one

221
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,260
foot up three feet up and five feet up

222
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,450
to see if it breaks we're doing it for

223
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,550
science at this point we're not really

224
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,680
doing it for science we're just doing it

225
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,620
for a very beautiful thumbnail really

226
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,870
