1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,550
okay welcome back this weekend is my

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,290
birthday and since last week you guys

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,770
let me have some quality meantime this

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,480
week I wanted to do something that you

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,429
all have been requesting for months I

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,170
see your comments you've been typing

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,580
them everywhere that you would like me

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,400
to follow along with a Bob Ross painting

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,320
tutorial now it's just gonna be a

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,090
painting you already know what's gonna

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,689
happen

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,220
but I want to do this in the most

13
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,710
respectful way possible because Bob Ross

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,140
was a wonderful man he actually means so

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,210
much to so many people so I don't just

16
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,730
want to make an abomination I'm actually

17
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,590
gonna try and make this a beautiful

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,660
painting and I hope that that's what you

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,129
want to see because that's literally

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,270
what you asked for

21
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,520
so I went to the youtubes and I picked a

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,620
beautiful Bob Ross painting that I would

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,450
love to have in my house I got

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,190
everything that I think that I need and

25
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,379
I'm also gonna do a coat of liquid white

26
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,809
which for my understanding no one really

27
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,699
knows what that is but it's a mixture of

28
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,920
titanium white paint and some sort of

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,960
oil I laid my colors out on the palette

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,969
I've just knows the colors off the top

31
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,829
of his head I've left them out in order

32
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,660
so I can remember which ones are which

33
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,970
now I am NOT a painter by any means I

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,010
think most of you know that is that too

35
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,750
white let's put some more oil in it I

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,090
didn't really watch Bob Ross I'd say

37
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,490
until I was an adult I watched a lot of

38
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,750
like Mister Rogers

39
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,420
after that it was like TV off go outside

40
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,520
to play on a swing set and shut up I'm

41
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,040
kidding but as an adult I've watched a

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
fair amount of him and you can tell from

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,049
just like watching one video of his why

44
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,810
he's such a loved person he's a calming

45
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,659
warming positive presence in a world

46
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,270
full of chaos and everyone remembers the

47
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,130
person that makes them feel like that

48
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,619
for so many people is the Bob Brooks I

49
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,780
promise you if any jokes are made in

50
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,759
this video they're all purely at my

51
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,799
ability or lack thereof and none would

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,170
ever ever be directed towards Bob does

53
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,420
this look right there's there's a marble

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,950
hair like right in the middle dear

55
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,229
artists that have pets how do you deal

56
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,030
with this basically just makes

57
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,130
everything slippy and wet so that you

58
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,290
can blend all of the colors on top of it

59
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,570
it's like an eyeshadow primer I went

60
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,070
ahead and more a shirt that was already

61
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,930
pre stained with toothpaste so I'm not

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,910
gonna be upset if it gets paint on it

63
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,160
the one that I chose is called sunset of

64
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,410
glow there we go welcome

65
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,910
back certainly glad you could join us

66
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,950
today I thought today we'd do a painting

67
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,380
it tomorrow my current one that'll make

68
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,570
you feel good inside so let's start

69
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,070
having hem around all the colors across

70
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,650
the screen that unites the song they're

71
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,960
doing that thoroughly don't appear let's

72
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,700
do it let's start with our little tiny

73
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,880
two inch brush today we're ready to a

74
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,310
small amount of the Indian yellow oh

75
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,070
wait this is in yellow I have a fair

76
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,590
amount of art fear can't make decisions

77
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,180
that require like finality this is super

78
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,370
light you got to be gentle with just a

79
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,350
little amounts of paint it's not an

80
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,480
Aries painting I feel like you can see

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,580
my brush strokes and you can't see his

82
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,740
you can tell that my easel is very

83
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,690
sturdy because it bounces every time

84
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,580
that I do something now without cleaning

85
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,130
the brush I'll go right into a little

86
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,870
bit of yellow ochre the same brush

87
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,240
without washing it which I love because

88
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,730
that's how I do my makeup this guy just

89
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:15,020
a little bit of art fear oh there's one

90
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,270
of the brush hairs in there his just

91
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,400
looks so nice and smooth and mine just

92
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,870
looks like like a actually airy sunset

93
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,209
yeah I bought these in a pack for like

94
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,880
$5 so some of his strokes are like a lot

95
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,800
broader this way so I'm gonna try that

96
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,450
so many factors that I feel like I've

97
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,490
goofed up on be careful with a bright

98
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,800
red it's a gorgeous gorgeous color I'm

99
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,750
gonna be careful is also strong one tuba

100
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,110
turned a whole Atlantic Ocean red

101
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,540
there's brush strokes ah it's a good

102
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,250
thing that pops really positive all the

103
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,900
time because he always tells you that

104
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,270
you can do it so I know although my

105
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,550
sunset has racing stripes I know it's

106
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,200
gonna be okay

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,900
there's a soul blended I wouldn't mind

108
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,450
to be blended like that look at my brush

109
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,910
why is my brush so angry at its light

110
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,970
though his red extends like across the

111
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,860
length of this so we gotta get some more

112
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,160
red which is making me nervous because

113
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,079
I'm just nervous in general so what I've

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,910
learned so far is that you really just

115
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,410
gotta go for it you can't do these

116
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,690
nervous Harry strokes you got to watch

117
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,790
Bob and just really go for it I'm gonna

118
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,889
make it more red now that my confidence

119
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,940
is building oh god what have I done Bob

120
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,770
I blend it too far what do I do

121
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,300
leave it alone leave it alone leave it

122
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,889
alone leave it alone it's getting a

123
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,240
little worried there than my too much

124
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
gene was gonna kick in and we were just

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,979
gonna have a red Armageddon sky but Bob

126
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,440
reminded me to stay confident and myself

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,330
let's see what he does let us use a

128
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,490
lavender color we'll just brush mix it

129
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,530
here I'll use a little phthalo blue okay

130
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,190
alizarin crimson proportionately how did

131
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,930
he mix that without ruining this whole

132
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,910
thing wait hold on Bob can you imagine

133
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,100
doing this live like on TV and you

134
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,870
didn't have you to Pez came out like

135
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,940
lavender about Minds just sort of like

136
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,850
oh I'm getting sweaty from the yard fear

137
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,600
just wherever wherever he said oh I've

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,430
definitely done the liquid white wrong

139
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,400
it's dripping into my son's so he says

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,860
just do it wherever blue just hit it

141
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,900
here gorgeous colors just to beat the

142
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,090
devil out of my brush I'm going to take

143
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,580
it over to my garbage because I'm not in

144
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,890
an art studio I'm in my home so I will

145
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,810
beat the devil in an appropriate place

146
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,950
and not ruin my floors

147
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,900
there's purple everywhere the devil is

148
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,240
everywhere I've resorted to just wiping

149
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,340
the devil which I think still helpful

150
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,370
power of Christ compels you did that

151
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,480

okay so we're gonna blend this so it

153
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,780
doesn't matter if there's still a little

154
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,490
purple in there the devil still in here

155
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,960

157

204
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,969
Mountain little minds like a loud

205
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,219
Mountain there's a Prussian blue of

206
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,159
Israel a crimson the mountains too loud

207
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,209

211
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,610
already got his knife out let's have

212
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,680
some fun you know me I'm ready to have

213
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,129
fun I like trees I also like trees how

214
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,860
was he doing that to us

215
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,120
Bob I'm still on the first three wait he

216
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,399
just made land out of nothing

217
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,620
he's like a volcano who needs to be

218
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,470
adorably dark green dark green dark

219
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,360
green but and occation here and there

220
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,759
and there and here I'm still mixing

221
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,100
colors how did he do that so far yes he

222
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,230
did this end parts faster than anything

223
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,149
I've ever done in my life then he took

224
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,769
his knife which is somehow magically

225
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,029
cleaned again I made a little path I've

226
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,339
certainly enjoyed our time together and

227
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,829
I hope you tried this one from all of us

228
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,709
here I'd like to wish you happy and God

229
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,100
bless my friend still trying to figure

230
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,160
out how what he did well I think that's

231
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,459
it Bob Ross has absolutely no paint on

232
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,620
his shirt not on his jeans than on his

233
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,620
hands and I have managed to ruin almost

234
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,170
everything in this entire room you know

235
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,990
what I did I put the water line under

236
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,149
what he called the reflection so it's

237
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,850
reflecting a reflection up into the

238
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,309
mountain why don't I fix that that makes

239
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,100
more sense right my painting had a fatal

240
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,610
flaw in it I'm gonna show mine versus

241
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,970
his it's not really about your abilities

242
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,429
just about the freedom and the joy of

243
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,089
painting

244
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,550
right Bob Ross holds such a nostalgic

245
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,439
and wonderful place in so many people's

246
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,930
hearts that it is fun to see someone

247
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,269
just recreate one of his paintings so I

248
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,399
think my too much gene really took over

249
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,279
in a lot of places and I did put an

250
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,029
awful awful lot amount of liquid white

251
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,029
on the canvas before we begin but other

252
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,069
than that if he makes it really nice and

253
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,620
fun and relaxing and I also like I

254
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,480
wanted to do something nice this weekend

255
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,370

259
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,399
thinking the kitchen ceiling too

260
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,379

261
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,879
