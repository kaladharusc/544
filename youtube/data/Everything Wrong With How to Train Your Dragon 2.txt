1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,740
one whole minute of logos two of which

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,559
were for the same company this a spark

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,210
B How to Train Your Dragon franchise is

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,680
based on British children's books and

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,570
Berk is a semi dirty word to British

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,340
children Berk means nothing to America

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,900
kids for the US version they should have

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,850
changed the village name to fart this is

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,580
Park also narration and the same

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,930
narration that started and ended the

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,390
first movie dragon racing these Berk

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,040
assholes are the most progressive in

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,899
human history going from hating dragons

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,700
for Bulls reasons to having dragon races

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,110
in just five years after learning they

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,040
weren't so bad after all

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,200
also discount Quidditch that's nine for

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,879
the turns of course the twins are

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:42,989
winning they're two people when they

20
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,129
have the dragon with the two heads

21
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,390
giving them an unfair advantage

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,520
now dragons used to be a bit of a

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,430
problem here but that was five years ago

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,379
everyone was terrified of dragons and

25
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,550
they constantly burned down the village

26
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,710
yes that was a bit of a problem but they

27
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,360
domesticated dragons in only five years

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,460
come on the Dragons fly into the stable

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,199
for an expositional tour even though the

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,589
race isn't over we have custom stables

31
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:06,510
all-you-can-eat feeding stations a full

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,460
service dragon wash shirt could not

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,630
possibly have the infrastructure to

34
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,070
support this nonsense but I'm guessing

35
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,619
they sold high on all this dragon tears

36
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,869
even top-of-the-line fire prevention if

37
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,250
I do say so myself

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,420
as long as the dragon starts a fire

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,100
right under this exact spot otherwise

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,509
they're screwed also this isn't

41
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,009
preventing any fires it's just putting

42
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,270
them out they found a way to fireproof

43
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,409
their buildings with some sort of

44
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,060
magical paint then I'd be impressed this

45
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,680
town exchanged their dragon cruelty for

46
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,240
sheep cruelty too bad they don't have a

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,500
toothless to show them the error of

48
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,200
their ways adult sheep can weigh well

49
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
over a hundred pounds yet these kids are

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,350
able to throw it around hold it with one

51
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,970
arm and do backflips and without

52
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,570
breaking a sweat

53
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,649
excuse me this guy is not only wielding

54
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,729
a weapon that would be nearly impossible

55
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,320
to carry but he hits his friend in the

56
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,820
face with it and he isn't dead the next

57
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,140
time we see him he is completely fine

58
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,119
people who drive like this this movie

59
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,259
out does the look of the first movie

60
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,700
which was already amazing so amazing

61
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,950
I'll take off a few sins for what in the

62
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,780
name of wily coyote is this it

63
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,219
seems a little reckless for toothless to

64
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,360
be spitting fireballs at hiccup

65
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,799
especially after he seemed reluctant to

66
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,119
do this in the first place they both

67
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,770
survived this luckily for them there was

68
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,420
a much softer rock pillar directly

69
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,690
behind the one he almost slammed into

70
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,940
no that doesn't want you what dragon

71
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,710
slaughter that doesn't wash out isn't

72
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,120
that essentially water and you're in a

73
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,170
society with all you can eat dragon

74
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,600
buffets astrid manages to find hiccup in

75
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,830
this uncharted area hiccup and toothless

76
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,110
crashed into 76 seconds of flirting

77
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,840
youths I know that I'm not my father and

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,220
I never met my mother so does that make

79
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,140
me hiccup tossing in this bit about

80
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,550
never knowing his mother has less to do

81
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,140
with him knowing who he is and more to

82
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,430
do with letting the viewers who didn't

83
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,600
see the first movie now because it's

84
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,130
important to the story later the Emerald

85
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,170
City nor did the Wizard of Oz merge with

86
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,210
the fortress of solitude what happened

87
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,380
here I know what happened

88
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,910
Elsa got banished again Viking

89
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,830
lightsaber how do you suppose we explain

90
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,500
this master drago bludvist Drago

91
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,300
what fist pretty rich of a dude named

92
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,040
hiccup from Berk to make fun of anyone's

93
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,960
name also both Drago's parents and

94
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,220
ancestors are assholes

95
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,830
he's expecting a new shipment of dragons

96
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,200
for his army by tomorrow instead of just

97
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
killing the kids and taking their

98
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,020
dragons the dragon hunters explain their

99
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,430
entire mission to them these dragon

100
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,080
hunters are inexplicably unarmed so

101
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
hiccup and Astrid are able to free the

102
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
dragon and fly off with no trouble at

103
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,940
all we'll follow those trappers to Drago

104
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,040
and talk some sense into him why is it

105
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,540
that the heroes of these movies always

106
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,310
think that the guy described as a madman

107
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,750
sounds like someone you can talk sense

108
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,390
into so either hiccup didn't take the

109
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,739
five minutes to land and explain his

110
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,420
plan to Astrid or he's making it up as

111
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,870
he goes along

112
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,140
just what every dragon trapper needs one

113
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,820
end coats the blade and monstrous

114
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,130
nightmare saliva the other sprays

115
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,920
hideous zippleback gasp all it takes is

116
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,470
a spark can pick up surrenders his

117
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,640
weapon for the sole purpose of

118
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,260
explaining how it works also this

119
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,010
doesn't kill them

120
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,500
snotlout what are you doing now these

121
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,820
people keep finding hiccup if he doesn't

122
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,019
tell anyone where he's going and from

123
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,430
what I've seen this is uncharted

124
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,930
territory Mikey this girl is actually so

125
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,340
enamored with Kit Harington she's

126
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,570
willing to be captured by it with the

127
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,130
likelihood of scoring very look hiccups

128
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,510
mother is wearing her grand wizard of

129
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,100
dragons mask because when she goes

130
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,209
flying around she needs to look

131
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,010
potentially evil hiccups mom is able to

132
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,330
stand on this dragon without losing her

133
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,680
balance or getting knocked off because

134
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
movie forgot how wind works toothless

135
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,650
doesn't round twice in the series

136
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,260
gasp she recognizes hiccup small

137
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,150
basically unnoticeable scar that no one

138
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,620
has ever mentioned before also a mom

139
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,120
knows who our kid is after last seeing

140
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,590
him as a baby and because of a scar that

141
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,299
she forgot about long ago because she

142
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,560
was whisked away five seconds after he

143
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,919
got it a mother never forgets so I guess

144
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,090
we figured out what happened to Merida

145
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,830
after the end of brave no need for brave

146
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,750
to Pixar we're warning you Stella can

147
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,919
Dawber conveniently happened along the

148
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,150
hole in the ice where toothless fell

149
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,590
where hiccups helmet is conveniently

150
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,690
floating find them skunk Russia dragons

151
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,740
can apparently pick up sense like

152
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,210
bloodhounds even though this mask has

153
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,470
been sitting in ice cold water all this

154
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,180
time why not you try looking up a

155
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,889
Wikipedia page on dragons and finding

156
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,389
that ability also how have we not

157
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,680
already done this with another one of

158
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,240
hiccups belongings there is remarkably

159

really believe me I tried as well balki

168
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,639
doesn't believe hiccup even though he

169
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,229
still lives in Berk and she hasn't been

170
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,330
there in 20 years people are not capable

171
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,610
of change hiccup said the stay-at-home

172
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,289
mom of a small child and wife of the

173
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,970
village King before she decided to make

174
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,500
a go of this whole dragon sanctuary

175
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,669
thing baby who grows up to be the

176
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:19,229
protagonist isn't scared bliss by

177
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,300
something scary is cliche it broke my

178
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,510
heart to stay away but I believed he'd

179
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,510
be safer if I did safer how are you

180
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,889
saying that the Dragons would use your

181
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,240
children to get to you are you

182
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,610
spider-man we have to find them which in

183
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,349
this movie is as easy as just picking a

184
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:35,639
direction and stumbling on the person

185
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,139
you're looking for if we don't turn up

186
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,280
with dragons careful what you wish

187
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,660
hazard was able to hear Eretz say this

188
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,979
even though he was facing away from her

189
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,130
and she was flying a dragon every dragon

190
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,410
has its secrets and balcony's happens to

191
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,849
know what they all are and how to reveal

192
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,710
them all so how does toothless not know

193
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,389
his body can do this that would be like

194
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:58,710
me discovering that I had a third hand

195
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,090
my whole life and I didn't notice it

196
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,199
until some lady rub my neck

197
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,090
also you mean after five years of riding

198
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,440
toothless hiccup never learned this easy

199
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,599
ass trick even by accident I know we're

200
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,760
missing and they have tracking dragons

201
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,320
Astrid tells drago that everyone from

202
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,820
Berk is a dragon rider along with

203
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,080
specific information about the main

204
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,580
characters giving him an opportunity to

205
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,200
attack them before they can attack Drago

206
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,090
making Astrid some sort of Bond villains

207
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,919
/ hero movie subjects meet a more

208
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,569
animated arm muscle erotica

209
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,520
I think we did well with this one boss I

210
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,710
think you did well Stuart will you be my

211
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,559
wife once again marriage extortion so he

212
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,849
expects me to believe these kids were

213
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,020
able to get past all the guards and

214
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,399
soldiers hide in the traps with their

215
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,869
dragons and blow their way out of the

216
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,039
traps that were designed to contain

217
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,259
dragons and ultimately almost defeat

218
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,969
this giant army I guess so I guess

219
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,080
eventually she's gonna marry both of

220
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,909
these guys that's there's some adult

221
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,749
themes I'll tell you what yaha now he

222
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:49,770
had a fight

223
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,119
Drago is standing alone talking to

224
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,979
himself for most of this battle then

225
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,559
it's a good thing I brought a challenger

226
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,909
you can totally kill Drago right now by

227
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,529
the way this movie suddenly got Godzilla

228
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,059
Pacific Rim and Clash of the Titans on

229
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,589
our asses the ocean must get real deep

230
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,059
about ten feet into this Beach because

231
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,589
if it had a normal island Shore there

232
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:08,639
would be no way this creature

233
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,959
would be able to stay completely some

234
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,119
Berk also I know this is a fantasy world

235
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,830
but ships still cost time and money to

236
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,330
make right why would you waste some

237
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,979
perfectly good ships by not moving them

238
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,599
out of the way for the Alpha dragon to

239
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,159
make his grand entrance it takes more

240
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:22,259
than a lot to fire up the jomi this is

241
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,879
true of most Berk citizens the dragon

242
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,259
attacks in the first movie yielded no

243
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,759
fatalities but I'm pretty sure no one in

244
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,019
this movie will be killed by fire either

245
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,519
instead of designing a different

246
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,199
Godzilla dragon let's just make -

247
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,610
Godzilla dragons that look exactly the

248
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,649
same but the bad guy dragon is black and

249
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:35,939
the good one is white because that's

250
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,289
races don't make a children's movie

251
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,969
about dragons goring each other to death

252
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,289
if you don't have the guts to show blood

253
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,999
I guess there are other main characters

254
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,559
fighting in this huge battle but I guess

255
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,819
they're not important or they're flying

256
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,959
around waiting for the movie to pay

257
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,490
attention to them who knows this feels

258
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,809
like a bloody confusing battle where

259
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,839
nobody's dying all of this loss and for

260
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,309
what hiccup still thinks he can talk to

261
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:56,279
this guy to become unstoppable to rule

262
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,119
the world

263
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,430
I mean yeah if toothless is being

264
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,959
mind-controlled right now what's taking

265
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,339
him so long to kill hiccup moments

266
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,869
earlier we saw toothless's purple fire

267
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:05,669
wall completely obliterate several giant

268
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,499
weapons yet when stoic takes a toothless

269
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,149
fireball to the chest he still remains

270
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,309
entirely intact get away from him even

271
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:12,180
though it's totally obvious

272
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,589
toothless was mind-controlled hiccup

273
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,999
decides to blame him for dumb and

274
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,069
infuriating reasons he took all the

275
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,559
dragons not all of them since they

276
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,999
couldn't defeat Drago with hundreds of

277
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,259
adult dragons they're going to try and

278
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,149
defeat Drago with a few baby dragons and

279
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:25,409
based on how much time is left in the

280
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:26,579
movie and the kind of movie this is

281
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,399
they're probably going to succeed

282
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,090
bewilder base just

283
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,279
take control of these guys to their

284
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,010
babies they don't listen to anyone

285
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,690
oh sure let's just write our hopes on

286
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,000
that besides this is mine control not

287
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,950
real communication right also if they

288
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,240
don't listen to anyone how are you able

289
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
to ride them and guide them where they

290
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,940
need to go they'd be perfectly content

291
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,830
staying back on Pandora right the Alpha

292
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,060
is easily distracted sheep blink Oh

293
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,680
hypnotized dragons only see an

294
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,370
out-of-focus silent film the real you is

295
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,410
inside there somewhere cliche how are

296
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,350
you doing that movie magic also Drago is

297
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,520
letting him do this instead of flying

298
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,110
away or making the alpha male make

299
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,850
toothless hit in with a fireball there

300
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,140
are several other better options but

301
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,430
Drago seems to be a huge fan of

302
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,500
remaining stationary is he incapable of

303
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,630
being remind controlled now wait is this

304
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,010
movie saying as long as the Dragons

305
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,779
can't see the the wildebeest can't

306
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,490
control his brain the wind ripped this

307
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,529
blindfold between shots because first

308
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,210
there is no tear then suddenly there's a

309
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,770
tear hiccup saying is impossibly

310
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:31,070
impeccable this is Park goddamnit
