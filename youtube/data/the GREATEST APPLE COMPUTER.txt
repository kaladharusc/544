1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
i like what you guys got going on right here

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,510
yeah it's just

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,110
monday Monday Monday Monday

4
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,010
yeah

5
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,510
yeah

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,120
yeah

7
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,200
there are two tools I need to make videos

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,090
number one is a camera and number two is a computer

9
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,110
this was my first computer and I mac DVD had a 10 gig hard drive this thing was

10
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,340
amazing now this this is my second computer

11
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,910
this might have been one of the coolest computers that Apple ever date

12
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,230
look at this thing you guys remember this it's like a half of basketball in

13
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,860
this screen is on this floaty wingy wingy then I got this

14
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,750
which was the titanium power book powermac power mac book

15
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,910
I don't know what it's called but this is my first laptop that I used to baby

16
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,510
this thing I don't know how it got so destroyed

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:03,400
whoa but I broke it at some point in time and then retired it in 2007 from

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,940
there

19
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,130
I got this thing total power house this is what I ended the majority of the HBO

20
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,420
series are then i switched over this laptop after I stopped using it for

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,110
editing

22
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,739
I used to just leave like a picture slideshow playing but after like three

23
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,510
years the battery literally exploded then I replaced it with this this one

24
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,300
still works then this which definitely still works i still use this and now i

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,820
use this which is just an even newer one

26
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,560
also i have this chief I've tower here but it's all wired in so i couldn't take

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,190
it down

28
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,880
I do love a laptop for its portability but there's just something about sitting

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,709
down on a desktop and diving into work it just feels more formal it feels more

30
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,430
substantial and that's why I built this disaster behind me

31
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,030
I want to have like the best system i could possibly have to sit down and

32
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,070
tackle a more ambitious videos

33
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,950
I never really took advantage of this system I I think it's because i don't

34
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,360
like sitting back here

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,140
I built this office because I wanted privacy but I work alone in this space

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,650
now

37
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,030
I don't need privacy so today is a day I relocate the tower set up

38
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,319
this thing is a really cool object

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,270
this feels better I don't feel like I'm in a closet out here

40
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,810
in fact I feel like I'm there's a lot more work to do but this is a really

41
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,210
good start

42
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,210
yeah

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,890
yeah

44
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,970
marriage is sort of like a business right now Candace and I are organizing a

45
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,940
bunch of stuff together

46
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,940
i'm headed to her office right now to tackle a couple of

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,970
boring

48
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,390
the wife things

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,100
yeah

50
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,830
this

51
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,830
is this whole line for supreme

52
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,220

53
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,420

55
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,300

56
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,080
yeah it's not it's a special care

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,890
are we booking this now or not we do it right this very moment

58
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:53,270
let's do it how do you get anything done with your level of indecisiveness it

59
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,990
down

60
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,140

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,910
all right then i gotta go okay thanks for coming by really get anything done

62
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540

63
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,990
yeah

64
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,280
canvases South African she was born in South Africa

65
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,590
try to go back there at least once a year to see family and all that jazz

66
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,720
last year Kansas blue back alone with the baby and it did not go like she was

67
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,870
crying in the bathroom with a flight attendant watching the baby and we're

68
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,110
going time

69
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,129
that

70
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,399
so she's having a really tough time looking at this year she wants to find

71
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,510
like the perfect light

72
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,680
what we're supposed to leave it like 10 days and we haven't booked yet so

77
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,340

80
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,830

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,830
put in the top comment but that didn't make it

82
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,360
I don't know how you don't crash your drone every time you fly it like ID

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,080
Jesse

84
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,610
that's why i don't have the fancy one like you have well they're like learn

85
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,569
I got I don't want you want it crashes okay see that's the problem

86
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,740
you look out of the crisis yeah yeah still fun

87
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,830
I needed 60 mile winds and then crash

88
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,490
I hear the drone expert i can't fly it so bad flying drones like making a video

89
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,009
like sneaking out yet

90
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,520
chse and I made the aladdin video

91
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:09,249
and then we made the snowboard videos

92
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,300
so we try to come up with ideas for future videos the bar is just set really

93
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,099
high

94
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,180
I got to figure out to see here your home there is no crashing skateboard

95
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,960
right

96
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,710
mania with the YouTube community in New York City is not like it is in LA so

97
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,039
it's really awesome to see Jesse and to see other youtubers here in the city and

98
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,339
Jesse and I we're going to make something awesome together again

99
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,339
whenever we work together we do something great

100
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,370
yeah

101
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,449
guitar a lady has been thinking can she walk around anywhere
