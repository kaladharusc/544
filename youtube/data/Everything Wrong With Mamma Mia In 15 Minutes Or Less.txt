I have a dream this is the musical I

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,020
thought that was singing and dancing but

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,279
in more of a 10 Things I Hate About You

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,050
kind of way not a musical musical damn

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,980
if you have a song that helps you cope

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,170
with anything that is either fictional

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,790
nonsense that doesn't exist or else it's

in Bach there are no other options

between this lame is and Ted to I'm

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,739
starting to think a man deciphered has a

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,540
must sing during the film clause in her

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,500
before she realized that she was

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,510
expecting me yep I guess there's no use

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,890
in trying to track that asshole down

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,960
even though I'm baring his trouser also

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,370
better keep the child in the dark for

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,660
her whole life in the hopes that it'll

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,040
lead to an adorable musical Love

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,510
Actually meet up in the Mediterranean

someday honey honey nearly kills me oh

man a musical version of Jennifer's Body

27
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,850
has a lot less lesbian kissing in blood

28
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,140
the fact that a smoke monster doesn't

29
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,700
eat any of these girls while they sing

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,260
run through the woods like these girls

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,150
have never even heard of ticks rails

33
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,939
someone have new pictures of her or

34
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,049
something why is the Queen Mother

35
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,659
slumming in this discount grease no they

36
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,549
think that mom sent the invites listen

37
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,930
no one knows the power of boner is

38
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,100
better than me okay maybe Wilt

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,930
Chamberlain but the diary said they each

40
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,370
had one night with Donna over 20 years

41
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,290
ago and all of them come all the way out

42
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,000
here at a moment's notice not even

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,140
knowing the ultimate reason for the

44
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,850
invite I'm not saying it's impossible

45
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,250
but that's some strong boner power jump

46
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,330
from talking about your birth father

47
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,920
does singing about your honey is super

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,990
confusing and conflicting also I kind of

49
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,040
like this movie the first time I saw it

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
when it was called Muriel's full monty

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,180
Greek Wedding Crashers and I want my

52
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,470
father to give me away

53
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,090
god this movie's premise is so thin it

54
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,170
could have been built on an incongruous

55
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,750
band catalog also seriously what if one

56
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,860
or all these guys turn out to be

57
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,750
assholes couldn't Sophie an actor plan

58
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,909
well ahead of the actual wedding just to

59
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,710
make sure there weren't any issues well

60
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,560
no my father no you want look don't us

61
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
absolutely gonna kill you when she finds

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,830
out by the time she finds out it'll be

63
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,750
too late well Sophie don't get your

64
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,489
Drake content mixed up into this Abba

65
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,260

68
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,290
Jesus I'm pretty sure 68% of this movie

69
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,730
is comprised of character introductions

70
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,790
okay it's so much about you movie with

71
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,560
an a-list cast is somehow written by the

72
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,180
backup lighting crew from Days of Our

73
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,560
Lives why did you wear stilettos two

74
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,989
Greeks for any reason man anytime this

75
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,580
movie gets above 300 feet it turns a

76
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,080
degree in screen syndrome I'm designing

77
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,209
a website we just want this to be the

78
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,400
ultimate romantic destination this was

79
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,599
what's supposed to be the site of

the bills I have to pay Olli I

85
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,739
momentarily forgot this was a musical

86
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,269
I'm having Meryl Streep sing basically

87
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,860
the same note over and over and over is

88
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,879
not a great way to remind me if I got me

89
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,099
man damn this character turn should be

90
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,200
sued for whiplash Donna was just saying

91
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,760
she didn't want to be married and she's

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,019
let the candidates that fathered her

93
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,790
daughter just fuck off 20 years ago so

94
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,079
what's the sudden fascination with

95
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,340
landing a shark jeez they must have

96
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,840
spent at least 49 percent of the total

97
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,700
budget on boats alone for the wedding

98

oh man bills introduction comes with its

100
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,650
own zoom and enhance cliche how are the

101
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,970
other guys gonna compete with that I'm

102
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,500
not gonna lie these three are starting

103
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,910
to make a solid case for drinking at

104
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,940
11:00 a.m. are you being taken care of

105
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,319
this conversation just literally went

106
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,760
from do you need a loan - are you

107
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,549
getting any in seven seconds you go it's

108
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,750
amazing all three of these guys even

109
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,130
came to the wedding but the fact that

110
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,930
none of them right here and now says yep

111
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,549
I'm out of here is mathematically

112
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:50,239
impossible

113
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,010
I think the invites my mom doesn't know

114
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,720
anything and I assumed all of you had

115
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,919
the financial means to travel halfway

116
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,239
around the world to a remote location

117
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,889
that has to be very difficult to find

118
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,810
surprise all right just adorable though

119
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,750
promise me that you will not anybody

120
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,190
that

121
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,420
promised what is her plan here is there

122
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,950
any other explanation for them to all be

123
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,569
here that her mother will believe are

124
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,980
you planning to go with sheer ironic

125
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,390
coincidence one cannot forget everything

126
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,220
is the Iron Lady doing she just spied on

127
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,540
the three dudes she's been longing for

128
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,579
all in the same location on her property

129
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,790
and she's playing a game of peeping tom

130
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,040
Mamamia scene credits also I recognize

131
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,570
that millions of retirees enjoyed this

132
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,160
movie but those people are all stupid

133
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,240
she's definitely singing loudly enough

134
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,380
that the three men in the Attic should

135
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,639
have heard her and that's assuming they

136
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,080
didn't hear her footsteps on the roof

137
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,639
which they also definitely should hear

138
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,190
but whatever there's a fire within my

139
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,620
soul let's put Meryl Streep in this

140
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,790
musical it'll really give it some

141
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,160
gravitas okay but can she sing she's a

142
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,660
motive in song hmm

143
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,250
can she sing she's his passionate

144
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,660
singing is she is acting can she's

145
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,990
saying dog she can stay on pitch huh

146
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,729
sudden chorus of towns folk I remove a

147
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,990
thousand sins if they had a spontaneous

148
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,850
foursome right here and now you want me

149
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,310
to pitch it on that Mario Batali big

150
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,500
fella I'm old enough to be our mother

151
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,669
wait the hotel is apparently

152
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,169
hemorrhaging money and nothing works but

153
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,130
they're able to afford a full-time

154
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,900
bartender and an extremely well-stocked

155
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,169
bar

156
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,820
I know European priorities are different

157
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,930
still man I could have sworn I actually

158
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,550
like some of Ava's music before watching

159
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,410
this movie she got drunk at 11:00 a.m.

160
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,300
then saw three prominent ex-boyfriends

161
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,830
so naturally her friends try to fix all

162
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,539
that by getting her drunk again it's her

163
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,050
dad who's Sophie's dad damn Donna can't

164
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,190
even talk about her own daughter without

165
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,720
having to play the pronoun game also

166
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
though I guess since Donna still doesn't

167
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,270
know who the father is it'll ultimately

168
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,430
be Sophie's Choice but when I continue

169
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,050
the fucking ruse Donna knows that the

170
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,669
guys are here the guys know that Sophie

171
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,169
invited them and now Sophie knows that

172
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:44,490
Donna knows the guys are all here also

173
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,590
the wedding's tomorrow you don't want to

174
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,910
tie this loophole up with a little bit

175
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,370
of time to spare Sophie never finds out

176
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,380
incise Sophie of course already knows so

177
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,910
this entire movie is existing just

178
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,289
because people who would naturally talk

179
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,060
and share stories decide not to do that

180
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,190
I have brought this all on myself

181
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,560
because I was a stupid reckless little

182
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,750
slut actually that's kind of true but

183
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,310
still we don't tolerate slut-shaming

184
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,350
around here so all three of her best

185
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,909
previous lovers are in town and down to

186
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,530
she's acting like the world hates her

187
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,300
ass and needs extra convincing to even

188
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,620
venture out to her own daughters

189
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,240
bachelorette party come on I thought we

190
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,740
all agreed no more Merrill's jumping on

191
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,100
the bed

192
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,060
well she's fired I guess they had time

193
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,680
to plan this highly choreographed dance

194
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,449
on the trip down to the docks also

195
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:31,860
shouldn't Sophie be invited to the

196
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,479
dancing queen montage or who forgot

197
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,889
about the film's protagonist until it's

198
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,210
convenient to the script Riki in the

199
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,150
flash 1.0 we made our way along the

200
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,780
river and we sat down Colin Firth

201
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,310
singing voices like Kermit the Frog

202
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,350
doing a James Taylor impression it was

203
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,500
the edge of no regrets yeah back in

204
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,030
those days you could travel Europe write

205
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,800
some songs snuck up a few women and not

206
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,150
have to support them for decades good

207
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,600
times

208
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,860
no one will be seated during the young

209
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,750
girl in a bathing suit spends as a sexy

210
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,430
summer Greek day with three shirtless

211
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,870
old perverts portion of the movie I

212
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,570
wasn't jealous before we met god damn

213
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,039
this movie literally can't even go two

214
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,789
minutes without breaking into song waste

215
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,050
I'm not wasting them I'm pouring them

216
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,490
into this in writing and send aerating

217
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,320
which will generate views for us so I'm

218
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,729
actually making excellent proactive use

219
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,810
of the emotions you're crossing make

220
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,820
movie this entire sexy encounter occurs

221
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,990
within full view of her potential

222
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,700
fathers which should be gross for

223
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,450
everyone involved

224
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,130
but I'm just assuming everyone involved

225
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,870
has already ingested a large amount of

226
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,340
drugs I feel like Tom Cruise on the

227
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,200
plane when Rod Tidwell grabs his hand it

228
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,419
starts dance shouting like oh my god

229
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,650
discount Arsenio what have they ever

230
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,870
done for their daughter their own oh

231
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,490
these poor middle-aged moderately

232
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,110
attractive dudes are being tied up and

233
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,849
swooned over by young women seriously

234
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,380
who the fuck is this movie for you

235
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,490
should wait you should wait until she's

236
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,849
few drinks her first she's literally

237
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,010
been drunk all fucking day this is good

238
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,349
it's okay you love a real talent and

239
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,490
she's okay I don't know who my father is

240
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,340
oh I see these aren't the bridesmaids

241
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,360
from the bachelorette party

242
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,620
they're the screenwriters personal

243
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,270
convenience minions and why am I asking

244
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,530
this while being the featured table

245
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,000
dancer during an extremely loud song

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,770
while you clearly spent little money on

247
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,449
the green-screen and therefore minimal

248
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,590
money and time was spent on actual

249
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,039
grease

250
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,780
you've spent none on singing lessons I

251
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,490
guess all your budget went to Meryl

252
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,870
Streep and Pierce Brosnan in the boats

253
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,330
the kind of bachelor bachelorette party

254
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,340
combo both does this Lucille Ball eat

255
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,010
your heart out last night you you and

256
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,140
sky what's wrong I don't know what to do

257
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,390
you don't have to do anything this movie

258
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,399
is just song misunderstanding song

259
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,709
misunderstanding song misunderstanding

260
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,870
basically a lot like my sex life I have

261
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,000
two grown children I know something

262
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,380
about letting go Brosnan splaining they

263
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,020
seem so hard to fire god bless him but

264
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,970
pierce brosnan singing Sherpa sound like

265
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,330
a drunk David Bowie impersonator as the

266
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,770
first of the former flames to serenade

267
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,209
Donna and profess love for her it's

268
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,620
natural that Sam will be the one she

269
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,790
ends up with and probably the ultimate

270
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,410
father of the Sophie but this movie so

271
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,910
boring I bet I forget that and write us

272
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,079
in later about one of the other guys

273
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,149
probably being the true father sweet

274
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,680
worried about to get some John Woo gun

275
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,079
action no god damn it and something

276
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,000
happened in this fucking movie this

277
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,560
pedal boat is hilariously motorized

278
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,850
which is clear to anyone who ever

279
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,410
pedaled on a pedal boat but no one

280
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,089
involved in the making of this movie

281
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,170
this does your mother know that you're

282
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,480
out bull is the pervious song to ever /

283
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,399
the song was busted by Chris Hansen and

284
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,809
had to take a seat over there let's talk

285
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:42,610
about the blocking here people do you

286
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,259
think this is fifty enough or should we

287
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:51,160
be more overt man I'd get good money if

288
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,480
one of these characters suddenly bust

289
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,009
out singing Old Man River or even

290
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,600
something like I can only imagine losing

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,490
huh

292
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,330
skipper's wonderful adventure

293
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,370
in a strange move the Academy

294
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,200
reflexively showed up on set during the

295
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,150
scene to get Meryl her annual Oscar you

296
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,890
think I'm letting you down well it

297
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,360
depends why are you talking to the

298
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,470
audience or to your mom

299
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,510
when I got pregnant my mother told me

300
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,180
not to bother coming back sounds like a

301
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,100
bad mom for sure but I can't help but

302
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,050
wonder if you wanted to go back give him

303
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,580
the life of free love you were living in

304
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,320
Greece sure you were pregnant but I feel

305
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,580
like you suddenly calling your mommy at

306
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,660
that point is kind of way out of

307
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,740
character I'm surprised your mother

308
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,350
didn't reply by saying who was this

309
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,840
sometimes I wish that I couldn't freeze

310
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,040
the picture Oh God not me

311
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,630
I wish I could fast-forward it this

312
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,130
movie was nominated for best donkey in

313
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,080
2008 and in one of the biggest shocks of

314
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,880
the Year ceremony lost at Gran Torino

315
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,430
and Jack Nicholson said Wow down the

316
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,140
dusty dirt road the donkey drove Donna's

317
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,490
daring daughter to her draconian

318
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,720
dedication deed school bag in hand now

319
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,520
we are remembering the song she

320
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,350
literally just sang three movie minutes

321
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,230
ago I don't want to talk well certainly

322
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,000
don't sing then that's gonna take even

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,980
longer why not take

324
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,060
the loser has to fall um by the way you

325
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,530
know the wedding processions like

326
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,330
halfway up that mountain right how long

327
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,470
are you expecting the song to take

328
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,210
donnas so angry is singing this song at

329
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,770
Sam that it's obvious he's the one she

330
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,030
really loves and probably the girl's

331
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,410
father though this movie is so boring

332
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,730
I'm probably gonna forget saying that

333
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,200
and later will write us in about how one

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,340
of the other dudes is clearly a real

335
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,560
father

336
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,750
[Music]

337
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,250
these lyrics like all the songs in this

338
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,690
movie don't match the story or the

339
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,160
characters very much at all takes it all

340
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,990
he's had a good life sure but she bought

341
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,150
a fucking villa in an island and had a

342
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,680
daughter and drunk girlfriends and I

343
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,790
don't feel like their breakup left

344
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,500
things as lopsided as this song suggests

345
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,160
is what I'm saying

346
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,230
also whoa little make sure to stretch

347
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,850
before you pulled out Celine Dion fist

348
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:56,660
pump you don't want to pull a hammy

349
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,339
damn Donna fucking sprinted all that way

350
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,990
up the steep slope and is still able to

351
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,610
belt out this lyric who's her trainer

352
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,290
and what kind of steroids did they jack

353
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,360
her up with a trumpet a baritone and an

354
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,490
alto sax this is the worst wedding band

355
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,920
ever Stanley filming cameos for movies

356
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,350
MCU and beyond since 2008 so these other

357
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,149
two are here and just decided off-camera

358
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,680
not to try and walk her down the aisle

359
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,879
happen to that hilarious

360
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,449
misunderstanding subplot movie with

361
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,180
hundreds of men honestly for an attendee

362
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,029
best wedding ever but I told her rain I

363
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,889
couldn't marry her and I came right back

364
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,019
so what you're saying is this movie's

365
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,309
biggest misunderstandings have been

366
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,139
going on for decades not minutes why am

367
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,970
I even surprised also Sam's the first

368
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,079
one to speak up at the wedding which

369
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,279
means he's definitely going to be the

370
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,360
one that ends up with Donna and it's

371
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,620
probably also the true father of the

372
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,029
girl though the movie is boring enough

373
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,749
we can find out if you want then do it

374
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:47,399
oh my god this movie's gonna end with

375
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,809
everyone deciding to accept the fact

376
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,009
that they are all her father and never

377
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,569
find out for sure and I'm gonna break a

378
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:54,660
motherfucking television I made two I'll

379
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,519
take your third a beat I'll go a

380
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,639
cappella kappapa doc o'clock a trailer

381
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,980
everybody y'all if you doubt me I'm a

382
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,839
piece of YouTube critic trash I say it

383
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,089
proudly this movie I don't want a sin

384
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,290
I'm outta here tell these people

385
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,490
something they don't know about me I

386
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,680
mean last time we saw Skyy her groom he

387
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,209
was kind of pissed about her having made

388
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,470
this wedding all about finding out who

389
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,059
her dad was instead of her love for him

390
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,889
then a few scenes and now we're here and

391
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,240
he should be pissed right now is what

392
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,199
I'm saying but this movie somehow

393
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,579
manages to forget even more of itself

394
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,769
than I did I'm not entirely sure what's

395
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,480
happening right now damn it when will

396
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,620
the screenwriters stop letting their

397
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,850
margin notes make it into the actual

398
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,250
fucking script I'm a divorced man who's

399
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:36,230
loved you for 21 years

400
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,879
hi I'm maybe your dad and definitely

401
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,589
your mom and complimented your art and I

402
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,790
know it's your wedding day and your

403
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,259
wedding reception and three men just

404
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,579
interrupted your wedding ceremony to

405
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,019
argue about who was your father and who

406
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,579
loved your mom and who was gay but might

407
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,959
I trouble you by asking the favor of

408
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,399
letting me take the spotlight at this

409
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,139
moment to sing to your mom a song that

410
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,220
has nothing to do with you or your

411
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,459
husband or your marriage Thanks oh yeah

412
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,959
I even know what passes for a plot is

413
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,100
over and done with there are still a

414
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,269
couple of mob hits that haven't been

415
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,670
played also this bodes terrifically for

416
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,370
the sequel Oh No Sophie's leaving um I

417
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,410
guess I don't know why she's stealing

418
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,759
away under the shroud of darkness but

419
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,259
maybe she had a secret scroll she

420
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,399
to deliver to the Prime Minister of

421
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:22,879
Malaysia or something safe travels you

422
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,119
