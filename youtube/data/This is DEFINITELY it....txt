1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,100
*intense music* THIS IS IT.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,120
This is FINALLY it. This is it AGAIN.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,560
This is the moment that you've all been waiting for.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,220
? ? ? ? ?

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,340

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,880
B A B E H

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,880
And, in addition to that, you've got two brand spankin' new items:

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,900
THIS BEANIE,

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,780
and the infamous quarter zip, available in two luscious colors.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,900
The comfort!

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,680
The fit!

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,500
The NWEUPS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)-

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,720
Hey guys, my name is Markiplier, and today marks the official launch of cloakbrand.com

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,840
And Cloak in general.

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
This is it, like, this IS the day.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,440
Last time, if there's anybody that's confused,

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,900
last time we were talking about the brand at first.

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:50,720
We did a pre-sale, we opened up the website, but now is when things actually get moving.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,060
And it's exciting!

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,280
It really is. It's exciting to see because this is the day

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,460
when all of the work that we've done for the past two years finally hits the ground, and it's running.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,200
Everybody that preordered their stuff will be getting their, like, getting their new clothes as early as next week.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,540
And if you go to the website right now, cloakbrand.com, you can start ordering everything that you didn't get a chance to before.

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,340
Everything sold out in like 2 days last time.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,140
And that blew us away. We had no idea that things were going to be like that,

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,940
we thought it was going to be a slower burn towards the launch day, which is today.

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,620
But you guys didn't.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,880
Cuz you guys always push past what we expect you to do.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,680
You guys always exceed everything that we could possibly hope for.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,020
You guys are so unbelievably supportive of what we do,

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,780
and that means the world to us.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,140
Honestly, truly, that means the world to us.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,640
We can't thank you enough for supporting this new venture of ours.

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,120
And-And we know this may seem out of our element for you guys,

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,580
but this is something that we've been passionate about.

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,020
For years.

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,240
Something we've wanted, something we've assembled a great team of people for.

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,960
And... you guys supported it.

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,060
And I can't say how much that means to us.

42
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,220
I cannot overstate...

43
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,380
how important that belief is to us.

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,760
Because we never want to betray that trust that you guys put in us,

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,200
and we always wanna make stuff for you that we're proud to make.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,460
And that is the whole point of Cloak. We wanted to make stuff that we would wanna wear.

47
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,980
We wanna make stuff that we're proud to show off.

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,360
We wanna make stuff that we're proud to make for you.

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,540
And that's what we've done.

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,060
And when people first start getting their things next week, I think you guys are going to be blown away.

51
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,120
I cannot wait for you to see it.

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,880
It is something... that we never thought we'd be able to do, and yet, we've done it.

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,180
And it's only because of you guys.

54
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,920
So thank you so much. I've got nothing else special to say,

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,300
oh, I guess I do. We have new beanies in stock,

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,140
if you go to cloakbrand.com with the launch, we've got new items,

57
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,640
uh..

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,060
every time that we wanna get, like, a restock, we wanna try to put new items out as often as we can.

59
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,080
Now, this may be, like, a couple items every quarter, every few months or so,

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,340
but we will do what we can, when we can. We've got a plan, and hopefully we can stick to it, but we've got a plan.

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,920
And in this part of the plan, we've got new beanies, available at cloakbrand.com, and new quarter zips.

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,320
So if you go to cloakbrand.com or click the link in the description below,

63
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,160
you can get this lovely, luscious, new cloak brand quarter zip.

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,960
And it's available in black as well, so it's available in gray and black.

65
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,080
And down the road, hopefully, we will be adding new items sooner than you guys expect,

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,780
so check in with all the social media channels for Cloak,

67
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,700

Honestly, thank you so much for believing in us.

Thank you for believing in Cloak. Thank you for preordering, thank you for supporting us,

just thank you.

For being there when we needed you.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,740
And for believing in what we believe in.

74
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,340
So thank you again,

75

I will see you, in the next video.

77
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,000
BUH-BYE~ !!
