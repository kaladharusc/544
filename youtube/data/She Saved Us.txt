whatever you do don't make a fuss at the

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,350
door I I got it so I got into a massive

91
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,150
fight with my girlfriend at the time

92
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,760
then long story short I ended up running

93
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,890
away from her dad in her house and I

94
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,960
jumped over the fence and I broke my

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
foot and then I phoned you and I was

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,680
like dude do you think I can still go to

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,510
the photo room so to try and apologize

98
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,050
to her I put on a tuxedo with no shoe

99
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,300
cuz I had my broken foot and I was like

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,830
dragging it through the bottom of the

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,260
hotel and I was like I'm coming in and

102
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,270
they were like no you not and I was like

103
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,400
no but I know Casey Neistat and then

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,100
eventually I got into the room but it

105
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,600
caused a massive big problem and I

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,950
actually never ended up getting back

107
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,720
together with that it goes yeah so

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,820
that's that hope that was like the first

109
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,919
time we met it was it was entirely a

110
