1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,589
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,480
YouTube boogie2988 coming atcha live was

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,009
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,450
and if you're not familiar with Shane

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,730
Dawson and his docu-series that he has

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,440
done here on YouTube you really should

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,120
be they he's done some really amazing

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,429
stuff focusing on like tannic on one of

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,410
my favorite creators graveyard girl and

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,289
now most recently he's focused on a very

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,910
polarizing figure here on YouTube

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,000
Jake Paul in this series is absurdly

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,060
popular getting 10 15 20 million views

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,859
per episode so I'm sure you've already

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,570
heard of it but will summarize it just

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,340
in case now this series has a lot in

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,690
common with the other series that Shane

18
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,190
has done he picks a polarizing figure

19
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,440
like Tana mojo or Jeffrey star and then

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,600
focuses on them and humanizes them and

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,670
shows you the good and the bad about

22
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,469
that person this is Jake Paul

23
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,730
documentary is a little different though

24
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,020
because it has focused quite a bit on

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,579
the bad and if for some reason you're

26
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,260
unfamiliar with Jake Paul that's Logan's

27
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,000
little brother and I'm sure you know

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,170
quite a bit about Logan Paul at this

29
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,820
point because he's made national news

30
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,280
with this antics in Japan I would even

31
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,109
say the name of that forest but you know

32
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,489
the one I'm talking about and if you're

33
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,780
not familiar to Jake you can get

34
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,640
familiar by watching Shane's series but

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,350
he has been accused of all kinds of

36
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,049
messed up stuff us by ex-girlfriends by

37
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,549
people who are on his team ten by

38
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,100
friends and family members the the guy

39
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,450
is certainly controversial he's done

40
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,250
some pretty incredibly stupid stuff and

41
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,689
a lot of that stupid stuff has been

42
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,850
documented right here on youtube and you

43
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,290
don't need to take a lot of it out of

44
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,939
context a lot of the stuff he's done in

45
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,430
the videos has been crazy over-the-top

46
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,220
just absurd stuff I guess I'm supposed

47
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,619
to insert like a collage of like Jake

48
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,360
setting stuff on fire in a pool and

49
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,040
breaking down walls in a mansion and

50
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,540
spitting in a girl's face

51
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,310
you can watch Jane's documentary for

52
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,869
that I don't have the editing skills for

53
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,250
that but when Shane announced this

54
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,780
documentary a lot of people were afraid

55
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,909
that he was going to do for Jake Paul

56
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,130
what he did for Geoffrey star or the

57
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,710
graveyard girl or even Dana Mojo show

58
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,380
their side of things humanized them make

59
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,570
you reconsider your perceptions about

60
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,640
them and a lot of people really did not

61
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,049
want to run the risk of that happening

62
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,689
with Jake Paul but here's the thing the

63
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,430
series is not over yet and I think by

64
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,990
the end of this series there's no way

65
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,670
they can make Jake Paul look good

66
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,649
they'll definitely humanize him they

67
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,000
will show you some of the reasons he's

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
made some of the stupid mistakes that

69
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,390
he's made but that doesn't change the

70
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,400
fact that he like me like many other

71
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,680
people have done and said some real

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,019
stupid crap but if you already hate Jake

73
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,519
Paul and you go into this series

74
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,680
watching it I think you'll still hate

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,150
Jake Paul but you're going to be given a

76
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,920
lot of new information that will

77
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,379
challenge that idea you're gonna find

78
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,579
out that a lot of the stuff that they

79
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,829
have done was exaggerated you'll find

80
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,670
out a lot of the stuff that you've done

81
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,530
has been faked you'll find out that a

82
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,810
lot of the drama that surrounds team ten

83
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,459
and some of the stuff that TeamTennis

84
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,430
said is just absolutely not true and

85
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,750
it's it's heartbreaking to hear that

86
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,340
stuff but you really have to ask

87
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,900
yourself the question is faking that

88
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,639
stuff any better than actually doing

89
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,769
that stuff and if so how much better

90
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,840
because you're still convincing an

91
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,310
audience of tens of millions of people

92
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,530
that that stuff is real and I do know

93
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,849
that a lot of people can be very upset

94
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,099
about that but can we really should we

95
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,720
really be because you know obviously I

96
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,060
have my own fake series here on YouTube

97
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,010
my Francis videos they are over-the-top

98
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,810
and exaggerated for purpose and I'm open

99
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,579
about the fact that they are fake but

100
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:06,810
then you have other friends of mine like

101
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,969
mcjuggernuggets who has the psycho kids

102
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,340
series where he pretends to be crazy and

103
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,750
psychotic and his family pretends to be

104
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,120
crazy a psychotic or it may be our

105
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
collaborations together where I pretend

106
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,449
to be a murderer for the sake of pranks

107
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,340
well beyond that almost everybody you

108
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,859
follow on social media youtubers Twitter

109
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,209
people instagrams

110
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,310
they always exaggerate certain points

111
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,810
they always exaggerate certain aspects

112
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,970
of who they are they lie by omission

113
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,250
you know everybody is fake to some

114
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,769
extent on social media every video is

115
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,319
edited almost every Instagram photo has

116
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,569
been edited in some way run through some

117
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,159
filters to make the person look better

118
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,449
but that's not anyone I'm talking about

119
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,549
I mean even your friends and family they

120
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,379
upload their best moments to Instagram

121
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,659
and social media they don't upload their

122
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,009
worst moments they don't they don't

123
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:52,349
upload when they're sad crying and look

124
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,540
ugly where their makeup is running they

125
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,189
don't talk about their depressed days or

126
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,199
their frustrated days most people try to

127
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,090
make their lives look way more fun and

128
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,229
way more interesting than they actually

129
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,299
are a lot of people show their vacation

130
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,069
photos not a lot of people show their

131
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,599
work photos and if they do it's when

132
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,370
something good happens at work maybe not

133
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,079
every single person is that way online

134
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,290
but 99.9% of people are I genuinely

135
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,109
believe that I know my friends I know my

136
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,239
family I know the other Creators I do I

137
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,009
follow and all of us try to put our best

138
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,500
foot forward and and leaving the ugly

139
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,990
sad parts our relies behind because a

140
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,130
lot of us just aren't comfortable

141
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,930
sharing that

142
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,520
stuff but considering that everybody

143
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,889
omits stuff in social media is it any

144
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,259
real surprise that a youtuber like Jake

145
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,090
Paul the character you've known as Jake

146
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,740
Paul the person you perceive as Jake

147
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,229
Paul doesn't actually exist and then

148
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,460
when you watch the Shane Dawson

149
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,720
documentary you find out that he has a

150
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,789
flawed family and a flawed upbringing

151
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,410
and that he's actually really nice to

152
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,419
the girl he's dating and nice to his

153
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,340
friends and that he's a well-rounded

154
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,100
individual and not just the butthole he

155
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,080
plays here on the internet or the the

156
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,090
monster you have created in your mind

157
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,100
did you honestly think that boogeyman

158
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,160
actually exists and if you did that's

159
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,320
that's sad but you certainly didn't

160
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,039
think there would be one of the most

161
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,180
watched people on YouTube if they were

162
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,150
that way did you come on mother reality

163
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,190
is a lot of the things that Jake does

164
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,680
are very unsavory if they are not smart

165
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,539
or good things whether it's the

166
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,039
character of Jake Paul or the real

167
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,500
person that is Jake Paul that we've seen

168
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,210
here in the documentary at the end of

169
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,560
the day the guy has done some real

170
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,720
damage he's really hurt some people he's

171
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,180
made stuff look really stupid and more

172
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,710
importantly I think he's made his

173
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,810
audience believe that some of the stuff

174
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,909
that he did in his videos was really him

175
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,710
and a lot of people emulate him and a

176
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,539
lot of people think maybe it's okay to

177
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,570
do that kind of stuff hopefully not but

178
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,949
some do what dozen of the reasons I've

179
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,380
always been so open about my fresas

180
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,630
character being fake because if I wasn't

181
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,370
I would feel horribly horribly guilty

182
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,409
about it because I would be afraid that

183
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,360
people would emulate that I you know

184
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,099
certainly certainly would not want that

185
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,080
even when YouTube was telling me if I

186
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,490
did only the Francis videos that I've

187
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,039
become a household name I'd rather tell

188
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,300
the truth I become an asshole name

189
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,759
honestly but nice to have all that money

190
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,169
though the other thing that I really

191
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,060
hope they hammer home with the ending of

192
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,800
this Shane Dawson documentary is the

193
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,330
fact that I genuinely believe he was

194
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,180
raised by what appears to be narcissists

195
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,009
based on their videos and I don't mean

196
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,690
the kind of narcissists who you know you

197
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,889
see on YouTube every day that are

198
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,300
claimed to be narcissists but I mean

199
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,780
actual genuine narcissists you don't

200
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,800
know this already there's a big

201
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,210
difference between the way people use

202
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,190
the term narcissists and the actual

203
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,590
definition of people with a narcissistic

204
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,169
personality disorder it's a pretty big

205
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,729
difference there but I think Jake's

206
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,210
parents definitely fit the criteria when

207
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,710
I watched Shane's documentary and I see

208
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,210
his parents and I look at all the

209
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,409
research and stuff that I seen online

210
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,340
about his pair

211
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,870
they do look like they had good

212
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,010
intentions that were raising their

213
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,440
children to focus on living big lives

214
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,750
and becoming famous and rich and being

215
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,060
successful and and really drove them to

216
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,400
that but it came down to be like kind of

217
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,470
a Jackson 5 situation and it looks like

218
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,060
instead of bettering them it was to

219
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,919
their detriment it looks like Jake and

220
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,690
Logan are worse off because of it

221
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,699
they're certainly successful but maybe

222
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,110
they don't have all the skills they need

223
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,150
to cope with that success not that any

224
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,310
of us would be doing any better at that

225
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,229
age you know 21 23 with that kind of

226
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,610
Fame and that kind of power and that

227
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,350
kind of money we would all probably be

228
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,300
making the world a much worse place than

229
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,400
Jake is so let's just let's just be

230
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,470
honest there but the way Shane Dawson

231
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,500
has portrayed Jake Paul here kind of

232
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
reminds me of Michael Scott from the

233
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,550
office in a lot of ways he just seems to

234
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,070
be desperately wanting attention and

235
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,570
desperately wanting friends and

236
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,010
desperately wanting people he can trust

237
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,860
and love and I won't lie I can relate to

238
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,720
that but what I really think we've seen

239
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,400
here in this Shane Dawson documentary is

240
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,169
hopefully there's an opportunity for the

241
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,000
next stage of Jake's life hopefully

242
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,310
Logan's life as well where they choose

243
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,039
to do better things with that power with

244
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,720
that money to try to provide a much

245
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,030
better and healthier and happier message

246
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,410
than the one they've done they've done a

247
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,660
lot of outlandish stuff most of it

248
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,760
appears to be faked based on what we've

249
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,250
seen here but regardless I still don't

250
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,630
know how I feel about that but all that

251
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,669
said maybe it's time for the outlandish

252
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,620
stuffs to stop and maybe we start doing

253
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,539
outlandish really good things outlandish

254
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,820
ly positive things things with positive

255
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,800
messages behind them and it looks like

256
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,630
Jake is the kind of person who might

257
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,630
really consider that moving forward and

258
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,070
I hope that he does I really do that's

259
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,360
all I've ever wanted for Jake and Logan

260
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,560
and that's what I want for him now

261
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,970
because that would be good for the

262
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,200
platform it would be good for his

263
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,639
viewers it'd be good for the world to be

264
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,710
putting some real positivity into the

265
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,910
world to help make up for some of the

266
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,830
negativity they put in the world instead

267
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,419
here's what I will say was most

268
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,340
eye-opening about all of this though is

269
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,740
how many people do not want their

270
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,409
perceptions of people challenged I know

271
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,539
whenever I make a stupid mistake people

272
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,539
are often so angry so frustrated because

273
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,400
they haven't built up to be some sort of

274
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
mr. Rogers of YouTube and I'm certainly

275
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,740
not that I'm anything but that but Jake

276
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,450
is built up to be the boogeyman of

277
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,310
YouTube probably his brother Logan more

278
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,230
so but when they do good

279
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,240
it challenges people's perceptions and

280
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,550
it angers them they get so angry and if

281
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,660
you are the kind of person that gets

282
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,029
angry when someone challenges your

283
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,279
perceptions then buddy you need to be

284
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,870
challenging of perceptions way more

285
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,360
often because you'd be so surprised how

286
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,980
much of what we think about this world

287
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,500
is just not true especially because it's

288
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,610
been filtered through YouTube through

289
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,500
the media through our friends and

290
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,449
through our own misperceptions you

291
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,519
should dig deep on everything that is

292
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,320
handed to you especially stuff like

293
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,899
internet celebrities come on come on you

294
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:24,860
have to know there's so much

295
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,930
misinformation out there you can't

296
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,000
possibly believe it you shouldn't anyway

297
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
and that's what I appreciate Shane for

298
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,389
if feels like he's really cutting

299
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,370
through that misinformation to do a deep

300
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,139
dive to get some real truth and some

301
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:38,690
real information and boy I sure hope it

302
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,920
keeps doing and I look forward to the

303
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,449
next project after Jay Paul and I can't

304
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,339
wait to watch the rest of this and so

305
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,740
interesting that's so much of what we

306
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,350
thought was Jake Paul was meant for in

307
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,889
this information he spread himself

308
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,269
gotcha all right it's going to wrap it

309
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,410
up for this video do me a favor there's

310
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,910
a comment section down below and I would

311
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,680
love to know what you think about this

312
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,029
docu-series what you think about what

313
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:01,730
Shane Dawson is doing I personally love

314
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,290
that Shane is doing this and I know it

315
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,269
really adds to the drama fication of

316
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,100
youtube but it's the other side of the

317
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,019
coin rather than trying to do damage it

318
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,209
really feels like Shane is trying to

319
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,829
heal view tube here and make the

320
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,290
platform and the website and some of its

321
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,720
celebrities much better people I feel

322
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,220
like Shane is choosing to be a doctor or

323
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,010
a medic or a nurse here and boy Shane I

324
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,959
love you for it I really do if you're

325
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,310
not watching that series I do recommend

326
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,540
you go watch it or check out some of the

327
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,890
other stuff shane has uploaded in the

328
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,870
