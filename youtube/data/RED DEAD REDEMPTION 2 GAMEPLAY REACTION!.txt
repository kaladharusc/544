1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,429
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,080
YouTube boogie2988 coming at you levels

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,430
again through the power of the internet

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,290
and I never do this because it doesn't

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,910
perform very well in the channel but I'm

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,170
gonna make a special exception for this

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,370
game it's Red Dead Redemption

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,380
- and I'm super excited potentially game

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,120
of the year film this live on Twitch

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,440
while everybody watches by the way is my

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,520
second attempt because I got a donation

12
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,020
in the middle of it if you have not seen

13
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,460
this trailer on your own you should go

14
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,230
watch it somewhere go watch it on your

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,510
own right now instead of watching it

16
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,490
here because I'm going to pause and talk

17
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,619
about individual things as we watch this

18
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,000
so go watch it somewhere else you can

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,230
watch with the PlayStation Channel Xbox

20
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,520
channel GameSpot channel I'm watching it

21
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,840
on the GameSpot channel right now and

22
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,450
then we're gonna break it down as we go

23
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,739
to the stuff that I find most

24
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,780
interesting to me here we go let's get

25
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:48,510
into it so presumably this is the new

26
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,239
guy he's no Marsten but who knows

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,649
America was evolving on its way to

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,480
becoming the most powerful country in

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,609
the world beautiful new immigrants

30
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,890
arrived thriving outposts became towns

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,320
and civilization was spreading rapidly

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,040
into the huge wild and lawless frontier

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,840
alright so first off they showed us more

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,340
in the first 30 seconds of this trailer

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,259
then you'll see everywhere and I gotta

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,330
say at the end of this trailer they do

37
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,150
say this is running on this is running

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,430
on in game engine and that isn't

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,450
necessarily mean it's running on a

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,250
PlayStation Xbox one but it does look

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,570
absolutely incredible these graphics are

42
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,460
incredible but so far we've already seen

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,630
night and day we've already seen some

44
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,130
explosions we've seen some really great

45
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,680
graphics Rockstar always notice just to

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,970
make some really amazing graphics

47
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,530
especially for the single player that's

48
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,820
what I was worried about this game I was

49
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,780
worried that there were going to make it

50
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,700
single player in it it looks very single

51
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,930
play around we still don't know what

52
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,820
multiplayer is gonna look like but the

53
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,200
single-player stuff looks so good

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,290
already with Red Dead Redemption -

55
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,689
Rockstar Games aims to create look at

56
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,280
these mountains and look at this

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,549
beautiful world this is gorgeous alright

58
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,280
watch as he rolls in the mud and the mud

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,110
gets on his clothes now surely that's a

60
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,320
cutscene but not really because then you

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,759
immediately go into what looks like

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,670
actual combat

63
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,319
look at these footprints left in the

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,240
snow did you see those footprints left

65
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,780
in the snow

66
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,930
stuff like that the dirt getting rolled

67
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,700
into his clothing as he rolls out the

68
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,250
window which is just a costume change

69
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,650
realistically but it looks gorgeous

70
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,150
the the the tracks in the snow we've

71
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,040
seen that done in games before horizon

72
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,770
zero dawn comes to mind but gorgeous

73
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,319
nonetheless it's details like that that

74
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,150
really make a rockstar game a rockstar

75
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,709
game most people when they make a really

76
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,810
giant game they don't do the details

77
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,500
Rockstar manages to I wish it was a PC

78
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,330
version but uh but this version of this

79
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,250
game is I mean it looks gorgeous

80
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,560
if the game holds up keep in mind the

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,040
final product may not look like this but

82
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,080
[Music]

83
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,489
combat seems much improved but we'll

84
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,660
talk about it as we get further into the

85
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,380
trailer I've already seen this trailer I

86
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,610
love the idea of working with a whole

87
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,410
gang and keeping a whole gang happy and

88
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,670
adding more players to your gang and

89
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,440
more characters your gang great idea

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,209
reminds me of Fallout 4 as an attempt to

91
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,310
capture this pivotal moment when the Age

92
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,440
of Outlaws was ending and the modern

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,370
world was born there is a huge world to

94
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,650
explore site across a range of America's

95
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,530
heartland and frontier now they've shown

96
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,880
us a lot art at this point we've already

97
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,079
seen weather effects we've already seen

98
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,070
lighting effects we've already seen

99
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,840
night and day we've seen all kinds of

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,560
cool stuff this looks massive the

101
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,970
problem is whenever they have a giant

102
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,910
version of a game like this sometimes

103
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,280
the world is pretty empty I really hope

104
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,600
this world does not turn out to be empty

105
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,680
now it seems like there's plenty of

106
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,820
people in the cities and it seems like

107
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,930
there's plenty of people in the caymans

108
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,220
and it seems like there's plenty of

109
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,530
wildlife in between those areas but I

110
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,180
hope there's a lot of more interesting

111
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,980
stuff I hope they take a note from like

112
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,350
breath of the wild where there's just

113
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,430
got to be interesting stuff and

114
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,959
interesting people in between the major

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,170
plot points of the major areas I hope so

116
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,720
I hope it's not designed like a Ubisoft

117
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,070
game which has a lot of empty space with

118
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,120
nothing interesting to do just

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,940
collectibles from harsh mountain trails

120
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,000
and dense forests to untain swamp lands

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,190
and sweeping deserts and we know that

122
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,620
they've improved hauntings

123
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,790
but let's take a minute to look at the

124
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,640
city so obviously this is a period of

125
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,750
time or electricity it's not going to be

126
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,010
in every encampment but there's going to

127
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,390
be a few cities that are lit up like

128
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,970
this at night wow this is incredible

129
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,720
wow this is gorgeous I love just the

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
environmental effects are really

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,330
incredible now we're out to see a cast

132
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,740
of characters and let's see if you can

133
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,030
recognize some of these characters and

134
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,830
if they have analogues in the real world

135
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,000
because one immediately comes to mind

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,890
that's Edison I'll show you I'm tired

137
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,040
are all populated with a diverse cast of

138
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,020
characters from turn-of-the-century look

139
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,290
like Thomas Edison kind of you doesn't

140
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,110
look like a but that would be that would

141
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,540
be interesting though again look at the

142
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,090
wagon wheels I just leaving trails in

143
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,290
the month that's gorgeous that's

144
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:11,530
incredible each time they're forced to

145
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,930
flee an area the gang sets up a camp as

146
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,910
a base I love that idea as well burrs

147
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,540
eat sleep perform chores play games and

148
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:30,940
share stories so the idea of going out

149
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,250
and collecting gang members to add to

150
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,919
your camp to add your stuff that sounds

151
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,450
amazing to me that sounds fantastic to

152
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,580
me like I said it reminds me of Fallout

153
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,030
4

154
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,160
a lot of little subplots a lot of little

155
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,960
so quests I hope that they learned a

156
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,850
little something from Witcher 3 which in

157
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,990
the hopes of there's like branching

158
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,100
storylines that effect further

159
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,720
storylines down the road rather than

160
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,190
just one consequential story like you

161
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,570
saw in the last Grand Theft Auto game

162
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,240
that's wishful thinking I think but it

163
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,830
would be really cool if things depending

164
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,000
on which characters you collected which

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
characters you met which characters you

166
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,370
pissed off which characters you have

167
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,280
happy that would be really great but

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,780
that seems like it's asking a lot it's

169
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,490
asking them to not just create an

170
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,990
incredibly gorgeous game but also make

171
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,340
it as deep as The Witcher 3 which just

172
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,770
seems impossible but let's hope for the

173
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,130
best

174
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,780
these are the people our third calls

175
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,790
family and you will get to know each

176
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,540
gang member over the course of the game

177
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,330
so you saved the silly bastards laughing

178
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,730
you and him go Robin she helping the

179
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,680
camp with food and supplies will keep

180
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,630
morale high while spending time with

181
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,310
other gang members can reveal new

182
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,470
secrets fun things to do and

183
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,630
opportunities for mischief we're already

184
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,940
seeing a ton of minigames and many

185
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,790
quests and many stuff that's to the

186
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,710
player okay okay so all right any time

187
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,000
we ever see a fat guy in a video game

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,350
I'm gonna be excited about that can we

189
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,670
talk about the fat guy in the video game

190
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,320
there's a fat guy in the video game I

191
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,610
think it would be really hard to get

192
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,530
that fat at this period of time I hope

193
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,810
he has like a corn farm or something

194
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,340
like that like how did you manage to get

195
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,950
that fat buddy

196
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,330
but either way it's just nice to see a

197
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,320
fat guy in a video game

198
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,870
thank you rock star I hope his name is

199
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,880
Mookie thank you and your guns aren't

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,380
the only way to interact with the

201
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:17,060
environment call out to a passing Rider

202
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,990
all right so look at the bottom

203
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,520
right-hand corner you're gonna see aim

204
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,420
weapon as r2 you're gonna see I can't

205
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,500
read the make that out the other one is

206
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,170
they antagonize so this is very similar

207
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,330
to the bully system where you could

208
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,070
basically either provoke somebody or

209
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,350
appease somebody in the game bully I

210
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,180
think that's great so you can basically

211
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,710
upset somebody until they attack or you

212
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,030
can attack them or you could try to make

213
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,950
them happy or you can just try to right

214
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,380
on by and there's a lot of interactivity

215
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,360
with the different NPC's that's a great

216
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
system that's a really good sense I wish

217
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,140
that was in Grand Theft Auto local tough

218
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,660
guy or out of trouble with a town

219
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,420
sheriff or intimidate a witness into

220
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,390
silence and more so earlier it said

221
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,680
greet if you see in the bottom right

222
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,750
corner now we have threatened I can't

223
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,220
make up the next one the next one is

224
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,790
beat and so again this is just a great

225
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,140
way to interact with characters in the

226
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,480
game and I think it's a real straight

227
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
you're gonna timid eight them you could

228
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,450
attack them you can I mean that's it's

229
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,100
basically the bully system and I love it

230
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,390
I think that's absolutely a brilliant

231
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,460
addition to any game open-world game

232
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,830
otherwise sure

233
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,480
[Music]

234
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,590
confrontations can be escalated or

235
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,690
diffused we have Rob antagonize

236
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,300
friendships or make enemies as you

237
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,820
choose since have constitute err and

238
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,409
then and it's up to you the option to

239
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,969
kill this guy or to help out there is

240
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,850
should I have killed you Jimmy Brooks

241
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,380
shooting and fighting have both been

242
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,440
radically improved which let's be honest

243
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,940
with you shooting and fighting needed to

244
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,530
be radically improved not just over Red

245
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,600
Dead but also ever Grand Theft Auto

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,070
there's a lot of room for improvement

247
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,630
hopefully Rockstar spent a lot of time

248
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,550
to make the mechanics of the game better

249
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,410
than they have previously been that

250
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,530
would be very exciting for engaging at

251
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,080
all times each weapon yeah that fits

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,190
funny looks pretty good

253
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,710
with realistic reload and recoil so look

254
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,020
at some of these animations for shooting

255
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,640
someone were kind of boring someone

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,950
pretty exciting in a similar way the

257
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,840
bond with your horse is crucial and

258
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,520
changes based on your treatment of the

259
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,260
animal that reminds me of breath of the

260
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,730
wild obviously by the way just a little

261
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,840
tiny bit where you're collecting a

262
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,520
horse's and training horses but if it

263
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
goes deeper here that's a really cool

264
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,790
system because horses are super

265
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,200
important you don't have cars in this

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,390
game horses are as important as cars and

267
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,550
horses or living animals so you got to

268
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,170
please them and keep them happy I can

269
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,370
only imagine how frustrating it will be

270
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,470
to have a very happy healthy horse with

271
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,390
good stats who gets shot at some point

272
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,060
and you lose them but who knows there

273
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,560
might be some respawn system or a horse

274
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,420
doctor or veterinarian but really I

275
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,800
think there's a really smart way to do

276
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,710
it some breeds are better suited for

277
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:05,160
certain tasks your saddle and saddlebags

278
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,060
can store extra weapons

279
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,310
along with supplies and animal carcasses

280
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,170
that you pick up while out roaming or

281
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,820
hunting okay before we talk about

282
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,350
hunting here let me just go ahead and

283
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,300
say that you will have to buy bigger

284
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,000
stables in Red Dead Auto online and

285
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,040
there's eventually going to be really

286
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,950
crazy horses like Tron horses and

287
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,770
speeder bike horses and helicopter

288
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,100
horses and tank horses that's my that's

289
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,990
my prediction so I'm gonna be able to

290
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,970
ient stable instead of a giant garage in

291
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:45,670
red a national on online we'll see look

292
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,900
at these animations right here when he's

293
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,580
knocking people off the horses gorgeous

294
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,000
it's so gorgeous I can't wait to go that

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
movie world beautiful of predators

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,980
crocodiles and scavengers bears versus

297
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,700
wolves hunting helps the camp or earns

298
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,860
you money wounded animal and you'll have

299
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,050
to track them down I mean that's a very

300
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,880
far cry primal II to me can be traded

301
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,150
for cash to use at general stores

302
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,670
gunsmiths saloons and elsewhere this is

303
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,240
God's own country and I feel I'm in

304
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,390
purgatory this is a world that is rich

305
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,130
in depth and details

306
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,440
seriously look at the detail on all of

307
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,210
this whether it's the animals the

308
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,660
background the lighting oh my god as you

309
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,550
lived a fateful journey of a gang of

310
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,170
Outlaws on the runner

311
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,030
not

312
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,890
in the next gameplay video we'll look at

313
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,630
missions activities enemy gangs

314
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,640
robberies other things to do and much

315
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,180
more

316
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,330
including the evolution of sharpshooting

317
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,100
using look at this sharpshooting system

318
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,330
look at the Dead Eye system it's so

319
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,550
incredible this is so incredible

320
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,710
ok I can't wait to mess with that it's

321
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,840
um I love special powers in these types

322
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,580
of games so overall is this the game I

323
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,690
was hoping it would be

324
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,610
it really looks pretty close I'm ever

325
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,930
gonna get to see a lot more it's only a

326
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,750
couple months till release so I'm kind

327
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,400
of worried that we haven't seen very

328
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,720
much of the game but what we're seeing

329
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,950
now is pretty incredible we still know

330
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,660
