00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,260

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:16,230
[Music]

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,940
will be a baby

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:45,800
[Music]

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,950
who is this cute little lesbian and how

6
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,890

7
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,050
everybody receding hairline here I'm

8
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,820
sure you guys went and saw the leafy

9
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,770
responsibilities already where he

10
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,930
systematically dismantled each and every

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:11,280
one of my arguments fucking hell

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,170
the first thing I'd like to address is

13
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,119
how frequently leafy's playing the

14
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,550
victim card I mean it's really hard to

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,860
believe from someone like leafy that's

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,810
what he criticized keemstar for doing

17
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,399
and of course there's gonna be a lot of

18
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,590
dislikes this week as well this video is

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,520
gonna get spammed with dislikes oh

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,530
please show me support guys thank you

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,509
for all the support recently shut the

22
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,050
fuck up

23
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,479
by the way leafy why did you ban me from

24
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,430
commenting on your video I was just

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,350
gonna say something supportive like it

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,300
doesn't matter if you don't have a chin

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,810
leafy we still love you but then I tried

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,490
to use my alternate account to see if I

29
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,130
can post anything and I can but I can't

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,590
use words like chin or idubbbz in the

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:01,770
comment oh you were very personally

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,600
insulted by the video but that was kind

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,399
of the fucking point I'm not here to

34
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,080
shut down your channel believe it or not

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,090
I got a youtuber that I roasted in the

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,030
past 20 me on Twitter flirting with me

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,910
holy God there's so much drama that you

38
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,069
have to deal with leafy I feel so bad

39
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,020
for you dude there's someone flirting

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,190
with you man

41
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,020
that's some serious drama dude

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,300
fouseytube literally tweeting at me

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,040
saying he wants to actually fight me

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,270
make sure you get back on that

45
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,190
fouseytube drama as soon as possible

46
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,959
Calvin cuz that's that's the more

47
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,459
important drama for you to take care of

48
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,530
right now I found this on Twitter a few

49
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,480
days ago and it's so true that it's

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,209
scary first Calvin starts by bullying

51
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,099
someone this motherfucker right here

52
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,470
rapes people with that hat on Dan causes

53
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,080
some YouTube drama fucking 30 years old

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,819
we got a 30 year old man his shitty

55
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,780
behavior backfires

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,400
perfect and then what does he do he

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,650
plays victim this is all at the same

58
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,720
time of getting non-stop comments like

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,940
this of course this pussy is ignoring

60
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,040
the drama a good portion of leafy's

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,050
response was addressing the whole chin

62
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,700
thing I thought that was just a funny

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,739
meme in my video to be honest but he

64
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,940
seemed to think it was an important

65
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,370
point in the video so he spent a good

66
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,080
amount of time defending himself

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,880
well me and all these other people are

68
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,160
insecure about ourselves and have to

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,879
hide our chin our face our ears that was

70
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,160
a very weak and drawn-out segment and

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,950
you pretty much just told me yes I am

72
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,440
actually very ashamed of my weak chin

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,380
hey Calvin I watched your response video

74
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,450
and it seems like you're still quite a

75
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,069
bit bent out of shape about the whole no

76
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,470
chin thing it's probably my fault I

77
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,519
don't think I gave you enough options

78
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,230
the first time around so here's another

79
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,930
option should get a bit of clay and mold

80
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,480
yourself new chin this look right here

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,180
I'm calling goats winter I think you're

82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,560
really gonna like this next one Calvin

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,430
this one is called ladies night huh how

84
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,420
about that bro

85
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,799
you probably pleasure a couple of

86
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,600
pussies but that ever since the day that

87
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,209
mr. savage himself went from making

88
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:08,230
videos like fucking this ah

89
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,810
Slenderman Gangnam style excellent

90
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,359
choice Turner leafy you got baited I

91
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,920
actually played that video in all my

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,450
other videos because I actually liked it

93
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,669
a lot cringy Slenderman Gangnam style

94
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,070
video you like Slenderman Gangnam style

95
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,960
dude this is the part of the video where

96
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
I have to do leafies job for him because

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
he's so incompetent you see he went for

98
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,139
Slenderman Gangnam style because I

99
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,330
either he doesn't want to do research at

100
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,010
all or he was on a time crunch

101
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,780
well you didn't need a shit out of video

102
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,460
you could have done research and you

103
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,590
could have looked for the cyber matrix

104
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,180
series that would have been much more

105
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,220
hard-hitting in a video than playing

106
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,470
Slenderman Gangnam style another thing

107
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,820
that you harped on was the transition

108
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,400
slides for having a music clip

109
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,760
transition for three four eight seconds

110
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,979
too long and you've now shortened your

111
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,630
transitions and they're going to stay

112
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,580
short or they're going to disappear

113
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,610
entirely

114
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,900
yeah you're not going to bring back the

115
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,969
10-second slides and if you do that

116
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,710
sucks for you because your video is now

117
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,159
shittier 348 seconds too long what does

118
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,050
this guy have fucking AIDS or some shit

119
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,029
what the I like that but what does he

120
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,319
have AIDS or some shit

121
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,180
that's a good part that's impactful

122
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,400
that's the bombastic language I was

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,439
talking about in the previous episode by

124
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,389
making a joke about someone else's age

125
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,219
I'm obviously trying to make their

126
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,620
opinion invalid as well this next part

127
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,870
you very clumsily try to explain why I'm

128
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,149
a hypocrite because every time you

129
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,550
brought up someone's age you're just

130
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,089
saying it as a joke at 26 year old man I

131
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,309
got comedy the first time mentioning his

132
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,469
age the first time I got get a dude

133
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,229
fucking hilarious 26 year old man second

134
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,029
time I'll give you a pass like this is a

135
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,439
26 year old man you're a 26 year old

136
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,409
fucking him in that old third fourth and

137
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,330
fifth time you're starting to become a

138
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,460
fucking moron like the actual people

139
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,839
you're trying to make fun of your

140
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,819
parroting yourself you do realize that

141
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,740
for anyone who thought leafy was

142
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,629
self-deprecating by mentioning things I

143
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,520
could have roasted him about that was

144
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,740
his way of trying to protect himself but

145
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,300
in the end it just looks retarded

146
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,669
where's the obnoxious as title mentions

147
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,620
of course you want me to roast you about

148
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,389
something that everyone's roasted you

149
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,520
about that would be the perfect topic

150
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,289
for my video where's the cyber bullying

151
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,469

152

minutes of it where's the emo fucking

154
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,139
hair I bet you would have liked if I

155
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,749
took the keemstar strategy and roasted

156
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:31,610

157

161
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,159

162
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,509
like you didn't watch the video I

163
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,430
definitely compared you to some cartoon

164
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,319
characters dude but they weren't

165
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,870
attractive ones they were very ugly ones

166
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,610
without chins that's probably why you're

167
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,709
not mentioning those once you've sort of

168
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,809
selectively removed that from your head

169
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,879
but since you seem to be such a big fan

170
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,069
of the animations I'll play an animation

171
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,289
right now from a fellow named Renkin I

172
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,449
have this scene where he's in an

173
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,789
ice-cream shop and he's got a big stack

174
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,129
of ice cream covering his chin and he's

175
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,229
saying some mean shit to people no one

176
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:09,770
fucking

177
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,720
you fucking kill yourself pussy have a

178
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,759
nice day you stupid fucking cunt I'm

179
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,190
killing the next scene he's making fun

180
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,720
of more people but this time he's got a

181
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,120
basketball and from his fucked chin but

182
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,159
yes since you wanted me to compare you

183
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,800
to anime as if that's the best roast in

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,310
the book

185
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,470
you look like an anime character hey

186
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,810
leafy you look like a hentai babe

187
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,550
that'll pretty much do it for this video

188
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,379
though I do have a couple of closing

189
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,860
insults stop tweeting out pictures of

190
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,569
Sony Vegas like it's something

191
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,370
impressive saying shit like this has

192
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,740
pretty much been my life for the past 72

193
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,319
hours or so no one gives a shit I know

194
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,599
the impressionable fanbase thinks that

195
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,090
that equates to a lot of work it's just

196
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,370
fucking dogshit editing like everyone

197
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,110
else does on this fucking website I

198
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,050
don't have to edit videos anymore or at

199
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,819
least not that much I don't have to sit

200
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:05,010
there and find videos either

201
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:26,490
