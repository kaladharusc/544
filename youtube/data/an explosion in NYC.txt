1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,340
in flipping through every news channel on TV it kinda feels like he's always

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,320
made to feel like this city is a war zone right now but to be here to

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
actually be on the ground in the city

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,470
just kind of feels like another monday in September if anything it's a little

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,820
quiet here this is not like one of my normal youtube video uploads today I

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,160
want to use this channel instead as a platform to share with you a little bit

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,270
of what

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,340
normal life of what my life is like in new york city today that was kind of an

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,080
extraordinarily tumultuous time in new york city saturday morning two days ago

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,000
a pipe bomb exploded in Seaside Heights New Jersey not too far from here along

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,739
the route of like a running race

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,170
nobody was injured the right now the main focus is to make the area safe read

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,699
later that night a homemade bomb exploded in a dumpster on $MONTH

14
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,400

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,880
trying to disarm it

22

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,479

00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:11,970
no no noticeable extra police protection or soldiers or anything extreme like

29
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:23,190
that just da just business as usual have the recent events

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,739

this is the site of the explosion on Saturday night even here these are quiet

34
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,550
there are news crews and pop and FBI agents a lot of a lot of public safety

35
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:55,470
officers of the side back smoothly

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,730
something

37
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,780
now that's gonna be a lot like our chemistry like I did with the food too

38
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,550
except like

39
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:24,990
even here in Times Square feels quiet and what pd tacticals here there's an

40
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,460
extra copy but for the most part a lot of people look like about a child

41
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,760
soaking up the city

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:41,870
yeah

43
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,580
this is actually my first time here so I'm nervous

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,610
anyway and it just it made me

45
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,870
before nervous about

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
it doesn't affect the way like you go about your life

47
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,340

no one's having issues over here

54
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,899
do you think that there's like a difference at all with the way people

55
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,799
are conducted themselves in the city with the recent events it's business as

56
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:02,989
usual everyone's just going about their business not worry darling what do you

57
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:07,189
think what do you think that says about New Yorkers that were resilient we've

58
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,869
been through before sure we'll be through again and we'll just keep buying

59
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,920
your back

60
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:22,620
I moved to New York City three months before the terrorist attack of sep

61
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,990
tember 11 2001 i lived a block beneath the world trade center's I've never once

62
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,750
been surprised at the resiliency or the attitude of New Yorkers towards what

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,920
would be towards the tents towards the scary towards the kind of events have

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,750
been happening in the last couple of days the ethos in the atmosphere that is

65
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,790
perpetuated about what New York and what New Yorkers are is true this is a city

66
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,050
of eight million that copse and deals with whatever it is confronted with

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
