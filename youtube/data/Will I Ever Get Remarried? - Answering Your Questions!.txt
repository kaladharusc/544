1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,310
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,929
YouTube's boogie2988 commercial I was

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:05,520
again through the power of the Internet

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,540
I haven't done one of these in a few

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,890
months but I thought it now would be a

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,110
good time ask people on the community

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,480
tab on Twitter and elsewhere to ask me

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,710
questions and I just thought I would

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,570
answer some of your questions today so

10
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,460
sit back and relax and let's let's see

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,500
what people want to know Infowars one of

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,420
the Infowars didn't you get banned from

13
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,180
YouTube wasn't it a big deal infowar is

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,070
one of the no why don't you make more

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,900
Francis videos cuz I don't wanna get

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,269
banned like Infowars the original reason

17
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,769
I stopped doing Francis sketches and

18
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,110
videos is because my ex-wife and I got a

19
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,610
divorce and she was helping me write

20
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,649
those characters sketches she was help

21
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,239
me film them and she has helped me to do

22
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,520
the cleanup she was in a lot of ways the

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,100
heart and the soul of the character so I

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,320
when she was gone Francis kind of left

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
with her but a few months after the

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
divorce of the muse bit me again and I

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,510
made this Francis sketch called Francis

28
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,610
gets abandoned by his sister and it kind

29
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,770
of and her rebooted the character and

30
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,899
like recreated him for me if you haven't

31
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,010
seen this video I really hope you do

32
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,149
I'll probably link to it down in the

33
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,890
description box but unfortunately

34
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,780
Francis turned out to kind of be poison

35
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,630
in this whole new YouTube algorithm for

36
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,430
whatever reason all my Francis videos

37
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,990
got to monetize like eighty ninety

38
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,549
percent of men more getting to monetized

39
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,380
every single day YouTube will not rest

40
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,930
until they do monetize all of it

41
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,240
gee great Thank You Tube but screw the

42
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,860
algorithm and screw you too and screw

43
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,720
money every Friday now I'm uploading a

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,820
Francis sketch or a Francis video or a

45
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,290
Francis rage or something related to

46
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,329
Francis you can expect to see that every

47
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,450
Friday moving forward from here on out

48
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,439
just not during the rest of the week

49
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,640
because I got to do something to pay the

50
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,060
mortgage

51
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,380
Cuban coffee wants to know would you

52
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,479
ever tell the full story of your father

53
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,340
and his death on YouTube like you did on

54
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,320
Twitch so as you know there's a bunch of

55
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,180
stories that I've never told on YouTube

56
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,250
that I probably should in a story time

57
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,630
series including the death of my father

58
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,270
in his life and all of that stuff it

59
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,470
will probably eventually make it to

60
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,670
youtube but right now I'm trying to

61
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,890
concentrate on more positive content

62
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,840
more happy content because for the last

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,240
year I've been so negative but now that

64
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm coming out of that font now that I'm

65
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,880
coming out of like recovery from the

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
divorce and everything else and I'm

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,790
feeling good and I've lost all this

68
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,680
weight I want to put positive stuff out

69
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,940
into the world instead of negative stuff

70
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,739
for a change so hope you can bear with

71
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,849
me but those stories they'll eventually

72
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,920
come out the anomaly from

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,480
edan wants to know what do you think of

74
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,180
the state of YouTube overall it's it's

75
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,330
it's fine everything's fine don't don't

76
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,220
worry but everything's going great where

77
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,680
it's it's it's ok that's fine

78
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,020
YouTube for me personally is not in a

79
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,550
good state I feel like I didn't put out

80
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,680
my best content in the last year I feel

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,150
like almost every video that I've ever

82
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,340
put out has been to monetized I feel

83
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,750
like I'm getting less fuse than I've

84
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,520
ever gotten in part because of both of

85
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
those different reasons and I'm

86
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,550
certainly not alone on that I think a

87
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,230
lot of my fellow creators feel exactly

88
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,760
the same way there's still plenty of

89
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,380
youtubers who are nailing it in this

90
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,880
format you know some of my favorites

91
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,769
like Casey nice dad or Philip DeFranco

92
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,019
they continue to prosper and some of the

93
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,519
people who are maybe not my favorites

94
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,830
like the Paul Brothers they continue to

95
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,510
make millions I feel like YouTube always

96
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,280
has the best of intentions when it makes

97
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,690
a decision but it almost always ends up

98
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,970
blowing up in their face all the time

99
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,230
and certainly blowing up with the face

100
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,569
of creators their decision making never

101
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,459
seems to be that smart and it never

102
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,590
seems to be pro-consumer and it doesn't

103
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,030
seem to be procreator it seems to be

104
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,519
almost always be pro corporate and pro

105
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,190
agenda and of course like my infamous

106
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,600
video about Alex Jones in which I said

107
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,549
he broke the rules so therefore he got

108
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,560
banned that is true but it still a

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,780
really worrisome trend that a lot of

110
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,700
people not just Alex Jones are

111
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,950
disappearing from the platform either or

112
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,720
in organically by getting banned

113
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,780
organically because their views just

114
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,220
disappear I will still say I love this

115
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,780
platform I love the opportunity it gave

116
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,100
me I love the paychecks I love

117
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,750
everything about communicating with you

118
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,820
here on this format though the folks who

119
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,500
run this website really need to get

120
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,790
their stuff together I really feel that

121
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,320
way sometimes here's the match of The

122
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,390
Gathering related question the GMO champ

123
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,560
wants to know are you going to do a

124
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,570
Ravnica pre-release if so which guild

125
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,340
are you doing if I was playing I would

126
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,570
play goal gari because I want that

127
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,670
Assassin's trophy but I'm not gonna be

128
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,720
able to do it because I'm going to be

129
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,940
out of town at the retro Palooza in

130
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,010
Arlington Texas so if you live in Texas

131
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,630
if you're near Dallas you want to come

132
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,880
meet me I will be there all weekend

133
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,010
shaking hands and signing pictures and

134
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,660
taking pictures and signing stuff so

135
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,069
just show up and I would love to see you

136
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,540
guys I would much rather meet you guys

137
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,670
than to play magic I really would do

138
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,709
biryu asks how have you dealt with

139
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,000
anxiety in the past I'm going through

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,380
some serious stuff right now and need

141
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,060
some advice are you sure you want to ask

142
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,650
me that question because anxiety and

143
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,630
depression is why I ate myself to 600

144
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,130
pounds I did not handle it well

145
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,840
I guess I handle it good now but I did

146
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,460
not handle it well at first first piece

147
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,440
of advice do not try to eat yourself to

148
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,170
death it does not work second piece of

149
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,200
advice is therapy medication these are

150
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
really really good tools if you're not

151
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,890
going through therapy if you don't have

152
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,660
the right medications offered to you by

153
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,000
that therapist then you probably need to

154
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,830
look at that stuff I mean that really is

155
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,050
the way to go if you had a broken arm

156
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,370
you would go to the emergency room if

157
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,230
you've got a broken brain you should you

158
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,880
should see a therapist the basic advice

159
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
though that I learned through therapy is

160
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,570
distraction techniques you know learning

161
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,310
to focus on things that are not the

162
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,540
thing that are making you anxious by

163
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,160
like playing some video games reading a

164
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,690
book getting some exercise walking the

165
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,920
dog something like that

166
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,500
the second tenet is to do no permanent

167
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,030
damage when you're anxious just don't

168
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,650
make any important decisions when you're

169
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,360
anxious don't get frustrated don't break

170
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,160
anything don't cry don't say anything

171
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
mean or bad or scary to somebody else

172
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,780
just just be calm distract yourself and

173
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,160
get away from the whatever's making you

174
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,810
anxious and just don't do any permanent

175
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,460
damage and that's an immediate solution

176
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,130
but the long-term solution is therapy

177
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,050
vai Coburn wants to know what character

178
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,340

Francis series sorry about that Connor

192
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,980
Ellis wants to know when creating videos

193
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,450
do you still have the same ideas

194
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,160
excitement and motivation from when you

195
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,390
first started on YouTube

196
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,770
am I still excited to make youtube

197
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,080
videos every day yes I still love this

198
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,030
job but we all get burnout from time to

199
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,190
time am i excited to make the same

200
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,140
content over and over again no and

201
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,120
that's why I'm always changing up always

202
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,830
doing different stuff even with Francis

203
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,780
trying to do completely different things

204
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,640
with the character if you take a look at

205
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,460
some of my old content it's it's very

206
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,510
dear here take a look at my show you

207
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,870
want to talk about

208
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,730
when I came up with the idea to put

209
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,470
pudding in a mayonnaise jar and pretend

210
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,240
I was eating pudding and make a mess out

211
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,830
of myself I thought I was creating

212
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,270
YouTube gold I was super excited to make

213
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,770
that video I would not make that video

214
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,350
again today but I'm excited to make this

215
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,449
one so change it up man that's the

216
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,669
that's the key just just keep growing as

217
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,530
a creator or it like for me in the last

218
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,750
year's screwing it up as a creator but

219
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,870
still Tim guy Solara says what is the

220
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,430
hardest part about being YouTube famous

221
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,810
I know it's kind of a weird question but

222
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,100
are there any downsides are you

223
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,050
considered completely a good thing to be

224
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,510
YouTube famous so there's a ton of good

225
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,310
stuff obviously there's a nice paycheck

226
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,900
involved and you're getting to do what

227
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,729
you love you don't have to deal with

228
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,740
other bosses or anything like that clock

229
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,600
in from 9:00 to 5:00 every day there's

230
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,070
plenty of great stuff about this job I

231
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,889
love this job it's mostly very very good

232
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,419
there are a few frustrating things about

233
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,840
being a public figure you know people

234
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,160
theorizing and critiquing you on the

235
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,750
internet it's very difficult to handle

236
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,100
sometimes you know and then you have a

237
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,740
few crazy people like haters or people

238
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,360
who like send you nasty stuff and you're

239
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,130
peel boxes are you deal with like death

240
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,330
threats or you deal with people showing

241
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,550
up at your front door unannounced stuff

242
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,830
like that so there's devil there's

243
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,450
definitely some downsides there I think

244
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,860
a downside people don't really talk

245
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,240
about that's been bothering me a lot

246
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
lately is there's so many people who

247
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,690
want to reach out to you so many people

248
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,580
that want to talk to you so many people

249
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,560
that need your help and there's only one

250
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,810
me so there's only so many letters I can

251
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,669
read in a day so many emails that I can

252
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,560
read so many things that I can retweet

253
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,330
there's only so many people I can

254
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,889
interact with and it's almost like

255
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,720
there's an infinite number of people out

256
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,310
there who want my attention who need my

257
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,320
help it's really frustrating because I

258
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,789
wish I could do more there's just

259
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,169
there's just not enough time in the day

260
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,300
to do everything I want to do for

261
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,430
everyone that needs it it kind of sucks

262
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,200
and I know bigger youtubers like Casey

263
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,300
nice dad I know for a fact they deal

264
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,650
with that stuff I can't imagine the

265
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,780
guilt that they feel Calum Shingleton

266
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,599
Smith great name asks hey boogie do you

267
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,220
want another marriage or another

268
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,289
long-term relationship so I guess the

269
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,419
short answer to that is yes but not

270
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,370
right now because getting a divorce and

271
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,900
going through all of that did break me

272
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,080
pretty badly but not completely so I

273
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,669
haven't given up I'm definitely not

274
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,349
ready to get married again right now

275
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,020
though I do well ideally what I would

276
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,640
like to find is I'd like to meet a nice

277
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,169
young lady that has a lot in common and

278
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:43,840
just

279
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,250
out with them and just go to movies and

280
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,620
just do stuff and do like that you know

281
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,050
that entry level dating stuff for a

282
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,490
really good long time because I'm still

283
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,710
recovering I still got a stuff to do do

284
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,050
I think I'm gonna find that person she'd

285
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,520
be one of the millions of probably not

286
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,050
so I'm concentrating on my health I'm

287
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,070
concentrating my job and I'm

288
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,390
concentrating on my mental health right

289
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,040
now let's see if we get lucky though

290
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,660
Michael says do you think you would

291
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,480
still be here without YouTube here on

292
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,610
your screen right now

293
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,620
no because how else would I get here man

294
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,150
come on put your put your brain together

295
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,130
yeah you think about it do I think I'd

296
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,960
be where I am today without YouTube I

297
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,130
certainly wouldn't have lost the weight

298
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,830
I might even be dead to be entirely

299
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,820
honest with you because when I started

300
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,380
my youtube career I had given up on life

301
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,930
I was on disability I was happy just

302
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,850
dying on disability never putting my

303
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,320
stuff together never getting my life

304
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,050
together just wasting away and I'm

305
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,640
fairly certain I would have wasted away

306
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,410
by now but YouTube gave me an

307
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,880
opportunity to reinvent everything and

308
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,740
recreate everything and with a little

309
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,390
bit of hard work and a whole bunch of

310
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,480
luck and thanks to you guys I'm here and

311
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm really happy to be here this

312
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,240
certainly beats where I was back in

313
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,030
2006-2007 on disability miserable and

314
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,060
alone thank you guys for that and that's

315
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,530
it that's ten of your questions I'm

316
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,730
gonna wrap this video up so I can get it

317
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,770
out right after I posted those questions

318
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,760
so you guys can see the video

319
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,100
immediately I do have a sponsor shout

320
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,300
out though real quick if you're willing

321
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,740
to bear with me I mentioned therapy a

322
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,300
few times in this video and it's no

323
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,920
coincidence because today's sponsors the

324
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,840
folks over it better help and if you've

325
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,800
noticed that I've been doing a lot

326
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,030
better over the last couple of months

327
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,460
it's because I got back into therapy and

328
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,560
I started right there with better help

329
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,330
and I recommend if you need therapy it's

330
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,040
a good place to get started look if

331
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,570
you're in a state of severe crisis

332
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,130
better help is not for you you need to

333
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,750
reach out to the right people and I'll

334
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,100
link resources down to the description

335
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,380
box but a few months back I signed up

336
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,270
for better help it was very easy to do I

337
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,000
just did it via my phone and I started

338
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,860
talking with a therapist there and after

339
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,180
a couple of months of talking to that

340
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,760
therapist almost every day I realized

341
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,320
that I needed much more intensive

342
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,490
therapy than they were able to provide

343
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,770
they recommended I get medication they

344
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,330
recommended I talked to my doctor and

345
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,130
they recommended I got into seeing a

346
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,080
regular therapist and now I'm using both

347
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,850
a regular therapist who I see once a

348
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,890
week and the folks over at better help

349
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,360

350
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,220
