hello everyone I am Walter Binet dziak

I'm Heather roofs and I'm Anna Wade and

8
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,010
this is top five most of us love Indiana

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,040
Jones across four great movies there are

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,780
tons of amazing moments in this

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,410
franchise

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,260
well three great movies the Indiana

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,180
Jones character and films are beyond

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,670
legendary at this point starting in 1981

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,620
with Raiders of the Lost Ark Indy and

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,059
the creators behind him like George

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,100
Lucas and Steven Spielberg have given us

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,280
one of if not the most iconic

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,540
action-adventure series in cinematic

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,110
history

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,970
with a proposed fifth film still in

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,979
development Indies greatest days are

23
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,170
most likely behind him but that doesn't

24
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,729
mean we can't celebrate his greatest

25
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,130
feats on screen anytime we want there

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,990
are scenes and sequences that will

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,420
always be close to our hearts and today

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,450
we cover the best of them these are the

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,610
top 5 best Indiana Jones movie moments

30
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:40,360
number 5

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,280
not only is it movie trivia worthy but

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,410
also my personal favorite moment of the

33
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,540
series in Raiders of the Lost Ark

34
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,490
Indiana Jones is being chased through a

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,680
market with Marion when she is abducted

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,200
by Nazis he's cornered by one of the bad

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,479
guys and in perhaps the most baller

38
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,300
Indiana Jones move he takes care of the

39
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,850
baddie in the most logical way shooting

40
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,030
him eliminating any need for a showdown

41
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,590
for those who don't know this iconic

42
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,840
scene has an interesting backstory the

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,520
original scene was supposed to be an

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,040
extended combat sequence of sword versus

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,110
whip it was going to take a few days to

46
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,630
shoot unfortunately Harrison Ford had

47
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,300
intestinal distress on location and was

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,980
constantly returning to his trailer

49
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,380
making longer sequences difficult to

50
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,510
shoot Harrison remarked that it would

51
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,920
make more sense to just shoot the

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,110
swordsman and that's exactly what he did

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,780
yes the stunt guy learned an entire

54
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,640
sequence just to have it cut at a

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,100
moment's notice this moment was so

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,290
classic indeed that I had a callback in

57
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,660
the sequel Temple of Doom Indiana Jones

58
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,620
reaches for his gun

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,590
finds an empty holster and must finally

60
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:59,330
fight the swordsman gunless number 4

61
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't think the sequence is talked

62
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,660
about quite as much as it used to be

63
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,730
which is a shame because it's incredible

64
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,890
in Temple of Doom Indy Willie and

65
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,750
shortround are on the run and trying to

66
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,430
escape the temple by jumping into a

67
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,620
minecart they're quickly followed and an

68
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,630
epic chase ensues through the monstrous

69
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,120
caverns unstable tracks and high speeds

70
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,850
make for one bumpy ride this isn't

71
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,800
really just one moment the whole scene

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,230
needs to be praised and appreciated it's

73
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,970
one of the best pure effects sequences

74
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,760
I've ever seen and it more than holds up

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,340
now the expert use of miniatures mixed

76
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,480
with the full-size sets

77
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,030
flowed together perfectly even the water

78
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,410
rushing through at the end looks

79
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,420
realistic since that was shot with the

80
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,100
miniatures to avoid seeing the water

81
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,990
droplets the effects team used air

82
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,580
cannons to keep the water looking as

83
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,370
unwieldy and wild as possible this is a

84
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,320
true cinematic achievement and while I

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,030
don't think it's talked about as much as

86
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,890
say the trench run in the original Star

87
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,500
Wars it's absolutely on that same level

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,959
now there is some early blue screen use

89
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,640
that doesn't look great upon close

90
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,470
inspection but if you're into the movie

91
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,570
that's barely noticeable quite simply

92
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,890
they don't make them like this anymore

93
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,440
nowadays this would be any throw away

94
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,239
heavily computer animated sequence and

95
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,860
there would be nothing unique about it

96
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,720
at all what makes it stand out is the

97
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,570
craftsmanship and by hand hard work put

98
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,519
in to make it look as realistic as

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,410
possible I've never seen it up on the

100
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,940
big screen but this would probably be

101
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,520
ten times better in a theater however I

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,110
have written the Indiana Jones ride at

103
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,850
Disneyland and it's one of my favorite

104
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,410
the park close enough I guess I

105
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,940
encourage you to look up some

106
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,350
behind-the-scenes videos about the

107
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,360
making of Temple of Doom and this scene

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,610
in particular it's fascinating to listen

109
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,200
to the effects team talked about how

110
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,830
this sequence was done number three

111
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,350
[Music]

112
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:57,840
[Music]

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
few images and scenes are more

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,919
iconically Indiana Jones than switching

115
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,720
an idol out for a bag of sand and being

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,639
chased by a giant boulder this was a

117
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,229
part of the opening scene of Raiders of

118
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,510
the Lost Ark the opening sequence as a

119
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,160
whole is arguably one of the best

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,620
openings to a movie it is the perfect

121
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,510
introduction to the character and the

122
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,919
world of Indiana Jones

123
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,780
we are dropped into the climax of a

124
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,090
typical Indiana Jones caper as Indy

125
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,830
begins to explore the temple the

126
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,750
audience is able to see the skill and

127
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,250
knowledge with which he conducts himself

128
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,080
to eventually get to the idol in the

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,940
final room of the temple he then

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,919
attempts to disarm the final trap using

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,570
a bag of sand that he collected at the

132
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,880
entrance of the temple the first time I

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,190
saw this scene I remember holding my

134
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,290
breath as Indy switches the idol with

135
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,020
the sand for a moment we think that he's

136
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,840
done it then the trap is triggered and

137
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,820
the temple begins to fall apart the

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,590
music picks up the editing becomes more

139
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,840
frantic our hero is put in life-or-death

140
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,539
situations here we see that India is

141
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,699
also resourceful and can make up a great

142
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,949
plan on the fly the final element of

143
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,930
this chase is a giant boulder that

144
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,030
indeed narrowly avoids as he jumps out

145
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,250
of the temple so many elements came

146
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,070
together to make the scene wonderful the

147
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,780
music the shots the editing the

148
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,460
practical effects character moments

149
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,560
people have been trying to imitate it

150
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,720
for decades and continue to reference it

151
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:32,680
even in current pop culture number two

152
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,990
this moment might make you lose your

153
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,620
head but don't have a meltdown

154
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,759
the whole of the first movie had been

155
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,770
building to this moment the Ark of the

156
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,690
Covenant had been found but it was in

157
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,940
Nazi hands fearful that the Ark was a

158
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,039
fake the team of Nazis and archeologists

159
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,449
perform a ritual to open it before

160
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,729
taking it back to Germany during all of

161
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,560
this Indiana Jones and Marion have been

162
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,930
captured they actually play a very small

163
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,490
role in this scene and have their eyes

164
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,410
closed throughout to avoid the awesome

165
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,690
power of the ark the ark is opened and

166
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,060
lightning strikes out at the Nazis they

167
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,889
are then surrounded by an ethereal light

168
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:09,940
that turns deadly

169
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,699
leading to an infamous death scene totes

170
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,150
face literally melts off like there is

171
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,550
so much power or radiation or whatever

172
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,590
coming out of the Ark it causes his skin

173
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,259
to liquidate and stream off of his skull

174
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,650
besides being amazingly gruesome it was

175
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,960
the perfect payoff to the build-up of

176
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,509
opening the ark the effects look great

177
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,490
and do a wonderful job portraying the

178
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,770
action the effect was created by first

179
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,900
taking a face cast of the actor the

180
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,610
artist then built a skull made of stone

181
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,130
and layered gelatin with other bits like

182
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,620
yarn to create the melting face the

183
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,840
final result took many attempts before

184
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,150
the perfect formula was found it was an

185
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,310
innovative and amazing practical effect

186
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,139
one of the things that takes it to the

187
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,090
next level though is the gurgling noise

188
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:02,229
at the end so creepy but so amazing to

189
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,419
many dimension almost every major moment

190
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:05,770
from the first three films could fit

191
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,599
here so if you want to see some more

192
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,729
best moments from the series go ahead

193
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,680
and rewatch rate at the last arc Temple

194
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,490
of Doom and the Last Crusade it's time

195
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,460
for more adventures with Indiana Jim

[Music]

197
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:39,710
[Music]

198
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,650
and the number one best Indiana Jones

199
00:08:43,650 --> 00:09:00,090
movie moment if you chose boy to me

200
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,940
this scene defines Indiana Jones our

201
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,280
hero has reached the Holy Grail literal

202
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,140
but Walter Donovan and Elsa Schneider

203
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,420
are there to ruin the party among many

204
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,970
false Grails the true cup of Christ sits

205
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,220
but Elsa purposely gives Donovan the

206
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,720
wrong one killing it

207
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,120
now Indy has to find the real Grail to

208
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,760
save his dying father it's everything I

209
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,620
love about these movies all in one

210
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,660
sequence the stakes are high with Henry

211
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,160
Jones senior bleeding to death from

212
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
Donovan's gunshot and II just made it

213
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,970
past the trials and booby traps we get

214
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,740
another twist on the face melting scene

215
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,960
and of course we get one of my favorite

216
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,300
characters in this whole series the

217
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,230
Grail Knight

218
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,000
the Grail cannot possibly on the great

219
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,889
that's the bundle price of immortality

220
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,360
the presentation of this character was

221
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,610
fantastic and I think Robert Edison did

222
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,769
an amazing job in the role it almost

223
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,510
makes me want an animated spin-off

224
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,010
series like they used to do back in the

225
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,899
day the misadventures of the Grail night

226
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,579
featuring Indiana Jones it could be

227
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,500
about the night integrating into 1930

228
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,449
society I would have watched the crap

229
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,120
out of that and that wave it's the best

230
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,310
in cinematic history his line delivery

231
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,070
is also legendary you who have chosen

232
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,750
Indy finding the true Grail and saving

233
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,459
his dad was great as well actually

234
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,470
anything with Indy and his dad was great

235
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,370
Indiana Indiana

let it come

238
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,620
I love this scene so much I love the

239
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,340
Last Crusade

240
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,370
I love Indiana Jones it was mostly a lot

241
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,110
of fun rewatching these films they're

242
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,090
like nothing else except the serials

243
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,680
they were based on I guess but they will

244
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,750
always be a gold standard when it comes

245
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,400
to adventure movies and one bad

246
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,980

249
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,130
would have played out if big events in

250
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,050
film history took a different turn in

251
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,270
our first episode we asked what if

252
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,920
Apollo Creed survived his fight with

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,950
