1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,629
okay while we do the trailer in review

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,190
our impressions for bumblebee we thought

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,980
they we'd give you our impressions on

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,179
the joaquin phoenix joker okay this one

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,179
kind of came out of nowhere right and we

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,630
have a actual makeup test here going on

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,529
for you so we're gonna give you our

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,779
first reactions to that and give you

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,869
what we think of the actual movie and

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,570
and joaquin alright here we go ready

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,830
let's check it out

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:42,730
[Music]

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,330
okay short and sweet and actually if you

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,670
get so when I first reacted to this I

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,070
was like what there's no way that this

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,890
is you know his final makeup he looks

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,320
like a clown no pun intended I mean joke

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,970
but no he looks like a traditional

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,150
birthday party type of clown right at

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,450
but I don't know and if you look at

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,320
Joaquin okay he has this aura about him

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,110
right we know he's a great actor we know

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,810
he can pull off the park is he the guy

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,270
is a crazy guy yeah he is

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,420
and he's got this subtle creepy smile to

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,610
it this I didn't think there was another

27
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,800
angle Joker that we could take you know

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,670
what I mean we had what we had Joker and

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:45,560
as you can see the funny cartoony you

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,650
know Batman series and then we had of

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,820
course you know Heath Ledger's Joker and

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,650
then we have Jared Leto's you know

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,140
gangster Joker but I didn't consider

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,300
like a creepy clown failed birthday

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,010
party clown Joker what do you think

36
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,930
about that Joe since you don't like

37
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,310
clowns in the first clowns but his

38
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,350
backstory and the makeup that ice know

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,720
it's not really as bad well I don't know

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,610
in some comics yeah cuz the one I

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,560
remember it's like he was like trying to

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,420
be a stand-up comedian and it's

43
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,130
something like that as a failed comic

44
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:32,420
and he was just like no Nelson are you

45
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,630
just hearing the the what this film is

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,880
cuz I don't know because from what I

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,360
remember

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,489
Joker felt he was just a criminal and he

49
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,489
fell into the van oh yeah he was helping

50
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,420
people like it was a build-up I remember

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,640
that story so I gosh I didn't I guess I

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,650
don't know the backstory of Joker but

53
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,400
here

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,440
we got some more pictures over here

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,819
let's take a look at these and that kind

56
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,590
of looks like the mask Heath was wearing

57
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,950
cuz it wasn't in the classic one - does

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,750
this look like the mask Heath yeah and

59
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,970
yeah yeah it's see that that mask was

60
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,400
more making fun of traditional clowns

61
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,170
and things like that and this is more

62
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,150
like a traditional clown in fact there's

63
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,340
an action figure I think it looks almost

64
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,980
exactly like his costume here I like his

65
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,569
costume so original I thought that the

66
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,549
makeup wasn't going to be the final

67
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,470
makeup and this was just you know his

68
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,810
makeup as the fail comedian as their

69
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,970
failed you know clown and then he turns

70
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,590
into something else but as you can see

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,230
here this is his final makeup now how

72
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,230
does his hair turn green I don't know

73
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,329
does he still fall in a vat I have no

74
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,390
clue or is it more just you know going

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,730
insane and see

76
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:56,319
look why clearly is going and you've got

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,569
is he swinging that around and now yeah

78
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,940
that's Crazy's got like a joker posse of

79
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,160
people just beating the hell out of you

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,950
know I don't know it is he using gas as

81
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,139
he figured out how to mix chemicals

82
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,269
together and make everybody go crazy

83
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,930
that's cute I don't know but guys so my

84
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,539
so initially when I first heard about

85
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,729
this I was like that's just kind of odd

86
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,160
we're gonna have multiple Joker's but I

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,010
thought because Joaquin Phoenix is such

88
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,590
a good actor that I was like alright I'm

89
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,320
willing to you know see what he's got

90
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,930
and if you think about it as an

91
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,220
Elseworlds

92
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,180
story I think it's genius actually

93
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,500
because you know you could I think this

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,440
is the direction I think DC has finally

95
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,080
hit on something big here station no

96
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,139
longer what do you mean I think they are

97
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,470
Joe listen alive okay okay so if you

98
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,530
consider this in Elseworlds film and DC

99
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,830
does a bunch of Elseworlds movie movies

100
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,169
and and gives different interpretation

101
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,120
of the characters I think that's their

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,759
unique thing they gotta stop they you

103
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,650
know they tried to copy marvel and have

104
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,529
failed you know and now if they go in

105
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,080
and they do character centric films that

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,509
focuses very tightly on one character

107
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,539
sort of like the Logan thing right then

108
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,300
I think that could be DC's thing now as

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,189
I was saying it out loud I was like oh

110
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,349
man but I want to see the traditional

111
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,599
stuff I want to see it done correctly

112
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,669
like Superman done correctly because I

113
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,590
actually consider Man of Steel and

114
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,900
Elseworlds story so if people are saying

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,729
this is the first Elseworlds film no

116
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,279
it's Superman and Man of Steel is the

117
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,560
first Elseworlds story and now we can

118
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,189
dismiss all of Batman V Superman we can

119
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,379
dismiss Justice League though it was a

120
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,139
little bit better but I think I think

121
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,089
it's a genius move it looks interesting

122
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,490
there's you know footage of him out

123
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,229
there you know talking with another

124
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,999
clown you can see that there in the

125
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,240
background you know some of the subway

126
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,139
stuff so great actor character centric

127
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,120
focusing on a villain almost like venom

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,870
you know from from Sony and Marvel does

129
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,599
Batman figure in here we know that

130
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,389
actually I think it's Thomas Wayne

131
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,229
actually figures in here so Batman's

132
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,520
father or grandfather cuz I don't

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,409
remember his father running for office

134
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:34,159
and this is something Wayne yeah Thomas

135
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,439
Wayne so like I said it's an else world

136
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,330
story it has to be you know if that's

137
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,629
Batman's father shoot I don't know but

138
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:44,599
super interested so in this sense DC

139
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,970
good

140
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,160
[Music]

Manny looks creepy there boy

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,730
alright so final impressions Joe yes I

144
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,560
do want to see this movie I'm very

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,100
intrigued I applaud DC yeah finally

146
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,580

looking forward to seeing the trailer

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,720
obviously we'll do a trailer reaction

153
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,090
when that comes out but this Elseworlds

154
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,390
idea fascinating I think that's kind of

155
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,450
the direction DC should go in so I'm

156
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,910
excited with that but please please

157
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,760
don't give us more Superman films no I

158
00:07:44,760 --> 00:08:02,290
