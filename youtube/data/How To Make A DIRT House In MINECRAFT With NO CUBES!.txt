you guys enjoyed that video a lot I was

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,160
playing on the smut as you can see here

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,680
right now I'm in a flat world but if you

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,829
look at the ground it it's not really

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,190
flat its it's not exactly flat it is a

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,920
little bumpy it's actually like you know

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,199
realistic terrain kind of like realistic

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,379
Minecraft but yeah guys today we're

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,000
going to be uh playing around with it

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,250
and we're going to be building a dirt a

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,979
Minecraft e-famous minecraft dirt house

25
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,960
yes the famous minecrafter house but

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,000
using this mod so it should be actually

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,530
pretty interesting I was curious

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,810
esterday after playing this mod how that

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,720
would end up working and uh it seems

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,060
like it would work actually pretty good

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,090
or interesting it might look pretty cool

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,470
I think it's gonna look pretty cool if

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,600
you think it's gonna look pretty cool

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,009
comment down below and also if you can't

35
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,020
smack that like button if you believe in

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,560
magic cuz I do I do I'm gonna put on

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,509
peaceful for now so these the slimes

38
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,780
don't you know go in my way but uh yeah

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,790
guys like I just said in the beginning

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,960
of the video we're going to make a dirt

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,390
house but I wanted to see how a village

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,030
spawns how it looks in you know this

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,060
type of terrain I know the gravel is

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,640
part of it so the gravel match is pretty

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,360
good the houses and the stairs it

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,540
actually blends in pretty perfect if you

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,200
ask me so you know that the house is I

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,810
mean I mean that's a little bit broken

49
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,860
but it's not bad it's it's not that bad

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,590
so

51
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,690
actually this is pretty broken down here

52
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,620
if you ask me

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,220
whoa whoa I didn't mean to do that

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,780
all right let's go back out into the

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,750
open field of this flat world now we're

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,370
going to jail we're going to need is a

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,890
dirt block we're going to use dirt block

58
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,129
not grass block so now we are actually

59
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,480
going to make our forts now I don't know

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,569
particularly how I'm going to do this it

61
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,920
seems like it's did that not do anything

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,879
I know the structure of this world I

63
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,200
mean of this mod is a bit different than

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,180
what you guys would think so it might

65
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,129
take a while to actually figure this out

66
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:06,269
because I honestly don't have a clue how

67
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,069
I'm going to make this work out because

68
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,829
it just how it forms doesn't form very

69
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,730
good except like that that but that

70
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,950
looks pretty good now with this mod

71
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,139
making a dirt house it would be a lot

72
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,470
more complicating than what it looks

73
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,669
like what did i do right there

74
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,220
did I do something I think I did

75
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,590
something all right there we go okay so

76
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,620
that's how we make the wall a lot bigger

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,260
can we move it down here what about what

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,910
about down here hey wait wait wait you

79
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,239
don't want that okay okay okay I'm

80
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,799
starting to get the hang of it a little

81
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,209
bit

82
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,609
I kind of understand it but it's still

83
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,489
pretty complicated it's pretty

84
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,209
complicated

85
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,030
all right so there's there's one wall as

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,069
silly as that may look let's see let's

87
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,349
see now if we put some over here okay

88
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,510
it's so interesting how this forms I'm

89
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,599
not fully understanding how this forms

90
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,379
or what I'm even doing but whatever I'm

91
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,900
doing I'm doing I'm doing all right I

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,380
guess let's make this little this wall

93
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,639
just a tad bit taller okay

94
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,389
oh I get it so like automatically places

95
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,659
so if I put right here I don't put it in

96
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,449
random spots it'll automatically place

97
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,099
where it thinks it'll go it'll form the

98
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:42,659
best okay let's put a block right here

99
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,610
okay so this is we have two little walls

100
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,300
up okay this is this is a really

101
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,939
complicated dirt house the most

102
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,340
complicated dirt house in Minecraft if

103
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,529
you asked me yeah okay stood another

104
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,779
layer up is that forming right

105
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:09,639
hey place it place down okay okay so so

106
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,500
it's starting to curve in that that's

107
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,810
what we want we want to kind of curve in

108
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,840
wait wait wait wait right did did that

109
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,759
do anything okay okay okay so we're

110
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,939
starting to get the roof already how's

111
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,099
this looking it's looking pretty curvy

112
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,279
this is so weird to do this in Minecraft

113
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,199
you're still used people are so used to

114
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,169
blocks block game that this is just kind

115
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,330
of funky but it's actually kind of cool

116
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,389
it makes it just a little bit more

117
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,819
complicated and a little bit more neat

118
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:50,190
in my opinion this would make you know a

119
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,800
good addition to if there is a mod pack

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,500
called like the realistic mod pack okay

121
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
let's let's fill this up just a tad bit

122
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,169
because we don't want random holes in

123
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:04,210
our in our fort

124
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,089
okay this list looks sloppy this looks

125
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,509
pretty sloppy there we go that that's

126
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,129
looking pretty good that is looking

127
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,870
pretty good we're about halfway done

128
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,650
with our fork you know it's okay it

129
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,020
still looks kind of bouldering so right

130
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,300
now it's more like a shade area it's

131
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,259
more looks like a shade area okay okay

132
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,620
let's kind of start no we let's start

133
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,760
making the wall right here

134
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,070
I don't know how I'm gonna form this

135
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,160
together ah shoot I think I think this

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,320
will eventually work

137
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,980
I hope okay no that looks pretty bad

138
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,360
okay there we go

139
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,470
there we go the more I do this the more

140
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,930
I understand how this mod works and how

141
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,330
they use dirt it's like a I'm trying to

142
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,190
think of what game is like this as well

143
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,190
it's on the tip of my frickin tongue but

144
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,850
I can't I can't even I can't think

145
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,440
there's a game just like this but it's

146
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,780
like it's like you're you're packing

147
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,820
you're packing the dirt like it's

148
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,800
play-doh it's not like placing blocks

149
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,740
okay that's pretty good that's pretty

150
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,010
good now we got most of it done now we

151
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,960
need a door I'm going to put a door on

152
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,120
it just to see how it looks with a door

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,940
all right where should we put the door

154
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,740
right here yep that looks pretty good

155
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,780
[Music]

156
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,440
okay

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,810
[Music]

158
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,160
how am I gonna form this together with

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,310
the door I'm hoping I can get this to

160
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,210
work okay okay

161
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,770
okay that actually works pretty darn

162
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,090
good we had we have a hole right here

163
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,900
though we gotta we gotta bump that in

164
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,540
there we go there we go that bad is

165
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,670
looking pretty darn good if you ask me

166
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,810
I'm impressed I'm impressed with myself

167
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,460
even though this probably takes no

168
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,490
effort at all yeah no I'm just kidding

169
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,660
it's it's an idea this mod sparks up the

170
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,130
interests in my my brain juice all right

171
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,680
oh wait what I the hell did I do wait

172
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,950
did no no I think that's what I place

173
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,120
down

174
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:46,829
um right here oh okay

175
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,620
no we can't do that but we can do that

176
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,749
except we're kind of bouldering or out

177
00:08:55,749 --> 00:09:00,550
bold yeah we we're outside of the door

178
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,160
that kind of looks funny

179
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,470
no no whatever I did I didn't do all

180
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,749
right hold on okay you know what maybe I

181
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,449
was doing it right I'm just I'm just not

182
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:21,670
thinking um no that that is not doing it

183
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,749
right did it oh wait okay that'll work

184
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:31,660
that will work but what I'm curious

185
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,699
about

186
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:41,529
well at work and what about here okay so

187
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,920
I guess this would this would kind of

188
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,290
have to be your fort it would kind of

189
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,689
look like this this is this is what you

190
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,300
you would look like if minecraft was not

191
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,850
in cubes we finally built it it looks uh

192
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,149
looks a little funny it's pretty big it

193
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,559
looks big on the outside

194
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,379
it really looks big on the outside but

195
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,990
it's honestly pretty darn small in the

196
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,949
inside so it formed really differently

197
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,589
and if this was how it was in like real

198
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,709
Minecraft it would not it it would be so

199
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,990
difficult just to make a frickin dirt

200
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,050
fortress so can we actually put put a

201
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,339
bed and sleep staring nighttime let's

202
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,220
see let's see alright that that works

203
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,350
that actually works now this is test

204
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,499
number two all right let's say let's say

205
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:45,069
what's a good one what's a good one what

206
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:47,199
about zombie pigman do zombie pigman do

207
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,420
they burn all right let's say you spawn

208
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,200
a

209
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,970
ton of zombie pigman like a lot a lot

210
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,290
right here and game-mode 0 and we decide

211
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,160
we want to be we decide we want to be a

212
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,800
little bit crazy oh my god oh my god

213
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,910
that didn't work out very good did it

214
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,310
did it no no no alright alright you know

215
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,710

219
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,150

220
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,150
reach me they can't get in in any way

221
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,690
shape or form so looks safe to me this

222
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,270
is the system as freaky as this is this

223
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,930
