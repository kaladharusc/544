1

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,200

6
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,120

7
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,629

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,850
keep running it use it was good to catch up

10
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,860
alright solid seven half-mile San Francisco run can't seem to figure out

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,910
where I'm staying

12
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,390
showered shaved cleaned

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,270
i'm in san francisco for one day just for some really uninteresting business

14
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,900
meetings

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,260
my favorite hotel is totally booked up so I rented an Airbnb

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,500
this is like somebody else's apartment i'm staying in kind of nice

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,530
it told me great run would fit in this morning

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,140
like when you stay in a hotel

19
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,600
you feel like a visitor like you're like on vacation you're visiting about when

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
you say an apartment like a residential apartment

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,890
you kind of keep leaving the town even if only there for a day yet

22
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:03,470
i'm just showing up at my first meeting right now in the hardest part of these

23
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:09,979
trips is that it be wildly inappropriate for me to bring a camera into what is a

24
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,300
business meeting

25
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
so your destination is on the right

26
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:31,250
first meeting done what well we're going to drive like 45 minutes now to mountain

27
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,020
view

28
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,370

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,840
the

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,840
it's sort of a bit of time

32
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,420
yeah

33
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:54,120

36
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,550
here like in six months ago or something like that and I haven't been back since

37
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,580

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,840
ok so you're about to get a sneak preview of boosted version 3

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,220
this is the first time ever no one's ever seen this before here it is boosted

49
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,980
version 32 bog in addition huge expectations for this how it's going to

50
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,760
be amazing

51
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,090
that's just a joke we're just kidding this is like this is where they do all

52
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,320
the testing back here

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,610
how do you get the official job to be a boost board tester and are you hiring

54
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,870
it's a careful selection process you have to prove yourself over many years

55
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,370
and miles of riding

56
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,460
what's the boost board that had the most mileage

57
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,290
so that's Matt he's put 4,000 miles on his board wonder if I've done that with

58
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,570
fists it's probably not maybe

59
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,070
so understand how you get any work done well no one's on the skate ramp

60
