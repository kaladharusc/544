453
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,560
between you and the problem eventually

454
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,620
it went away I think that must be it up

455
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,890

a kind of true or better way now of

655
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,000
course there's gonna be casualties we're

656
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,059
thieves you know world don't want us no

657
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:54,840
more

658
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,130
we are dreamers in an ever duller world

659
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,620
of facts now I'll give you that but come

660
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:16,590
on okay Dutch around here okay what you

661
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,840
want to go fishing now I went fishing

662
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,990
with Jack it was kinda nice I guess but

663
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,790
at the same time I feel like maybe we

664
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,350
should think about the long-term future

665
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,320
of us try to get the bounties off our

666
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,020
heads and whatnot and who's what's it

667
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,970
you know you know how it'd be okay

668
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,260
you're just not gonna talk to me anymore

669
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,120
Dutch is that it this do I have to fill

670
00:44:39,120 --> 00:45:05,600
the silence on my own he's just gonna

671
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,270
okay no I can tell Hosea is gonna be

672
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,390
troubling Hosea is creating not not

673
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,850
josé's greeting but Hosea is splitting

674
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,100
from Dutch in a bad way and I think

675
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,840
everyone can read the room about that

676
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,720
one Hosea is gonna betray Dutch and then

677
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,310
it's gonna be a big split in the party

678
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,630
and then everyone's gonna be like it's

679
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,630
not worth it oddly enough arthur is

680
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,040
weirdly positioned okay I guess I won't

681
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:40,220
follow them

682
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,309
curious couple and our unruly son

683
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:47,030
it feels good here you did well fine in

684
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,900
that spot Archer for Charles and me it's

685
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,440
like I can breathe again thick and soupy

686
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,380
as this air is might even do your

687
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,079
whistling pipe some good Hosea I was

688
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,130
watching in this country with Bessie

689
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,260
feels like a lifetime ago it was a

690
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,289
lifetime ago but what a life we have

691
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:12,559
lived now well we have fought especially

692
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,690
both of you I hope so

693
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,049
but now when things are desperate we

694
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:19,880
have to stick with the plan

695
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,490
make enough money then find somewhere

696
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,940
where nobody will find us we don't have

697
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,140
to hide like where I got some ideas

698
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,650
hatching but I need you with me not

699
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:39,020
against me both of you horse still we do

700
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,960
need money so keep a low profile

701
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,200
especially in the local town after

702
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,809
