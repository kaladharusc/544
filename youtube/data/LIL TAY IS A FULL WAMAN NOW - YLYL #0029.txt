Kind of want to see Shrek get married now

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:36,340
It's kind of sad that we will never see that happen. People look at the problems in the world. But what about Shrek's problem? Oh

16
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,600

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Exchanging goods and deeds and valuables that's inspiring

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,920
That doesn't make me laugh, that makes me inspired. There is hope for humanity

Morning school sign is supposed to read &quot;sewage plant field trips are today...&quot;

44
