1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,979
the Star Wars Holiday Special was a

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,130
made-for-tv event that aired in 1978 one

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,600
year after the release of a new hope

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,910
it's notorious for being incredibly hard

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,080
to find and that's not by accident

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,599
George Lucas the big man himself is

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,099
known to have been very unhappy with

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,350
this production going so far as to

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,720
actually say if I had the time and a

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
sledgehammer I would track down every

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,189
copy of that show and smash it since it

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,990
aired it's never been rebroadcast or

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,090
released on home video if the TV special

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,800
airs and no one's there to record it

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,599
then it never happened at all even

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,920
Harrison Ford seems to have no

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
recollection of making this do you

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,010
remember making this Christmas special

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,530
and it was 1978 the plot thickens how

20
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,270
could this be bad anyways look at the

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,910
cast Mark Hamill Harrison himself Carrie

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,399
Fisher the original c-3po Chewbacca r2

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,829
and James Earl Jones man they got

24
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,329
everyone I mean how have I not seen this

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,350
it sounds amazing

26
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,690
now that's it I am getting to the bottom

27
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,760
of this

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,070
come on George loosen up a bit I just

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,379
want to see it don't be such a prude I

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,600
mean I don't know maybe if you give me a

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,619
little kiss first or something

32
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,740
I just want to see the film George

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,909
well now you're getting sassy with me

34
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,619
that's gonna be two kisses now see what

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,530
happens when you sass me you're a very

36
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,190
persuasive man little kiss for daddy see

37
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,530
was that so hard all right but don't

38
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,390
show it to anyone okay I'm not very

39
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,580
proud of this be very careful with this

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,080
I can't have this leaking on the

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,740
Internet

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,270
John do you love me like I love you how

43
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:45,070
can I love

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,480
this is even more dangerous in that time

45
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,310
I tried to watch Dunston checks in on

46
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,550
laserdisc that monkey was not willing to

47
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,770
cooperate all right let's be careful

48
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:10,040
with this oh boy here we go well an okay

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,110
start I'd say the first few seconds

50
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,760
literally start off with a dogfight in

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,620
the Millennium Falcon you can't go wrong

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:15,950
there

53
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,080
I said I'm turning back

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,480
here we meet han and chewie we're trying

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,830
to get home from war for the Star Wars

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,990
equivalent of Christmas or any winter

57
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,000
timed holiday really they call it life

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
day I don't know if a holiday

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,510
celebration is what would be on my mind

60
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,010
if my space vessel were about to be

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,830
obliterated with Anthony Daniels as

62
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,900
c-3po oh that's nice

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,010
they're actually giving the real names

64
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,360
of all the people inside the costumes

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,850
Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca it's nice to

66
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,650
see them get credit for such an overall

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,360
thankless job r2d2 as r2d2 oh that's

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
real nice

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,340
give the guy in an air-conditioned

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,780
monkey suit credit but the poor

71
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,340
underpaid dwarf who's got a roast in a

72
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,709
tin can all day screw him so after the

73
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:02,820
beginning credits roll we go to

74
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,870
Chewbacca's tree mansion what Chewbacca

75
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,000
is like a rogue dirty space animal yet

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,350
he lives in this nice house that looks

77
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,030
straight off the set of a 1975 episode

78
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,100
of The Price is Right the film explains

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,990
that this is actually Chewbacca's family

80
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,720
who are all waiting for him to get back

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,810
from war I'm really glad they tackled

82
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,459
this aspect of it because all I could

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,810
think of during the action scenes in the

84
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,610
first movie was Howl's Chewbacca's kid

85
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,440
doing is he getting good grades

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
is he getting beat up in school what are

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,450
his interests

88
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,460
yeah we're already there then I guess

89
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,810
I'm gonna need the heavy-duty shit for

90
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,330
this one

91
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,880
the house is too immaculate tobacco's

92
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,410
supposed to live in a cave or something

93
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,060
they got a must need a real strong

94
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,590
vacuum to get all the fur out of the rug

95
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,630
also the place looks expensive as shit

96
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,850
this is the Star Wars equivalent of

97
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,230
living in a penthouse on Central Park

98
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,120
West where should we get the money for

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
this charging for autographs after the

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:08,980
war something is very wrong here are you

101
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,730
serious

102
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,740
is there actually gonna be no dialog

103
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,500
here actually for real is this gonna be

104
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,790
these guys grunting at each other like

105
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,799
cavemen for two hours you know I'm

106
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,540
probably just being too cynical I'm sure

107
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,799
this is just one of the many brief

108
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,570
vignettes in this vast universe just

109
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,870
getting a feel you know world building

110
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,190
they don't even seem to like each other

111
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,300
they look like they're just constantly

112
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,689
making passive-aggressive jabs

113
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:46,159
I said I'm turning back oh they left

114
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,899
this in well this is where the movie

115
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,399
gets a little dark well this isn't

116
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,079
scripted this is the actor actually

117
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,519
attempting to kill himself after he

118
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,349
realized what he took part in don't do

119
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,029
it it's not worth it there's at least

120
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,829
two good movies after they see you could

121
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,289
do wait what

122
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,629
that's just actually how the film cuts

123
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,759
together there it just comes right back

124
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,819
to them grunting what was the point of

125
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,139
that entire last part where the kid was

126
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:11,179
meditating on the meaning of life maybe

127
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,739
you're thinking okay that'll come in

128
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,569
later that'll eventually be relevant but

129
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:17,089
it never comes back it just comes and

130
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,849
goes like that in an instant before your

131
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,249
very eyes even Grandpa's confused and

132
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,779
I'm pretty sure you got a copy the

133
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:27,620
script

134
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,830
oh is that what's you know on the bill

135
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,660
for today then all right yeah that's

136
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:42,659
that's normal

137
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:48,159
you said it oh look it's Luke finally a

138
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,629
familiar face we can get away from this

139
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,900
Wookiee themed everyone loves Raymond

140
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,819
not now r2 yeah this is very important

141
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,919
shut up literal slave wage tin can boy

142
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,629
we won't even credit I don't know what

143
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,520
it is but Luke doesn't seem like himself

144
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,229
here Chewbacca

145
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,000
it will bring him to the screen I want

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:15,400
to say hello to him he's not there now

147
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,810
they're way overdue

148
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,729
god forbid he's in a vat of acid

149
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,770
somewhere in the Mojave Desert but I

150
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,449
would know nothing about that

151
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,849
it's just taking a little bit longer to

152
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,860
get there that's all he'll make it oh is

153
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,840
that right Luke well you seem a tad too

154
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,849
confident in that little assumption come

155
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,580
on tomorrow let's see a little smile

156
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,560
come on fuck fuck is that shit you're

157
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,690
doing stop it's disgusting and he was

158
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,590
never seen again

159
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,259
until in 1996 when he resurfaced under a

160
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,090
different name in Phoenix Arizona the

161
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,930
end have you liked they well good thing

162
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,699
we solved nothing here it appears the

163
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,229
story in this special keeps itself

164
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,180
moving forwards through this 1970s

165
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,770
wood-paneled computer the Wookiees have

166
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,469
just randomly the kid wookie who goes by

167
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,690
lumpy very fitting well log on to the

168
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,460
computer and a new scene will start this

169
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,050
particular scene takes place at the

170
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,789
business of an average galactic citizen

171
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,349
as an imperial trooper stops by to

172
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,909
browse oh you want to see my

173
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,430
identification she did it all by herself

174
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,400
but you might say she did it by hand

175
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,180
solo get off the stage besides shaving

176
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,350
and hair trimming it's guaranteed to

177
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,419
lift stains off clothing faces and hands

178
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,199
I'll take it good I thought you would

179
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,090
now would you like do maybe something

180
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,030
far too give me something and Trey come

181
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,919
on we can get it done behind the counter

182
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,750
faster than you can say yummy Yoda three

183
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:42,130
times I said I thought I might embarrass

184
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,289
you but I told you to accept that as a

185
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:44,770
gift

186
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,600
just take no for an answer you creep

187
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,370
don't like a bit like being about myself

188
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,030
that's why oh yeah did someone forget to

189
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,789
turn off the camera this guy's just he

190
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,610
just keeps on going then just as soon as

191
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,050
that scene ends we cut to Vader whoo

192
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,370
menacingly says that he will search

193
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,710
every house in the galaxy to find Han

194
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,440
and Chewie hmm total difference as much

195
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,020
and just as soon as that happens we cut

196
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,729
immediately back to Chewbacca's family

197
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:15,009
and find the mother watching a cooking

198
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,030
show

199
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,420
oh my god actually though just like

200
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,890
everything in this special it goes on

201
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,050
for at least 10 minutes too long I'm

202
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,420
going to be using the tenderness cut of

203
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,900
the bantha the loin side by the rules'

204
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,880
is a kitchen the best place for a wookie

205
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
anyways you'd be spending as much time

206
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,210
picking hairs out of your food as you

207
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,590
would eating it well you need a hairnet

208
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,230
for your all dang body mama wookie where

209
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,970
you gonna get that target don't sell

210
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,920
that this is the furthest thing from

211
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,050
Star Wars that could ever exist it's

212
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,090
baffling everything people liked about

213
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,950
the original films is absent here the

214
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,870
action the characters the story the

215
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,430
grittiness anything besides this no I

216
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,630
get it

217
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,010
after seeing the reception of the

218
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,720
original trilogy I can see how they

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,610
would realize it needed more Chewbacca's

220
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,710
wife cooking it's a it's a natural

221
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:21,870
progression no all was much better in

222
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,700
the next chapter of our saga the old man

223
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,980
from earlier comes over for undisclosed

224
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,960
reasons to set some stuff up for the

225
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,580
wookie family they should have just been

226
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,990
honest and called this the Chewbacca

227
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,150
family special because that's what it is

228
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,950
I thought you might like this one of

229
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,340
those that it kind of hard to explain it

230
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,330
so yeah go on

231
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,160
I'll wait well actually I don't know

232
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,450
what you mean by that but from the way

233
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,680
you said it it sounds like you gave

234
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,440
their grandpa porn I really don't want

235
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,180
to believe you gave the grandpa porn

236
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,620
I am your fantasy you gave the man boy

237
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,060
his family is like right in the other

238
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,920
room you come into the man's house on

239
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,310
fucking Christmas except interspecies VR

240
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,320
porn in his living room

241
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,450
oh is this real is this awaking

242
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,550
nightmare this got through no one

243
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,720
thought this was a bad idea

244
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,210
Wow happy life day don't worry it's not

245
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,930
over yet though

246
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,480
the next scene is Princess Leia and c3po

247
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,269
doing their taxes

248
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:30,699
deck the halls with boughs of holly near

249
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:34,040
and then back at the house there found

250
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,760
by stormtroopers you know somehow the

251
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,500
tension just doesn't translate right

252
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,389
when it's filmed in the style of Family

253
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,339
Matters also the old guy in this scene

254
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:45,199
becomes Rodney Dangerfield for like five

255
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,149
entire minutes I never leave the shop

256
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,500
without my identification they'd say

257
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,300
he's very good boy just act like this I

258
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,560
just found my identification that

259
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,699
picture you're looking at right now is

260
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,260
take quite a few years ago that's it one

261
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,540
of me I've gained quite a bit of weight

262
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,480
since if you weren't so relaxed right

263
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,120
now I think you might be up to something

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,250
yeah see no guilty man would say that oh

265
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,170
man this is getting real tense

266
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,000
Chuy's family is on the verge of getting

267
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:26,560
found out what what's happening

268
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,570
in case you didn't know that is actually

269
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,310
the band Jefferson Starship

270
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,870
it just happens it's like a full-on

271
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,030
four-minute music video hey but don't

272
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,470
get me wrong this is probably like the

273
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,240
best part of the movie because Jefferson

274
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,910
Starship is awesome it's just so jarring

275
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,290
that it's even in here at all

276
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,790
I always knew these guys were ahead of

277
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,740
their time like way ahead the trooper is

278
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,780
just sitting there genuinely enjoying it

279
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,750
it is it's funny to me he's like wow

280
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,080
starship rocks I know you'd like it your

281
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,420
work here is finished and seriously if I

282
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,860
have to listen to you play we built this

283
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,930
city in the Star Destroyer one more time

284
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,370
you know I don't even really know what's

285
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,720
going on anymore but in the spirit of

286
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,130
random things happening all the time

287
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,440
now we're in a cartoon as you can see in

288
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,030
this timeline han didn't make it out of

289
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,560
the trash compactor in time as is

290
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,270
usually the case in any film related

291
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,880
baffling travesty it slowly becomes more

292
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,740
and more of a fever dream over time like

293
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,420
the writers just started to trip out or

294
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,870
something like randomly while the

295
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,730
stormtroopers are still in his house

296
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,640
lumpy starts watching a tutorial video

297
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,010
we are watching a literal tutorial video

298
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,800
with him yes you have that right it is

299
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,470
an actual tutorial video for a fictional

300
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,720
device being played on an

301
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,340
action-oriented sci-fi holiday special I

302
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,920
think if you had the device slumpy has

303
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,270
you could actually put it together by

304
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,730
watching this no joke it goes on for

305
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,270
three and a half painstaking minutes of

306
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,490
the 10,000 terminals on your circuit

307
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,620
breaker module is mocked in a particular

308
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,630
color yeah you thought I was joking

309
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,840
didn't you like a rainbow thought I was

310
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,610
making it all up to be funny huh did to

311
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,560
the wires with the corresponding colors

312
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,620
I wish I were making it up red goes to

313
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,290
red yeah okay what's the next step

314
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,520
daddy-o ain't got all day

315
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,080
now watch me close me oh thank god he's

316
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,850
having a stroke well come on we're

317
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,380
nearing the end at least that'll be the

318
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,120
last non sequitur right just run

319
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:36,550
oh my god does that fucking PR sir of

320
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,769
all the things I did not expect from

321
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,709
this which at this point is not much Bea

322
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,050
Arthur musical was pretty high up on

323
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,079
that list don't worry it's okay though

324
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:53,819
cuz at least she does this you stay just

325
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,529
be Arthur's entire career was building

326
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,009
up to this moment I don't need to see

327
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,620
his enjoyment to whatever is happening

328

the house nothing to see here folks we

333
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,809

334
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:24,970
moon juice into a volcano head of God

335
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,680

eventually han and chewie do get back

341
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,610
home and they use some masterful tactics

342
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,380
to disarm the stormtrooper

343
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,740
that was an unfortunate chain of events

344
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,610
come on stop

345
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,870

and may the force be with you he said we

347
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,330
go home now give exit door just as life

348
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,140
day begins life itself ends the Wookiees

349
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,420
now begin their annual exodus into space

350
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,640
nearly one in three wiki's will survive

351
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,700
this journey all of you are an important

352
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,620
part of my life pal I'm glad I could be

353
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,779
here also just curious when am I getting

354
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:35,560

355
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,340
me

356
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,890
and so they celebrated their blasphemous

357
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,110
religion and peace until shortly after

358
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,370
the scene ended where they were then

359
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,110
dragged into the streets of Kashyyyk and

360
00:15:50,110 --> 00:16:11,140
stone for their infidelity the end

361
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,110
absolutely fascinating that's it that's

362
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,450
all I believe I've reviewed the worst

363
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,880
piece of Star Wars content in existence

364
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,540
and you know what that means I'm coming

365
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,630
home alright Vader I'm done come at me

366
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,190
what why isn't it working

367
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,110
it's useless I've cut the feed you're

368
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,180
pretty smart from a toad huh now you've

369
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,490
seen it the monster inside of me now you

370
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,279
understand you feel my pain and now

371
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,040
you're gonna help me help you help you

372
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,110
do what help me destroy the only thing

373
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,290
worse than the Star Wars Holiday Special

374
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,339
that's impossible

375
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,900
I've seen everything there is to see

376
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,730
what more do you want from me aren't you

377
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,680
forgetting something

378
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,620
perhaps on purpose something deep down

379
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:08,870
you don't want to remember

380
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,959
no it's not possible

381
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,430
they destroyed every last copy in the

382
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,140
war it was the only way the galaxy could

383
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,689
be free if you don't believe me take a

384
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:30,940
look for yourself

385
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,580
I don't know I just didn't see if they

386
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,930
must have cloaked it for me with sick

387
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,960
mind tricks it's almost complete why do

388
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,460
you think you were here because he

389
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,020
wanted me to play poopy games for laughs

390
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,110
and giggles just laughs and giggles poor

391
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,780
naive boy it was just a distraction the

392
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,160
anger you felt all this time was

393
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,410
extracted funneled and used to rebuild

394
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,030
this there are millions of people just

395
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,770
like you all over the galaxy

396
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,080
feeding the Empire's evil wishes one

397
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,660
Microsoft point at a time I was

398
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,740
wondering what these before why are you

399
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,870
here why me what's my part in this if

400
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,670
there's millions of people involved I

401
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,220
don't think special I'm just another cog

402
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,740
in the cosmic machine oh that's where

403
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,870
you'd be wrong silly boy don't you know

404
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,030
by now can't you feel it in your heart

405
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,790
you have something one-of-a-kind that

406
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,090
can stop this it's in you John you can

407
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,910
fix this you don't come to see it my way

408
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,850
in time you're one crazy old man Georgi

409
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,940
and all so unexpectedly smelly but I'm

410
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,659
in

411
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,909
our project is almost complete my lord

412
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,859
she shall be resurrected in no time

413
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:49,679
excellent how did you manage to get up

414
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,929
here let's just say I made a little

415
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,259
connection back at home base so now you

416
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,159
see their true power of the dark side no

417
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,109
not quite it's more of a situation where

418
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,639
I've crashed my ship into your ship and

419
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:06,409
now they're connected and now I'm here

420
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:11,249
payback time this well I'm a firm

421
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,169
believer that how you use it is the

422
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:29,279
important step how can you escape

423
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,679
possibly resist the damage of a syst

424
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:42,130
blade

425
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,550
do it

426
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:50,690
finish him No won't be like you I say do

427
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,970
it as for what someone else will just

428
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,230
make an even bigger Star Wars connect

429
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,940
and truth be told I don't even think the

430
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,710
size plays into it is it disks still

431
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,390
small did you make an equally large

432
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,330
xbox360 to accommodate him that all

433
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,270
seems so impractical you dare defy the

434
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,410
will of the Empire what do you want from

435
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,800
me I do this because I want to see

436
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,410
people all around the galaxy do the

437
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,060
funny on solo dance Oh No and I will be

438
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,180
dead you watches every last person gets

439
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,490
frustrated because the controls almost

440
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,920
wet but now I do what that's about to

441
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,890
tell impossible evil what wretched part

442
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,940
of the galaxy did you spawn from Los

443
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:42,669
Angeles

444
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:48,260
this evil world to buy chases and dying

445
00:20:48,260 --> 00:21:01,470
is what she dragged up patios

446
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:15,490
bird and real again why'd you save me

447
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,330
back there

448
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,580
you didn't have to it doesn't make sense

449
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,850
I mean Jack only responds to people with

450
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,260
