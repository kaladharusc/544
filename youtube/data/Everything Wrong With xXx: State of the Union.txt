[Music]

2
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:10,119
the sequel immediately trolled its

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,190
audience with its production logo so the

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,259
rad code right we got a six military bad

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,879
guys wait until agent farmer was able to

6
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,350
squeeze off a warning to his superiors

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,490
instead of killing him before he

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,440
discovered his dead courts discount Nick

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,480
Fury even we love unarmed office lady

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,130
decides to leave the relative security

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,690
of her walled cubicle to wander into a

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,340
hallway with no cover soldier is way

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,080
more USS enterprise but I think the

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,520
movie intended even though Givens put

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,050
the bunker on lockdown these giant doors

16
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,149
remain open I really think she's

17
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,230
everywhere they've covered all the hall

18
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,879
actually you know they've only blocked

19
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,350
about half the halls so unless this

20
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,210
underground bunker only has one entrance

21
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,890
and exit you've got some outs highly

22
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,539
trained security agent Gibbons just lets

23
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,069
this little flying camera look right out

24
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,149
and long enough to gather information

25
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,069
about who use and is whereabouts in the

26
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:51,159
bunker ah where the are they going to go

27
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,109
they lock this room down so the only way

28
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,429
out of here is through the large men

29
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,960
with guns maybe just say bend over and

30
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,859
kiss your ass good-bye

31
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,539
so now is this off this time sir then

32
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,219
diesel Gibbons and shavers escaped

33
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,690
without even one of those heavily armed

34
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,969
assholes chasing after them the new xxx

35
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,210
has got to be more dangerous deadly Adam

36
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,400
that's Gibbons focus on attitude instead

37
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,050
of security and research and development

38
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,760
is why he just left behind dozens of

39
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,230
murdered colleagues and state secrets

40
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,090
also Gibbons is already looking for the

41
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,860
next xxx even before he realizes the

42
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,810
first one is dead also sure the first

43
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,790
xxx had some sort of purpose to be a new

44
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,350
goddamn superhero but at this point in

45
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,700
the franchise we'll just take anything

46
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,440
ex-military that's previously worked

47
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,820
with us almost a minute and a half of

48
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,620
grandiose mission impossible x-men James

49
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,300
Bond style credits to pad the runtime of

50
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,920
a mercifully short movie yes I know

51
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,540
might be sequel to a hit movie logic

52
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,190
will Dafoe is going to speed to cruise

53
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,690
control this movie as the villain this

54
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,850
is a laundry list of suspects that

55
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,340
covers half the world well you better

56
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,690
get cracking on it instead of standing

57
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,400
around expositor about a legislative

58
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,080
MacGuffin society please

59
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,320
okay so I encourage on fact if you play

60
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,090
a Jedi in a Star Wars movie you retain

61
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,980
Jedi mind-trick towers and all the other

62
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,240
movies you're in which explains why

63
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,800
discard just leaves without questioning

64
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,060
whether Givens is actually dismantle

65
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,100
order I always tell the ones that we

66
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,840
captured in the wild I don't look in

67
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
their eyes well it's cute how even after

68
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,290
all this time they still complete each

69
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,760
other's sentences also this is a

70
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,530
masterclass on my Ice Cube should have

71
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,390
continued his rap career I liked what

72
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,510
she did with chips

73
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,030
Darius burns given so hard well it was

74
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,860
very perfect but that was sick also

75
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,019
that's faces should any job at the NSA

76
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,940
have enormous ly identifiable writing on

77
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,069
the uniform standard cage was killed in

78
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,290
bora-bora last night Jerry's dead until

79
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,790
it becomes financially relevant for him

80
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,470
to come back he was one of only three

81
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,480
men with access to that elevator you

82
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,830
know the one that leads to sweet escape

83
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,030
from the death bunker and has been in

84
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,890
plain sight of all the other NSA staff

85
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,709
the other two and can medium inasmuch

86
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,079
savings wait what about shavers who was

87
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,730
hiding in the garage he had to have that

88
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,349
access it should be an accounted for -

89
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,090
just to prison architect if you want to

90
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,470
keep your prisoners from escaping remove

91
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,090
the design flaw of the rigid pole right

92
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,319
next to the door handle that is an

93
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,030
impediment to inmate chasing key and

94
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,379
under that bed he just kicked through

95
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,060
seems to have magical regenerative

96
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,170
powers because it is now completely

97
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,319
intact the plaintive wail of the one

98
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,700
guard who truly loved him was drowned

99
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,230
out by Darius's obligation to his

100
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,000
country nobody noticed this booking

101
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,590
helicopter until right the second to get

102
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,000
in shape for this role cube did ten

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,769
bicep curls before the shot and called

104
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,370
it a day

105
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,760
nice huh you just escaped at 12:04 get

106
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,739
and said 1206 was the extraction and

107
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,359
that was literally the only moment you

108
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,680
could have hopped on the chopper so this

109
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,030
seems more like an excuse to deliver a

110
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,859
stupid action movie line you know the

111
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,959
police have helicopters to Jesus Gibbons

112
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,340
has the ability to flee the scene of all

113
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,019
major disasters without anyone pursuing

114
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,030
it she had large and extra-large but do

115
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,250
you have a triple XL serious song cell

116
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,769
block a not anymore Darius stone no

117
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,959
longer exists but how all the guards in

118
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,669
the prison he just escaped no he exists

119
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,440
and the NSA later pulls his entire file

120
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,090
you're the new xxx porno star for what

121
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,260
happens at all xxx

122
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,239
he's dead yeah but that just happened

123
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,829
last night and given to us and busy

124
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,180
preparing this Prison Break on his own

125
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,709
so how did he hear about it especially

126
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,480
you know what temp being outside of the

127
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,370
NSA and everything we need to go to work

128
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,379
now I need to give him a surprise in

129
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,790
another shake somehow the conversation

130
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,500
between cube and his personal trainer

131
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,389
made it into the script what else can

132
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,419
you do last xxx he could ski surf

133
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,650
through all kinds of stuff

134
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,209
this is an excellent question Gibbons

135
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,859
means the next xxx to be in deep cover

136
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,959
and use non-traditional methods so of

137
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,010
course he picks a career military

138
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,569

139
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,120
rain we gonna need something any media

140
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,070
most ironically the person who said this

141
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,510
in a pre testing meeting was immediately

142
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,030

shops without knowing a thing about the

149
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,460
mission make that into a personal aim

150
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,190
you know discount Scotty Jason no you

151
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,270
haven't told them anything about the

152
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,860
Commission besides the next location

153
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,840
just on intelligence compound is teeming

154
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
with agents none of them think to look

155
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,450
at the road where there's a

156
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,800
conspicuously tricked-out truck

157
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
containing a dude with binoculars you

158
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,520
can hold the floor everybody else follow

159
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,130
me there are dozens of NSA troops on the

160
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,540
farm but agent underworld leaves only

161
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,370
two assholes to guard the actual agency

162
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,000
compound

163
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,650
Tereus drops in through this hole that's

164
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,150
left completely open to move with

165
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,710
impunity into a bunker of its similarly

166
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,360
unguarded so he should be called mission

167
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,580
reasonable and main room even though

168
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,170
Gibbons and stone went over a layout of

169
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,670
the bunker the night before movie still

170
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,230
finds it necessary to have shavers walk

171
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,170
him through navigating the NSA bunker

172
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,330
free drive space oh you're telling me

173
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,890
the NSA didn't already take the hard

174
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,870
drives from the secret location also how

175
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,010
long are these agents just going to hang

176
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,570
around this crime scene get into went

177
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,040
all the way to Kansas wait until the

178
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
next day to get Darius out then it took

179
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,890
at least another day for them to get

180
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,440
back to DC then they off lucky for stone

181
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,850
these boats still have the keys in them

182
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,070
no one's really starting to miss the old

183
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,050
circle oh jesus this movie is hammering

184
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,340
the fact that Ice Cube has not been

185
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,230
diesel okay he's not a muscle-bound job

186
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,260
but could then make it was a good day

187
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,050
humble Wow I hope they use extra Elmer's

188
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,610
glue on that boat before stuff like this

189
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,620
top guy realizes that it's in this movie

190
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,240
and takes the smart way out by bursting

191
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,470
into flames and jumping into the river

192
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,170
trance Knifer the highest dive in navy

193
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,760
history and we needed to give him some

194
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
sort of extreme ability so that we could

195
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
justify spending 90 million on this

196
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,890
piece of footage we have on them a

197
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,750
meeting with his lawyer okay this is the

198
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,000
NS King a but no one recognized the

199
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,620
wanted former agent that's m.i.a and

200
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,020
this footage till now breeze it blow it

201
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,570
up zoom an enhance cliche as a drink I

202
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,700
took the liberty of pour well without

203
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,680
faking liberties Gibbons mistakenly

204
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,150
thinks he has a pawn pointed at is head

205
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,070
and never ask you to go into that fire

206
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,320
no you just sit it in watch it all right

207
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,610
you know what this foreigner is about an

208
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,500
X Games athlete turned government spook

209
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,870
needs wartime backstory just so you know

210
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,330
but every year up to did not get away

211
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,920
with it thankfully this is what the box

212
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,600
office said to this movie Darius stone

213
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,680
is going to stop me

214
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,870
is that supposed to be a surprise this

215
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,160
is a legitimate question given

216
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
flamboyantly broke him out of prison and

217
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,980
several dozen people saw stone

218
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,510
inexplicably blow up a bunch of

219
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,010
different modes of transportation they

220
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,420
haven't exactly been subtle about it

221
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,100
make it look like an accident

222
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,540
it's not that I'm mad the villain leaves

223
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,980
this highly trained super agent in the

224
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,600
hands of a minor henchmen it's more but

225
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,180
I don't give a thousand Augustus given

226
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,280
was a former Navy captain wait are they

227
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,600
just sitting around watching the news

228
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
and this came on now also they have

229
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,860
known that went down as the NSA FBI

230
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,380
Joint Chiefs Secretary of State but

231
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,700
apparently there's no security detail

232
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,870
around them that would notice one of the

233
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,190
most wanted men in the country several

234
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,230
yards away also earlier agent Kate

235
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,880
Beckinsale's booty-call said they were

236
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
going after Givens meaning he dissented

237
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,390
on rogue and was not in the good graces

238
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,010
of the government but the Secretary of

239
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,420
State shows up to his funeral

240
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,650
sharni you found her this is the only

241
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,910
way they could find the person named

242
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,410
curly on the microfiche thingy they

243
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,790
found on the drive go to get into the

244
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,140
funeral and find a hottest chick there

245
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,390
and look for a guy like me it was nice

246
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,890
like this unless they were you know

247
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,330
following up on all the lead from

248
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,800
Gibbons like they literally said they

249
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,450
would do a few minutes ago stay drinking

250
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,400
and the aid to the system

251
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,770
Terry action terrific this action

252
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,000
thriller threw in some political

253
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,110
intrigue that is not their political

254
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,270
more intriguing Cassio Younis

255
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,340
and none of them recognize you he does

256
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,440
we generally was talking to Jack's

257
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,150
Pentagon as if this poor bastard were

258
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,260
insulted enough by Darius the

259
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,760
screenwriters had to name him after a

260
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,190
spiteful erection we go back 30s Jack

261
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,960
never questioned my command

262
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,790
Decker continues his bad guy in cliche

263
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,889
bukakke by expositing right in the

innuendo that will make you hungry for

272
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,440
four hundred Alex highly-trained

273
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
professional killer sees a random gun on

274
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,350
the floor and immediately picks it up I

275
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,520
don't care how important this dead guy

276
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,990

the Chairman's still in there though

281
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,630
right they still come up with a

282
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,190
hilariously arbitrary deadline for

283
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,599
breaching the house I got him

284
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,520
looks like upstairs bathroom earlier we

285
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,349
saw Darius microwaving various frozen

286
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,820
dinner and meats to throw off the heat

287
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,620
signature but Kenley's can't seriously

288
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,700
not tell the difference between a

289
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,469
banquet meal and a human being at one

290
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,089
point after watching a million movies

291
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,500
where people assume the SWAT members

292
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,240
uniforms to conceal their identities do

293
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,260
they think about doing away with the

294
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,180
masks this TV gets more screen time than

295
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,040
Samuel Jackson and Bowie you know you

296
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,990

298
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,020
place to crash our exhibit booted him

299
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,459
out and now she's mixed up in the

300
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,230
military coup but somehow looks like she

301
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,300
ingested half a bottle of xanax you live

302
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,520
on a damage we did in back see the

303
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,320
literal American armed forces are coming

304
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,910
after Darius but he's going to reminisce

305
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,500
about the booty he got his old Mustang

306
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,650
for several minutes mmm D it should be

307
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,150

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,320
to explain to a Navy veteran what a

312
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,570

Jesus don't these bad guys have any dark

319
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,630
hallways or closets to do their business

320
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,130

321
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,660
special black vinyl villain suit for

322
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,059

325
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,269
bite ice and his cubes well you guys

326

330
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,889
clear shot at Darius here because like

331
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,149
me they didn't think he could actually

332
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,769
pull himself up like God issues actually

333
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,209
getting into the fight and instead

334
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,709
stands around like a dickhole yelling

335
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,019
into the walkie-talkie yeah sergeant

336
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,399
Cobb summarizes the experience of

337
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,869
watching this movie what exactly did

338
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,039
Darius hope to accomplish on this

339
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,659
mission to the carrier even he couldn't

340
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:12,649
have thought this movie was stupid

341
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,819
enough to allow someone to just have

342
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,739
obvious top-secret Intel on their person

343
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:16,729
that he could just whip out of their

344
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,379
pocket magic water bullets are not quite

345
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:21,169
magic enough to hit a sizeable target ah

346
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,329
quad via the NSA is in the middle of a

347
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,069
massive manhunt but agent dude that dumb

348
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,689
Felicity has time for a goddamn boxing

349
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,909
match you're not World War 4 I think

350
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,829
stone lost count of his world wars what

351
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,289
did you wrong I was wrong but she was

352
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,449
more than just another stone gets all

353
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,219
pissy about Steel reasonably questioning

354
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,449
his conspiracy theory about the

355
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,769
Secretary of Defense plotting to kill

356
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,299
the president dude the entirety of the

357
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,799
US government is looking for Darius but

358
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,809
this one guy tracks him down in a matter

359
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,169
of minutes can he be the next xxx

360
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:50,119
president VP bigger the house secondary

361
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,769
estate the chain of command actually no

362
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,479
first off it's the chain of succession

363
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,099
not the chain of command second it goes

364
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,059
from the president to vice president

365
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,009
then Speaker of the House president pro

366
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,839
tempore of the Senate Secretary of State

367
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,879
Secretary of Treasury then Secretary of

368
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,619
Defense so this little civics lesson is

369
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,239
wrong but hey who would have expected

370
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,559
the screenwriters to do a five-second

371
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,749
Google search ha side two bucks are you

372

377
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,279

379
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,549
been set up at this chop shop for a

380
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,169
couple of days but shavers does happen

381
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,669
to cue a bunch of bulls up in his spare

382
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,859
time Darius and his crew hijack a truck

383
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,239
with government artillery in broad

384
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:29,989
daylight

385
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,129
isn't anyone keeping an eye on this

386
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,510
vehicle is an engine

387
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,120
what can men do well if that man were

388
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,160
say been diesel we'd be a little more

389
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,139
work the fate of the free world in the

390
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,850
hands of a bunch of huncles and see

391
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,680
darius makes a similar comment to a

392
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,240
typical Facebook post by my aunt Debbie

393
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,199

394

the stupid white boy moment as I am that

395
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,139

396
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:53,910
Darius X wow this State of the Union

397
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,620
address is pretty sparsely attended I

398
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,089
guess Congress got stuck in traffic or

399
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:59,399
something oh yeah is there a way to

400

expertly maneuvered a tank on the

409
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,339
aircraft carrier right not as the

410
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,630
president not killed like everyone else

414
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,750
this asshole trying to break down a door

415
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,310
into the Capitol while his partners

416
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,870
prepare to blow a hole in the side of it

417
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,040
as almost made launching this movie

418
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,100

a sex budget on the prison escape

429
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,769
Sam Jackson got the crew from deep blue

430

436
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,510
as a bullet train if the tires blew out

437
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,620

447
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,620
paying attention but me also Deckard has

448
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,209
a massive pregnant pause before killing

449
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,069
