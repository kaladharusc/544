1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,879
don't make me that asshole Amanda don't

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,290
make me that asshole

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,660
don't make me that asshole that doesn't

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,660
recommend break it Ralph - hey okay okay

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,480
if you got kids they'll probably like

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,970
this fine if you saw the trailer for

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,949
this movie and you're like that looks

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,869
like a lot of fun I laughed at the

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,939
trailer I had a good time you'll

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,840
probably like this fine if you're

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
looking for something on par with like a

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,630
lot of the really surprisingly really

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,940
good Disney stuff that's been coming out

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,100
lately and by lately I mean like the

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,280
past five six years and Pixar material

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,940
and so forth saying up the standards man

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,910
to just say okay this has a very good

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,090
message this has a very good you know

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,100
kind of idea behind it honestly if I was

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,219
like a producer or somebody at Disney

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,620
and somebody told me this idea I think

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,659
it's a good idea um but it just doesn't

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,729
flow man it doesn't connect from one

24
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,880
thing to next and I just I it wasn't

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,830
grabbing me I just wasn't feeling it um

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,159
I feel so I feel so dirty saying that

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,750
because it's wreck-it Ralph and I and I

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,640
really liked the first film and I

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,400
thought it was cute and nice and and had

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,740
a good moral and that the sequel just

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,619
did did not live up to the expectation

32
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,509
that I felt a good movie like that

33
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,670
deserved I mean like like a really good

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,350
follow-up but it's not it's not awful

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,200
it's not a terrible film it's not even

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,360
really that bad like I said for a kid's

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,390
film about a little video game character

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,280
it goes into the internet it's fine but

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,619
before the adults and Disney snobs like

40
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,829
me that really really sort of put them

41
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,540
on a pedestal and really expect them to

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,579
meet those expectations and really

43
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,700
really set the standards high I mean you

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,829
could argue that's not fair but Disney

45
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,710
is like they really do set the standards

46
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,380
on so many things and

47
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,510
and wreck-it Ralph kinda did too in some

48
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,300
respects so so let's talk about it the

49
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,860
set up I think a lot of you probably

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,110
know you watch the trailer

51
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,950
it's a Ralph and vanellope go into the

52
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,470
Internet her game is going to be turned

53
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,740
off unless they can get this new part on

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,850
eBay or as he calls an e boy or it comes

55
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,780
a bunch of different names so they have

56
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,130
to go get the part

57
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,100
somehow come up with money to pay for

58
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,260
this part because they put like a

59
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,180
ridiculous amount of money on it to win

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,300
it and they find all sorts of various

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,220
ways they can make that money online

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,370
honestly if it was this easy like a lot

63
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,820
of other people would have done it but I

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,230
guess I guess it kind of makes sense

65
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,580
because they kind of stumble into it

66
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,640
they and this is part of the problem

67
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,200
okay so they go to something called buzz

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,370
tube and it sort of ties into all the

69
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,880
things that like our big memes and sort

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
of these funny little videos and stuff

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,180
like that and it's one of those things

72
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,580
where it's like but they can't say

73
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,530
BuzzFeed and they can't say YouTube even

74
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,330
though they're in the movie they're like

75
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,010
in the background there they are they

76
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,590
they can't really connect it to that

77
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,750
Matt that's part of the problem that

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,110
that's a very small part so so they have

79
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,350
to get the money to get this part to

80
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,620
save her game Penelope's game but then

81
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,709
that's kind of abandoned uh that's kind

82
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,390
of not a thing anymore and they they

83
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,340
just kind of forget about it and I don't

84
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,959
even really forget about just something

85
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,180
else kind of catches their interest and

86
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,630
then that becomes the story and that's

87
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,030
one of the major problems of this is

88
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,730
that it just kind of with the first film

89
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,910
you get it he's sick of doing the same

90
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,800
thing over and over he said could being

91
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
the bad guy and I even do the same thing

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,410
over and over it just said could be in

93
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,930
the bad guy and so he wants to be the

94
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,090
hero and everyone can tend to fight with

95
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,080
that so he has to go and you know get

96
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,639
something that recognizes him

97
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,770
a hero and he comes across this goes

98
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,120
into a different realm and comes across

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,860
this little kid they be friends and even

100
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,719
though he doesn't become the hero in the

101
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,520
way he thought he becomes a hero in a

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,310
different way to this kid and in the

103
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,430
movie he still has the little metal you

104
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,960
know the little sugar cookie medal and

105
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,870
it's very cute um everyone can identify

106
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,870
with that this starts off our world is

107
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,590
gonna disappear we need to save it

108
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,520
identifiable we can all relate to that

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,129
uh and then suddenly halfway through

110
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,189
it's about know I think I belong here

111
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,650
now this is my new home I want to be

112
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,900
here and it's about another person

113
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,080
accepting that and the thing is it's not

114
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,990
like it doesn't set it up at all that

115
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,300
like they are dropping kind of hints in

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,180
there but it's kind of done in a way

117
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,469
that doesn't feel natural

118
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:16,069
um if for example the character wants to

119
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,860
go and be somewhere else feels like in

120
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,839
the previous film this was the character

121
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,529
that wanted to be long was an outcast

122
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,419
and wanted to actually belong somewhere

123
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,180
it finally gets you know to that place

124
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,069
that they want to be at the end where

125
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,639
the other character is okay doing the

126
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,830
same thing you know you know has done

127
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,120
the same thing over and over to it just

128
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,330
just wants to be you know it kind of is

129
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,009
seen as something greater than what eeeh

130
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,509
they've seen it you know get some

131
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,279
recognition so I feel like this should

132
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,110
have been switched the character wants

133
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,689
to go into another realm should probably

134
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,789
be the other one in this it should

135
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,060
probably be switched around uh and I

136
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,379
think that's one of the big problems is

137
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,789
that it doesn't feel like what the

138
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,759
characters are doing kind of goes along

139
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,330
this natural journey that like a

140
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,159
character should be going through they

141
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,870
kind of say while I'm feeling this right

142
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,300
now and then something comes along too

143
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,110
you know to help them with that where it

144
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,759
doesn't feel like they really went

145
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,289
through a long journey that went through

146
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,509
sort of all these different stepping

147
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:22,610
stones and these sort of twists and

148
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,379
turns that really tie into their

149
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,029
character that would leave into this it

150
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,649
just sort of seems like they said they

151
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:30,620
want this now and everything in this

152
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,509
just kind of jumps from well now we're

153
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:33,769
gonna do this thing well now we're gonna

154
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,330
do that thing well now we're interested

155
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,620
this well now we're interested in that

156
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,539
and it kind of goes back and forth

157
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,409
constantly until we go from I don't want

158
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,590
to lose my home to I don't want to lose

159
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,340
my friend who even that's not right it's

160
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,590
I don't want to lose my home to now I

161
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,889
want this home to hey I'm okay with

162
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,840
everything - hey I don't want to lose my

163
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,509
friend and it's kind of these different

164
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,270
elements that are interesting elements

165
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,280
that can be made you know really cool if

166
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,990
they stuck to just one of them but

167
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,759
they're kind of throwing these four

168
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,280
different you know there's four

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,659
different puzzle pieces in there and

170
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:15,680
they don't quite match up and the

171
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,310
internet itself in this you've seen

172
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,930
everywhere this is every sci-fi show

173
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,289
cartoon comic whatever that has said

174
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,229
let's turn the internet into a world

175
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,000
it's all of that and you've seen it

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,590
except it's Disney so you can't add the

177
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,870
edge to it like Futurama that's a great

178
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,479
example uh you know I wanted to going to

179
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,099
the internet and and there they are and

180
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,830
it looks exactly like how it does here

181
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,319
like every person that does going into

182
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,650
the Internet looks like and but Futurama

183
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,180
and that's for adults so they can get

184
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,460
away with a lot more adult jokes and

185
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
they can really address stuff on the

186
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,379
Internet here when they go by Twitter

187
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,210
what great commentary you could do with

188
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,449
that they don't because it's Disney so

189
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,279
you just see some birds flying around

190
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,219
and you see a bunch of pictures of like

191
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,949
grumpy cat being passed around that

192
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,800
that's their Twitter commentary you know

193
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,479
it YouTube is somewhere in the

194
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,310
background but even when they do their

195
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,589
satire of like YouTube and Facebook and

196
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:24,379
just cancel show media in general it's

197
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,089
just kind of along the lines of like

198
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,039
well it's just getting a lot of shares

199
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,610
is good and even like even like Ralph

200
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,490
goes and looks at the comments which is

201
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,959
everybody knows you never read the

202
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,919
comments but you can't go with comments

203
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,470
you have to go all the way or you have

204
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,410
to go something beyond Disney you know

205
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,150
with this

206
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,370
you know the movies friggin peachy and

207
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,280
it's like why not you know I don't even

208
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,260
know that I'm just assuming it's peachy

209
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,840
because every G movie is peachy now for

210
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,390
no reason except to get slightly older

211
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,920
kids in there to think it's cool because

212
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,570
you know Disney used to be really good

213
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,000
at saying hey we're G and we don't care

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,950
we're doing our own thing but now they

215
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,540
got to put the P in front of there

216
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,060
because I don't know they throw in a

217
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,220
foot size joke like in frozen it's only

218
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,080
has to be PG it's totally dumb but shit

219
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,440
I hope this isn't genome ass but

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,920
regardless I'm getting out track um you

221
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,400
are still not allowed to do proper

222
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,010
commentary on the internet without kind

223
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,600
of having a little bit of an edge to it

224
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,950
without taking a little bit of a step

225
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,140
and this is trying to do commentary and

226
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,690
it's it's not even really doing

227
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,850
commentary until the second half and the

228
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,590
second half is where it almost starts to

229
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,890
get interesting but it so nails the

230
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,790
hammer on the head that it's just I

231
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,040
don't know there's no interpretation of

232
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,690
it there's which I don't need like a ton

233
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,610
of interpretation but like a little bit

234
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,720
but this is so spelled out so ok so it

235
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,070
without getting too much into spoilers

236
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,400
uh

237
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,010
the person that wants to go to a

238
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,810
different world wants to leave the

239
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,400
arcade behind you know the other friend

240
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,470
doesn't want that person to go so they

241
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,510
want to corrupt the game they want to

242
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,720
glitch it up they want to ruin the world

243
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,340
which is already a really douchey move

244
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,680
uh you know is somewhere the other

245
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,140
person says this isn't what true friends

246
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,170
do and I'm like yeah it like it's a

247
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,680
really unrelatable thing like it's one

248
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
thing to not want a friend leave but you

249
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,360
are just going to this really bizarre

250
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
extreme that also seems really out of

251
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,170
character and I just wasn't liking this

252
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,730
character now I mean it's one of those

253
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,990
things where you're kind of watch again

254
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,670
and like well why am I supposed to be

255
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,650
rooting for this person now I don't like

256
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,360
this person doing this I mean this

257
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,680
person seemed really cool it just

258
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,810
doesn't seem like what this person would

259
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,960
do so so they have to go in and

260
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,470
corrupt the system and get again the

261
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,110
subtle commentary um they have to look

262
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,150
for insecurities in the system in the

263
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,710
internet they had to look for

264
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:19,610
insecurities get it get it like yes you

265
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,010
could have just said problems you could

266
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,420
have just said you could have even said

267
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,520
glitches like tying it back to Penelope

268
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,880
or something but it's like no they said

269
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,190
insecurities and just guess where that's

270
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,100
gonna go just take a wild guess where

271
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,400
that's gonna go with the internet and

272
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,170
program insecurities it goes exactly

273
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,190
where you think it's gonna go so you get

274
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,020
a little bit of creative imagery with

275
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,250
multiplying the insecurities again I

276
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,740
won't give too much away but it results

277
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,050
in another giant monster and again it's

278
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,060
it's one of those detail giant monsters

279
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,380
I'll give it that where when you look

280
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,930
really close yeah you see what makes it

281
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,370
up and it's actually kind of creepy

282
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,400
which I enjoy um and on the one hand

283
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,250
it's like there's no true villain in

284
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,400
this and I I like films that do that

285
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,050
where you know it could be so easy to

286
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,190
put a villain in there but they don't

287
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,490
necessarily do it but at the same time

288
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,560
this is weirdly a movie that could have

289
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,470
used a true villain because the way they

290
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,560
sort of put all the blame and insecurity

291
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,900
on this one character just seemed really

292
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,970
out of nowhere I mean I guess they're

293
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,850
building it up a touch but connected to

294
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,070
the last movie and even the beginning of

295
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,870
this movie like it just doesn't connect

296
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,160
like this is something that would

297
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,830
destroy a friendship and maybe that's

298
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,770
just cynical me talking about it I don't

299
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,150
know but it's one of those things where

300
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,620
I'm like I'm just watching this and it's

301
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,890
like again if this realm exists in this

302
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,750
world exist in someone did this to me

303
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,910
like I I'd be like no that that this

304
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,560
person's out this person is unstable

305
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,480
this I can't be friends with this person

306
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,690
uh so just the idea that we're supposed

307
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,570
to still relate with this relationship

308
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,690
but with this connection after this one

309
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,240
character does something really bad I I

310
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,550
don't I don't follow it I didn't

311
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,950
not make that connection even though I

312
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,070
mean the analogy they're making about

313
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,720
insecurities and not a very vague

314
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
analogy but you know the analogy they

315
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,260
make is legit and it is interesting but

316
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,839
if you really want to do this you you

317
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
kind of have to go several steps further

318
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,519
I was gonna say all the way but it's

319
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,079
like the Internet is so popular and so

320
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,970
everywhere like I'm like oh okay you you

321
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,529
can kind of you can take one or two

322
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,279
steps back but this is just how no you

323
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,980
can't do it in this Disney kind of fairy

324
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,010
tale realm and it never really dawned on

325
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,190
me going into this that of course you

326
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,380
wouldn't be able to do this you know it

327
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,630
with the brand that Disney has made all

328
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,820
the Disney Princesses are in this of

329
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,740
course you're not going to be able to

330
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,070
dive into the real pros and the real

331
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,079
cons of the Internet

332
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,279
you know and it's something where if

333
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,700
you're watching the the trailer for this

334
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,370
and you're not laughing that much you're

335
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,870
gonna get the same experience with the

336
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,149
movie when I was watching the trailer I

337
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,490
was like man this I me it's wrecking

338
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,740
Ralph's I mean it's gotta be good but

339
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,930
yeah be sure to show a lot of them the

340
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,459
princess is in there like that really

341
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,310
goes on a long time and it got a few

342
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,350
laughs but by manon and nothing that

343
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,930
major that's like the funniest part of

344
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,630
the movie like the stuff with the

345
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,060
princesses at least in that section they

346
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,040
come back again at the end it's kind of

347
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,320
dumb but but the section where Penelope

348
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,640
and she goes and meets the princesses

349
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,740
it's kind of funny like they draw a

350
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,110
connection to Penelope he's trying to

351
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,820
find what she really wants and they say

352
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,310
have you tried looking at water and I

353
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,470
didn't get that and then they said well

354
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,540
no all the princesses you know we

355
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,370
suddenly realize what we want and we

356
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,310
sing a song when we look at water and I

357
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,899
thought about in the Chi list a few

358
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,520
examples I'm like that's a really good

359
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,410
point I never thought about that that

360
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,209
was like actually really really funny

361
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,529
and I don't know if that felt like the

362
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:19,040
closest to kind of you know poking holes

363
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,990
in the armor kind of showing that yeah

364
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,420
they're Disney but they can you know

365
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,620
sort show their flaws as well and I fell

366
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,050
I feel like we needed more of that with

367
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,300
the internet but you can't because

368
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,310
everyone knows what's on the Internet

369
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,320
everyone knows you know how they go to

370
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,650
the dark web in this of course you're

371
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,320
not going to be able to do as crazy or

372
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,410
insane jokes as you want to do with the

373
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,020
dark net in this so you have to settle

374
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,560
for this really g-rated version of the

375
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,770
dark net which is honestly nothing it

376
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,630
just kind of feels like another version

377
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,640
of the emoji movie you know it honestly

378
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,290
okay I can't see the emoji movie made

379
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,590
better analogies I won't go that far

380
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,480
but it's one of those things where it's

381
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,220
like even like I don't know the color

382
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,470
seemed a little bit more vibrant in the

383
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,300
emoji movie and even though the worlds

384
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,420
look very similar but like I said

385
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,610
everybody that's done a version of the

386
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,500
internet it has done this world it's

387
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,190
always this world the light blue sort of

388
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,700
very flat you know it's just some very

389
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,370
basic shapes sort of blue white you know

390
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,500
these very square objects walking around

391
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,570
square faces or round faces and then

392
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,150
that's it and I just feel like it's the

393
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,340
Internet really so boring they always

394
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,230
talk about how just vast and

395
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,730
never-ending it is and so many

396
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,500
possibilities and how come we always

397
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,650
come back to the exact same designs for

398
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,290
this place this incredible place you

399
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,090
know we're like anything is possible any

400
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,970
great thing any terrible thing at any

401
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,560
anything is possible on the Internet and

402
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
we keep coming back to this same setup

403
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,840
um so yeah the big thing too maybe I

404
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,460
could have gone through it a little bit

405
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,760
better if it was funnier it's just not

406
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,550
that funny and it's not even like

407
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,950
they're throwing okay like the emoji

408
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,990
movie well try throwing a lot of jokes

409
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,170
to you ah they don't work and they're

410
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,400
annoying you know that's why something

411
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,980
like that is you see it's really bad uh

412
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,620
we're this it's either not throwing that

413
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,140
many jokes at you or the jokes it does

414
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,680
throw you are not really good but but

415
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,070
they're not groaners either they're just

416
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,500
kind of meh like well yeah that's the

417
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,240
obvious joke you and make there you know

418
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,220
kind of thing um so yeah I don't know

419
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,220
that this is not I feel bad cuz it's

420
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,320
hard to say this is like a bad movie

421
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,660
it's not a movie I see and I'm like oh

422
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,140
my god this is just I can't watch it but

423
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,390
if I saw this like halfway through and

424
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,670
somebody said I could never find out

425
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,200
what happens and the rest of it might be

426
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,720
okay you know I want it to be like no I

427
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,390
have to find out I have to I'm so

428
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,280
invested in their journey and what

429
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,690
they're gonna discover next it's like

430
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,540
I'd really be fine we're in the first

431
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,490
film I couldn't I'd have to know what's

432
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,350
going on and the first film was funny

433
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,200
because it was almost it was almost a

434
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,640
letdown that there weren't as many video

435
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,160
game characters or tie-ins as I wanted

436
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
and now compared to this one's a lot

437
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,820
more than you know they give credit for

438
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,590
but it's still one of those where it's

439
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,860
like I kind of put that aside cuz I was

440
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,600
so invested in the story and I was so

441
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,460
invested in these characters and what

442
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,950
they were going through and then this

443
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,010
one like it opens up with when he got

444
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,350
fix-it Felix and I I forget her name the

445
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,330
Jane Lynch character they volunteered to

446
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,460
adopt some of the racers you know all

447
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,080
the racers from sugar rush are little

448
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,010
kids so they volunteered to adopt them

449
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,500
and I'm like this is gonna be fine this

450
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,390
is gonna be really hilarious oh my god

451
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,010
like this couple is already so funny

452
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,410
this tiny little fix a guy in this giant

453
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,930
warrior woman and they're together you

454
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,060
know the total opposites and then you

455
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,980
have now they're gonna have these little

456
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,920
kids and the guy is even warning them

457
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,500
like you know and if kids aren't exactly

458
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,090
what you think it's like oh it'll be

459
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,040
wonderful be just what we need to spice

460
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,720
up our relationship like it's really

461
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,810
setting up that this is gonna be

462
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,520
something really crazy really insane and

463
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,440
really funny

464
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,360
never comes back again until the end

465
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,400
like why even have that there well why

466
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,590
have that set up if you're never gonna

467
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,510
do anything and why build it up if

468
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,600
you're not gonna constantly deliver you

469
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,670
know with the jokes and there's one joke

470
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,280
at the end and it's cute you know but

471
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,860
it's like why have that set up I even

472
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,940
had them in the movie so yeah and the

473
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,500
other characters they discover in this

474
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,630
the only one that got legitimate laugh

475
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,540
out of me is this character named Gort

476
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,850
and he never says a thing he's a

477
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,210
throwaway joke honestly I doubt anyone

478
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,310
else will laugh but he made me laugh

479
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,160
because like it's this guy who's kind of

480
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,170
he's this shady you know guy who sells

481
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,790
ads and you know I make him money

482
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,060
playing video games and stuff and just

483
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,410
whenever he needs something he goes

484
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,300
guard and it's just this little guy

485
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,100
whose eyes look this way you don't even

486
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,170
see most of his face and when he hands

487
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,370
something to someone especially if

488
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,230
they're tall his arm just slowly and

489
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,660
awkwardly reaches out and gives it to

490
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,660
them it just goes totally quiet and it's

491
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,740
so weird it's so uncomfortable I love it

492
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,540
like to me that felt like the Internet

493
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,110
like that's a lot of the Internet but

494
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,660
yeah outside of that like any kind of

495
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,210
commentary outside of the end which

496
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,360
works okay you know you know with the

497
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,340
insecurity thing against very on the

498
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,650
nose you know but it's it's not a bad

499
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,660
lesson but everything else about going

500
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,300
to like buzz tube or buzz face or face

501
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,670
buzz whatever was called it just seems

502
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,610
like stuff that not only have we seen

503
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,110
another places but we've seen in the

504
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,830
emoji movie like that's record Rashtriya

505
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,320
net to steal from the emoji movie you

506
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
know it just seems like this has been

507
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,230
done uh so yeah for me this was kind of

508
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,990
a letdown I guess I should have been

509
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,390
that surprised cuz again it is it is

510
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,250
Disney I mean think about this Disney

511
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,590
trying to tackle the Internet like this

512
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,160
is kind of destined to be very bland and

513
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,110
blase but at the same time like they

514
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,360
they tackle the Hunchback of Notre Dom

515
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,860
and I thought that was great

516
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,840
you know there's a lot of things that

517
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,340
didn't work in it but but I thought was

518
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,350
great so maybe I was thinking this would

519
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,700
be something similar like they would be

520
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,820
smart enough to jump through those you

521
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,590
know through those hoops and over those

522
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,870
hurdles you know in their own clever way

523
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,720
their own imaginative Disney way and it

524
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,270
didn't quite work for me and a lot of

525
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,500
that comes down to I just did not

526
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,680
connect with the characters journey and

527
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,860
what they were working towards I worked

528
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,840
with their connection okay for a little

529
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,120
bit you know between Ralph and Penelope

530
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,070
I thought particularly in the first like

531
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,750
dental a Miss they had a really nice

532
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,490
connection a like see him hang out and

533
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,370
going to different games and stuff but

534
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,020
that made it all the more strange when

535
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,910
you see like the break-up like in the

536
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,460
last third and like I said that really

537
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,260
out of character thing that happens in

538
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,510
the first film uh one character has to

539
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,280
do something has to like destroy this

540
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,400
car and everything has so logically

541
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,220
built up to why that character has to do

542
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,200
that and why the character felt like

543
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,740
that this was the right thing to do and

544
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,700
it's one of those things where it's like

545
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,380
yeah I know this part in the movie where

546
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,850
they kind of have to hate each other but

547
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,860
you see how that character got there and

548
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,690
this wasn't you really don't it's just

549
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,430
why don't want to see this person go so

550
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,770
I'm just going to ruin the thing they

551
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,440
love and that's just like no they're too

552
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,330
good of friends for that like they

553
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,940
understand each other more than that and

554
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,320
we had a whole movie showing that so

555
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,410
yeah that just did not that that didn't

556
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,360
that didn't connect with me it just did

557
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,010
not pull me in um but if you're just

558
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,800
looking for a little waste of time to

559
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,770
show your kids that has an okay moral

560
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,180
that I don't know especially with like

561
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,650
kids going on the Internet younger and

562
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,300
younger I mean it might not be a bad

563
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,520
thing to show them it's like yeah it's

564
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,700
fine if you watch the trailer and you

565
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,130
laughed a lot it's those kind of jokes

566
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,960
throughout the whole thing so you'll

567
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
probably dig it uh but for me I didn't

568
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,750
laugh much of the trailer and I really

569
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,310
thought the movie was gonna be better I

570
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,260
really thought it was gonna find more

571
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,380
clever ways to work with in there

572
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,660
disadvantages of being a super

573
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,120
family-friendly kid's film and yet

574
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,310
talking about the internet it but it

575
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,960
really didn't but I felt like this film

576
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,170
needed like to more solid rewrites I

577
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,850
like the ideas are there they're good

578
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,360
ideas but they just were not fleshed out

579
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,310
enough so yeah I'm really sorry I feel

580
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,220
awful because

581
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,679
love wreck-it-ralph and i films getting

582
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,320
great reviews like it slightly like

583
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,840
right now that 96% something like that

584
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,580
and it just was not sucking me in and I

585
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,380
really wanted to be sucked in by this

586
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,120
movie because I love these characters I

587
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,860
love the idea than going to the Internet

588
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,100
but I feel like I feel like the Disney

589
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,049
brand was stopping them from really

590
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:40,130
making some legit good commentary and

591
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,720
the disadvantages they had to work

592
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,539
through just shined all the more in this

593
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,280
and I feel like they really had to make

594
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,610
some sacrifices to the characters that I

595
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,510
really like to sort of tie into this

596
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,840
brand that they have to make a message

597
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
that's not a bad message but you have to

598
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,220
sacrifice a little bit of what makes the

599
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,190
characters likeable and relatable I mean

600
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,539
it's okay to not necessarily like a

601
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,740
character but you had to be able to

602
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,510
relate to them I just felt like this was

603
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,669
not relatable so I don't know I I feel

604
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:16,260
like I'm gonna be the only asshole

605
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,059
I feel like everyone else is gonna love

606
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,860
this movie they're gonna love seeing the

607
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,510
princesses all together and Penelope

608
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,730
with ralphing and having fun and making

609
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,280
poof jokes and stuff but like I don't

610
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,820
know I let me know if I'm the only a

611
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,039
hole here because I feel like I'm gonna

612
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,860
be the only one but maybe I'm not alone

613
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,470
but I feel like I'm going to but

614
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,409
nevertheless if you if you really dug it

615
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,940
and you really enjoyed it enjoy it

616
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,179
there's really nothing like harmful or

617
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,760
bad in it I mean like I said the the

618
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,270
only thing I kind of take a little bit

619
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,590
of issue with it might be a little

620
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,049
dangerous is again sort of like the how

621
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:57,570
easily the friends kind of forgive each

622
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,679
other where one friend did something

623
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,230
really bad in my opinion like the way

624
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,419
they create this world and the

625
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:04,830
environment and what this character it

626
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,049
says I think it's really friggin bad and

627
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,840
it's hard to relate with but but maybe

628
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,380
that's just me so yeah guys that's about

629
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,510
it again I'm sorry I couldn't be more

630
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,679
positive on this movie but yeah I can't

631
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,289
help what I feel man so um yeah that's

632
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,090
about it and I will talk to you guys

633
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,570
later

634
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:33,750
take care

635
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,000
you
