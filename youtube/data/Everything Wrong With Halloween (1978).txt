1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,469
huh that'll trump so carpenter was

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,700
already getting his name above the title

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,440
before we even had one hit this would be

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,670
the equivalent of M night Shyamalan

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,369
$0.06 exactly 22 days before the Kennedy

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,350
assassination coincidence

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,029
Jesus could this house look more

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,529
uninviting to trick-or-treaters the

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:23,760
Myers couldn't even bother to put the

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,170
jack-o'-lantern on the steps so people

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,519
could see it better from the street this

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,750
family came to pumpkin placement

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,130
correctly you are alone aren't we

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,570
Michael's around someplace

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,940
Michael's older sister decides I can

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,170
have sex with my boyfriend with Michael

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,579
around it's not like he'll turn into a

18
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,170
psycho killer if he sees this douchebag

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,100
pounding me I gotta go so from the time

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,960
the lights went out in Judith's bedroom

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,670
to now it's been one minute and eight

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,829
seconds and I get 20 seconds of that is

23
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,390
getting clothes off I know this kids in

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,860
high school but man I just literally

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,390
some weak sauce and not very

26
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,399
long-lasting also after the terrible sex

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,600
performance Michael's gonna kill his

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,129
sister Michael starts stabbing his

29
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,149
sister and then he turns to his right

30
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,390
and what is he stabbing the air Michael

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,250
this is a great reveal and what a fun

32
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,899
unbroken shop to start off at cheap

33
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,400
horror movie I'm removing three scenes

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,229
for this also the Myers mask is iconic

35
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,270
but can we all just admit an adult in

36
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,740
this clown costume would have been

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,780
equally creepy well day we just found

38
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,430
our son standing here with a bloody

39
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,140
butcher knife in his hand but let's just

40
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,790
stand and stare don't you think we could

41
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,490
refer to it as him

42
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,320
really Miriam just a minute ago you were

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,790
complaining about their gibberish I

44
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,050
think the expression is don't throw

45
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,580
stones at crazy people's houses or

46
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,230
something along those lines and it'd be

47
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,880
weird if this simple shot of a matchbook

48
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,950
inspired a white-trash themed reboot of

49
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,540
this series almost 30 years later thank

50
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,070
God that never happens I don't care if

51
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,540
he's from hell or not this guy doesn't

52
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,340
have the strength to open palm shatter a

53
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,500
car window like that he's gone he's gone

54
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,870
from here the evil is gone you see dr.

55
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,220
Loomis this is why nobody takes you

56
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,600
seriously you talk about Michael Myers

57
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,580
and dramatic horror movie terms you know

58
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,470
the truth so you've taken a leap nobody

59
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,120
else is ready to accept you need to

60
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
learn how to relay how evil he is

61
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,930
without calling him the evil also how

62
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,250
did you know that was Michael all you

63
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,870
saw was one of the many patients driving

64
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,340
away in the car but you never saw his

65
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,830
face also also how does Michael know how

66
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,300
to drive a car he's been in this joint

67
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,040
since he was six did they put him in the

68
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,929
student driver program don't forget to

69
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,700
drop the key off at the Myers place

70
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,560
I won't they're coming by to look at the

71
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,570
house at 10:30 this is a throwaway line

72
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,980
but brings up the question of what

73
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,930
happens to the potential homebuyers in

74
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,280
just two minutes we will see Michael's

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,900
already taken up residence as never

76
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,190
mentioned again and why wouldn't mr.

77
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,140
strode be at the house to show it hadn't

78
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,640
filled Illinois where the California

79
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,590
palms grow like wildflowers I believe

80
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,020
that's the city's motto so 15 years have

81
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,820
gone by and nobody can sell the murder

82
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,989
house why isn't this place been

83
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,459
condemned also you'd think of your

84
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,080
strode Realty you'd get somebody to at

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,580
least clean up the exterior a bit and

86
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,080
maybe do a little work inside so you

87
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,280
don't have to rely on Tom Hanks and

88
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,150
Shelley long but it should have

89
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,590
how does crazy-ass Michael Myers drive a

90
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,239
stolen station wagon through two road

91
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,620
blocks without anyone seeing it because

92
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,270
he somehow knows secret mariokart path

93
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,130
to avoid cops because remember this

94
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,959
assholes been in an institution for 15

95
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,489
years has the mind of a child

96
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:06,050
I don't care how evil he is listen here

97
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,910
dr. Loomis I already said in that I know

98
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,500
this sinning thing is a joke to you but

99
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,300
I take it goddamn seriously and so does

100
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,920
certain Hollywood directors man it'd be

101
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,140
weird if dr. Wynn who's only in this one

102
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,330
scene would show up in say the sixth

103
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,830
film in this franchise and we'd find out

104
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,970
he's a member of a weird cult that

105
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,560
worships Michael Myers thank God that

106
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,510
never happens this is a great shot and

107
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,400
I'd remove us in except how did Michael

108
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,080
know Laurie would be sitting next to a

109
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,060
window for him to stalk so perfectly so

110
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,980
why did he walk from Laurie school to

111
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,570
this kid's school Michaels business is

112
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,890
killing babysitter's so

113
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,450
is this some sort of complex dive into

114
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,160
the human soul where he sees a lot of

115
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,600
himself in the kid and he feels they

116
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
need to protect him now I'd like that

117
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,690
but that ain't the truth the truth is

118
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,430
you're the weak and I'm the tyranny of

119
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,470
evil men wait sorry guys let's go on to

120
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,910
the next sin no one will be seated

121
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,170
during the Michael goes back to the car

122
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,030
starts it and drives alongside Tommy

123
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,709
portion of the movie also if this is

124
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:52,820
supposed to be from Michael's

125
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,140
perspective then why are we looking out

126
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,459
the back window of the car while he's

127
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,170
driving Michael like most asshole

128
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,459
drivers on the road doesn't bother to

129
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,750
signal when he turns right yeah

130
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,070
Haddonfield seems like the type of

131
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,540
culturally relevant town in Illinois

132
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,880
where a sign telling you it's 73 miles

133
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,090
away would be appropriate pay phone is

134
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,910
coming to happen sale because I know him

135
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,440
what Loomis told us earlier Michael

136
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,209
hasn't spoken a word in 15 years since

137
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,890
the murder so what information did he

138
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,209
give Loomis that made him so certain

139
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,919
he'd go back there if he escaped dr.

140
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,299
Loomis conveniently pulling up to the

141
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,350
side of the road where the dead

142
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,940
motorists an abandoned truck and a phone

143
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,740
when are is convenient also how is this

144
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,330
not a crime scene by now no one saw an

145
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,560
abandoned truck on the side of the road

146
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,880
with the door wide open and thought to

147
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
check that out in the last few hours

148
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,940
Loomis knows Michael was here because of

149
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,230
the matchbook the nurse used to light

150
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,610
her cigarette but doesn't bother to

151
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,020
check for dead bodies that might have

152
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,280
been a good thing to discover and tell

153
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,660
the police earlier he could even tell

154
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,830
him that there's a sign pointing the way

155
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,479
to Haddonfield from this new murder site

156
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,310
tickets on sale for what just the high

157
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,990
school in general and who would even see

158
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,960
the sign that's practically in a forest

159
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,890
[Music]

160
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,060
Michael was literally going drive by

161
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,830
stalking speed barely faster than you

162
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,540
assholes are walking also there is no

163
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,410
way that Michael could have heard

164
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,790
anything Annie was saying while in a

165
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,870
moving car at that distance

166
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,460
I hate humor is very specific it's

167
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,870
almost like you're saying you'd like the

168
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,060
guy if he didn't own a car but still had

169
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,030
no sense of humor I've got three choices

170
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,710
watch the kids sleep listen to Linda

171
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,960
screw around to talk to you I'm starting

172
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,760
to think Myers later kills Annie to put

173
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,960
her out of her misery

174
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,510
[Music]

175
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,440
Annie was clear looking straight ahead

176
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,270
when Michael was visible so how did she

177
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,720
not see him for a movie that is so good

178
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
at elevating tension and suspense with

179
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,810
the use of atmosphere and music jump

180
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,130
scares like this come off even more

181
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,289
annoying you know siloing I guess

182
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,090
everyone's entitled one good scare and a

183
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,470
creepy adult who doesn't understand the

184
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,190
concept of personal space

185
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,270
trick-or-treating at 3:00 in the goddamn

186
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,340
afternoon even if it's like five or six

187
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,380
you are severely limiting your candy

188
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,970
haul if she's been gone all day why the

189
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,470
fuck is this window open so at this

190
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,300
point you call the cops right no okay

191
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,060
carry on rotary phone

192
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,420
wow this turns out to be Lori's friend

193
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,890
Annie who decided to call on her mouth

194
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,390
was full of cereal I didn't even bother

195
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,520
an attempt to say something Judith Miya

196
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,880
Miya Roe 18 Scott clinic during his

197
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,650
important search for Michael Myers dr.

198
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,940
Loomis decides to check out the local

199
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,830
cemetery to see if Michael defiled his

200
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,510
sister's grave which somehow takes

201
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,830
precedence over checking his old

202
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,580
neighborhood first why do they do it

203
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,260
steal tombstones that's a common

204
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,850
occurrence and Haddonfield or anywhere

205
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,310
mr. riddle was watching you Laurie mr.

206
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,770
riddle is 87 I like to think this film

207
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,080
encouraged a giant spike in 87 year old

208
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,450
men joining gyms in 1978 since they're

209
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,860
smoking weed and don't want to get

210
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,570
caught why exactly couldn't they just

211
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,010
keep talking to the sheriff

212
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,600
he's clearly busy and he could have just

213
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,740
driven right past him and he probably

214
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,270
wouldn't have even noticed all they took

215
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,700
was some Halloween mask rope and a

216
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,260
couple of knives they stole Halloween

217
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,030
masks at the hardware store

218
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,920
also what's the deal with this town

219
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,270
Michael's been able to walk around in

220
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,860
daylight all day drive around in a

221
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,570
stolen station wagon that is very easy

222
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,230
to identify

223
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,790
he stole a tombstone from a cemetery

224
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,890
committed a hardware store robbery and

225
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,240
between stops he stopped Laurie

226
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,980
throughout the movie and nobody's seen

227
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,200
this guy except Laura also also Michael

228
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,280
had the mask on when he was stalking

229
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,140
Laurie at school and afterwards when the

230
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,730
girls were walking home so has this

231
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,290
alarming going off all day one thing

232
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,600
this movie does in superb fashion and it

233
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,430
feels like nobody really ever tried this

234
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,930
in horror movies afterwards is using the

235
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,400
edges of the frame to show Michael

236
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,900
lurking around every corner this movie

237
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,370
constantly asked you to search the frame

238
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,380
for a Where's Waldo for the 70s crowd

239
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,270
and it perfectly puts the viewer on it I

240
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,620
guess we'll just chalk it up to the fact

241
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,420
that Laurie and Annie are high when they

242
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,130
don't notice the same station wagon

243
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,690
following them everywhere they go okay

244
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,190
this movie does not know how to time

245
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,660
frame correctly so Michael has

246
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,130
presumably been following Laurie around

247
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,570
all day plus he had to rob the hardware

248
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,280
store at some point steal Judith's

249
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,620
tombstone etc so let's assume he ate the

250
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,390
doll what in the morning when Laurie was

251
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,980
dropping off the key how the fuck would

252
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,070
it still be warm inside both random

253
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,360
thing that breaks a window at this very

254
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,730
moment is random and both we do he's

255
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,560
been here once tonight I think he'll

256
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,110
come back I'm gonna wait seriously this

257
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,630
podunk small town can't spare one cop to

258
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,010
help Loomis out by this point there

259
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,270
should be some sort of news about him he

260
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,830
broke out of Smith's Grove he definitely

261
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,330
murdered a guy and he's clearly back in

262
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,770
his old neighborhood but sure let's

263
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,880
dedicate our entire police force

264
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,650
elsewhere it's Halloween and somebody

265
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,120
stole a mask out of a hardware store

266
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,669
after all why do you keep them under

267
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,740
there

268
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,330
great hiding place dude your parents

269
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,770
will never find that spot under the

270
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:28,360
couch when they vacuum the living room

271
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,800
all day Laurie's been seeing a scary

272
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,599
dude staring at her at school from his

273
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,400
trademark station wagon from behind this

274
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,870
hedge and in the middle of this laundry

275
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,280
but as soon as Tommy says he sees

276
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,729
somebody

277
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,560
Laurie's lady boner over Ben tramer

278
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,510
overrides her concerned and he spills a

279
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,099
little bit of water on herself and

280
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,960
that's as good a reason as any to take

281
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,820
off both shirts and her pants in the

282
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,930
middle of the kitchen with open windows

283
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,830
all around mind

284
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,300
that was clearly a whimper and not a

285
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,070
sound that would make anyone think a dog

286
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,540
was okay and he might be a bigger dick

287
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,310
to dogs than Michael and he kills them

288
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,200
and eats them for sake I get that John

289
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,700
Carpenter loves him some of the thing

290
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,470
but do we have to watch all 30 seconds

291
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,820
at the opening I mean that's a 30

292
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,560
seconds of logos sin in a movie within a

293
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,850
movie Jesus huh long as this night also

294
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,020
they're making a jack-o'-lantern on

295
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,280
Halloween night what will they do with

296
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,810
it afterwards put it out on November

297
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,220
first think through your activities

298
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,820
Laurie come on I saw the boogeyman I saw

299
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,770
him outside Laurie's disbelief a sign

300
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,720
which is bull by the way this is what

301
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,250
Tommy saw he saw a dark figure standing

302
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,990
out on alone that literally could be

303
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,220
anyone but because he's a kid that

304
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,900
nobody believes he's absolutely right

305
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,690
about this

306
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,090
that Michael also have ninja training at

307
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,590
the institution because he moves so

308
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:49,030
stealthily he doesn't even make a sound

309
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,350
Lindsay why don't we not stand here

310
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,030
talking about them then get down to

311
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,800
doing that man Michael Myers hit the

312
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,390
jackpot with how many babysitters when

313
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,650
he decided to come back to Haddonfield

314
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,090
on Halloween night which brings up the

315
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,560
question how did he know who all the

316
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,910
babysitter's were when he came back how

317
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,560
did he choose these victims he's been

318
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,240
planning this all day and it's not like

319
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,680
he knows the babysitting situation in

320
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,270
this town

321
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,460
butter all over my closet am I seeing

322
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,200
things or did she simply spill water on

323
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,510
her clothes and it was just a little bit

324
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,430
like even if that was butter it wasn't

325
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,080
all over her clothes like she claims

326
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,440
[Music]

327
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,220
sure you might have thought the door was

328
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,810
open but how are you going to operate

329
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,340
the car without your keys you went

330
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,870
straight to the car we're not looking

331
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,490
for your purse how damp for Paul do you

332
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,560
have to be to forget keys wait a minute

333
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,120
didn't Michael have a copy of the key or

334
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
does he know how to use a murder knife

335
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,110
to break into cars and man and he didn't

336
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,270
even notice Paul must be the best what

337
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,560
the hell was Michael doing in this car

338
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,180
for the last 30 seconds to fog up the

339
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,620
windows like that actually scratch that

340
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm okay not knowing the answer there's

341
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,190
no blood coming from her throat so what

342
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,140
exactly did he just slice that her ear

343
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,970
also what's the best way to emot-- a

344
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,010
horrible death probably not this Tommy

345
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,630
picks the most insane moment to play a

346
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,250
trick on Lindsay as it's perfect time

347
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,510
he's seen Michael carrying Andy's

348
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,430
lifeless body into the house next door

349
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,750
Loomis gets his saved a kid from murder

350
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,460
Boy Scout badge today and if you are

351
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,940
right what story did Loomis tell the

352
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,530
sheriff about Michael's escape how did

353
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,000
that story turned into Loomis being the

354
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,980
party responsible for first I rip your

355
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,720
clothes off then you rip my clothes off

356
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,580
then we rip Lindsay's clothes off I was

357
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,230
told that 10 years later this guy was

358
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,610
fired from the guardians of the galaxy

359
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,490
franchise yeah but Lindsay's parents

360
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,230
have to come home at some point right

361
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,420
Jesus this might be the least sexy seen

362
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,430
since disclosure but also some pretty

363
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,720
good representation of high school sex

364
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,790
also based on where Linda's leg is and

365
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,260
the direction Bob is thrusting it would

366
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,880
appear that Linda's thigh will be

367
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,620
reaching orgasm in just a few seconds

368
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,110
also also why is there a lit up pumpkin

369
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,370
in this bedroom did they come up here

370
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,780
and light up this jack-o'-lantern or did

371
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,770
somebody else do it and it's been

372
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,360
sitting here for hours based on the

373
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,860
actions of doors in this film I think

374
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,450
it's safe to say scream 3 and how will

375
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,600
we in take place in the same universe

376
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,370
come on out so Michael watch them have

377
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,350
sex then came down here and hid in the

378
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,150
closet just in case Bob checked it do I

379
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,500
have that right because I'm gonna head

380
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,030
up Michael Myers for gambling advice

381
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,800
later if that's true I admit this knife

382
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,810
is huge but how Allah does it go through

383
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,760
Bop body and into the door behind him

384
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,930
having enough strength to keep him

385
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,010
suspended in the air after the

386
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,690
investigation is over the hardware store

387
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,040
Michael stole this knife Ron should be

388
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,690
using this in their advertising I love

389
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,280
this iconic look of Michael cocking his

390
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,780
head side to side when he looks at dead

391
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,460
Bob he's either admiring his own work or

392
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,690
wrapped up in the beauty of what he did

393
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,220
I'll take us in off for it listen off

394
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,940
for murder I mean don't you ever tell me

395
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,710
that this guy while as evil as dr.

396
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,180
Loomis says he is doesn't have a sense

397
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,040
of humor and since he also has a car and

398
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,510
he would love this guy if she was still

399
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,140
what this mother never looked for the

400
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,180
car before this all so how is it even

401
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,950
here we know that Michael parked the car

402
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,570
in front of Tommy Doyle's house even

403
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,680
though we haven't seen it again until

404
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,540
now and the Myers house is not across

405
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,770
the street from the Doyle residence

406
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,360
where exactly did Michael have that

407
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,070
tombstone stash this whole time also

408
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,960
also remember when Michael took Annie's

409
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,550
body into the house he had to have been

410
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,380
setting this up then and he had no idea

411
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,790
Linda and Bob would be showing up but

412
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,020
when he saw them later did he go back

413
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,700
upstairs hi Danny's body and wait to

414
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,990
kill them before setting it all back up

415
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,210
I mean where was this guy stored so that

416
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,560
this could happen what the busy hanging

417
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,030
from and why didn't Michael just leave

418
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,070
him stuck on the pantry door Jesus what

419
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,570
is up with these doors opening on their

420
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,100
own did the slasher killers only case

421
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,460
houses with automatic doors so we get

422
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,660
the fuck out of the house right this

423
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,339
guy's a top notch fortune teller slash

424
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,350
knife expert on the cutting edge of

425
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,880
blade technology and he takes a poor

426
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,680
stab at slicing the sharp heroine of the

427
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,320
movie also she just broke a leg on both

428
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,300
there is dead right no okay

429
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,100
carry on Michael somehow knew to use a

430
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,260
rake to prevent Laurie from going out

431
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,910
this door like he knew it would come to

432
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,350
this he didn't do this with any of the

433
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,880
other victims Laurie's the one he

434
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,110
figured would be the most likely to

435
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,180
escape man people are super talented in

436
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,740
the Halloween verse at breaking windows

437
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,510
with their bare hands I'd send this for

438
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,980
the obvious heroine Falls my running

439
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,570
cliche except I'm still flabbergasted

440
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,400
that she can move at all after falling

441
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,620
down those stairs what the actual was

442
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,770
this guy waiting for the whole time I

443
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,390
mean did Michael ever have the chance to

444
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,740
cut the phone line he's been at the

445
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,450
other house this whole time and he was

446
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,589
just about to catch up to Laurie about

447
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,240
five seconds ago so in the time

448
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,740
Laurie walked in here he cut the phone

449
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,930
line and apparently broke this window to

450
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,060
get into the house I mean this reveal is

451
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,630
a lie

452
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,120
had no chance to do this and even if he

453
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,069
did why did he wait for Laurie to around

454
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:11,540
with the phone and before trying to kill

455
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,370
her really feel like Laurie not saying

456
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,740
so this is she stabs him was a missed

457
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,149
opportunity I'm surprised there isn't

458
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,740
already a rake propped up against this

459
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,360
upstairs bedroom door so that Laurie

460
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,319
can't turn that off

461
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,420
stab him in the face although you're

462
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,279
right it probably doesn't matter no one

463
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,350
shoots a horror movie like carpenter so

464
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,980
let's review

465
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,240
Michael was stabbed by a coat hanger

466
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,190
stamped with a knife shot four times and

467
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,720
fell out of the top floor of a house and

468
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
he's still a lot this guy did come from

469
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,350
two human parents right well maybe not

470
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,089
now that I reflect on it since Michael

471
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,560
killed Judith at the age of six and

472
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,389
escaped 15 years later shouldn't this

473
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,519
read Michael age 21 movie doesn't know

474
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,959
how to math or credits I blame the

475
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,410
chicken you love movies you know you do

476
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,850
otherwise you wouldn't be watching a

477
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,170
channel that pretends to hate movies

478
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,060
made by people who love movies I don't

479
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,630
know what that means

480
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,949
