to cheer me up okay I guess I'll do a

23
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
review and this was pretty simple I'm

24
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,150
pretty short because Detroit become

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,150
human is barely even a game at all I

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,510
mean its gameplay consists of move your

27
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,450
controller like this or like this or

28
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:44,260
like this what's you serve riveting they

29
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,890
weigh it out just play it out suspense

30
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,890
is killing just what I thought

31
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,400
eggs and bacon you have to set your

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,220
expectations right at the beginning it's

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,280
controls are sometimes wonky and there's

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,680
a ton of frustrating invisible walls to

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,359
contend with visible well fuck fuckin

36
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:13,240

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,660
ridiculously arbitrary tasks they're

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,530

now this is my first David cage game

54
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,580
from what is it Quantic Dream's you see

55
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,390
Detroit is simply an interactive movie

56
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,830
without much of the actual interaction

57
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,230
outside of important choices of the lead

58
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,810
to branching paths the story is told

59
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,420
through three main protagonists we got

60
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,480
Cara who's helping Alice escape this

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,990
domestic abuse and a broken home her

62
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,630
story really managed to grip me and

63
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,880
invest me not only in Alice this little

64
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,590
girl but you know who you're trying to

65
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,740
save but also Cara herself as she comes

66
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,770
to terms with humanity Starks side you

67
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:31,770

damn it Joe

72

then there's one of the weakest ones at

73
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,500
least in my opinion is Marcus now his

74
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,600
story it just has some pacing problems

75
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,670
at the beginning and some really bad

76
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,250
levels where you're playing the lame-ass

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,740
game play over and over one too many

times wow this is excessive

Debu Marcus do something

meet up with and start to lead this

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,180
too but finally there's my favorite

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:29,200
character Connor the second he realized

85
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,030
I lied to him I had to take about you

and I ruined the men's game and there

129
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,630
was at one point where my inaction led

130
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,270
to Connors death and I was freakin

131
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,060
devastated calm down don't be difficult

you only make things harder

133

I told you do my favorite character

134
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,950
you forget of his size Bob get up and

135
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,960
surely I was the one that wasn't the

136
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,360
point that I wanted to press anyway I

137
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,270
pressed the wrong button the last time I

138
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,300
didn't press any button there so I was

139
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
supply told you to intervene you said

140
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
I'm not gonna intervene I don't want to

141
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,910
gonna press nothing that's what I want

142
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,740
that one that's nothing you should end

143
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,820
it and look what happen

144
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,190
you didn't intervene so I lost my

145
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,740
favorite character I don't place know me

146
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,270
maybe we could fix him he is an Android

147
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:10,760
right we can fix him chat but don't give

148
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,750
up trust me the game continues like life

149
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,110
and it's those kinds of things that can

150
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,870
happen in this game that really invests

151
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,930
you in the world the the mocap is really

152
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,960
good the facial animation is very

153
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,650
realistic the artists have created a

154
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,900
fantastic world here they really deserve

155
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,660
to be commended also really liked the

156
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,840
music choice and how this is near future

157
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,630
it's not you know really far in the

158
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,760
future with you know flying police cars

159
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
but it's somewhat realistic

162
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,980
live in a future like this I want I want

163
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:04,600
like hotdogs and the fact that yes any

164
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,270
one of the main characters can die and

165
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,840
that's what this game does so well that

166
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,750
that even the mundane to tes that have

167
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,600
no purpose in other games are way more

168

tension-filled and important here oh

169
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:28,910
fuck I missed

170
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:41,330
ah kill counter again I bite your gunner

171
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,600
yeah you don't want to fail that any of

172
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,670
them when you actually care about the

173
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,650
characters that you're playing but if

174
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,410
you do fail at them interesting results

175
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,590
can still happen at the end of each one

176
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,810
of the levels you are shown a branching

177
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,300
tree result of all the choices that you

178
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,210
made and all the possible paths that you

179
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,900
could have che taken and some levels are

180
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,960
massive while others are far more linear

181
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,060
and restrictive but still it's very

182
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,700
interesting to see how many people ended

183
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,940
up doing your particular path and me and

184
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,680
other Joe we ended up going against the

185
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,010
grain

186
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,860
pretty much dramatically with like

187
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,550
choices in the single digits at times

188
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,820
reach the fence too late zero percent of

189
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,560
people did it yeah that's how you

190
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,900
fucking do it

one number one in the world Cara and

ain't never seen you ain't never seen

195
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,010
and yes you can save scum by going to

196
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,320
the main menu at any point and then

197
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,510
going to your specific chapter and then

198
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,100
beginning it again or choosing a

199
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,100
specific point in that story within that

200
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,440
chapter and playing from there but half

201
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,780
of the fun is seeing what your choices

202
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,140
will ultimately result in and I tested

203
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,020
it there are ultimately so many outcomes

204
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,060
for each one of the three main

205
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,360
storylines like 5 to 7 different results

206
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,910
for each I mean you could sometimes even

207
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,550
fail these so hard especially if you're

208
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,350
doing it on purpose that the game

209
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,360
doesn't even know how to react to your

210
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,490
stupidity

211
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,040
you let Cara and

212
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,470
dai how could you do that you could have

213
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:48,040
saved them remember the lives of these

216
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:17,590
I detect a malfunction in my program

217
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,080
this is worrying when you see a little

218
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,050
yellow bit on the branching path that'll

219
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,360
mean that whatever you picked there will

220
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,550
come into play later on it's these

221
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,300
crossovers into future chapters some may

222
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,880
save your life others may end the life

223
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,700
of one of your companions early who

224
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,280
won't make it to the end and it's all

225
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,830
really cool and these three stories do

226
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,800
end up sort of crossing paths and that's

227
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,870
really interesting but let me tell you

228
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,700
there are some endings that are really

229
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,740
gonna feel like shit and I understand

230
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,150
why there's some low scores out there

231
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,470
cuz it could really piss you off

232
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:05,760
nice paid extra for 95

gonna get this one killed it got an

237
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,000
emotional reaction out of me and the

holiday there was one you know were in

that moment I was watching the screen

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,830
and then something flew into my eye and

241
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,390
yeah

heartless words you gotta be tough

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,530
that's hard choice obsessive it is it's

249
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,350
kind of the game is manipulative yes but

250
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,840
it's effective and any game that can get

251
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,120
these kinds of reactions from you that's

252
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,100
one that's worth playing in my book

253
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,980
so yes it's barely a game and it's more

254
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,100
like a movie a choose-your-own-adventure

255
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,320
movie and from what I've heard it's the

256
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,720
best of the David cage interactive

257
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,530
stories with obvious parallels with real

258
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,250
life but important parallels that some

259
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,320
people may roll their eyes at but we

260
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,330
must all come to terms with and decide

261
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,160
you know how we feel about some of these

262
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,140
issues that are facing others in this

263
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,210
game sort of does that it's a story

264
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,030
about what's happening now rather than

265
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,770
what's happening with the androids in

266
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,870
the future but you know what it can

267
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,180
really apply to that too when we get

268
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,500
these things in the future

269
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,750
that's good sci-fi that this sort of

270
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,630
based in realism and one whose world can

271
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,790
go from moments that are really

272
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,280
idealistic and optimistic to really

273
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,890
horrific and dark straight out of a

274
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,140
horror movie this games got that it's a

275
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,250
game that I think you should all

276
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,480
experience however I must say because

277
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,910
there's some little actual gameplay and

278
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,340
because it's basically like a 14 hour

279
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,040
long movie or no veteran or TV series I

280
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,890
just don't think it's quite worth the

281
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,520
$60 asking price upfront you know

282
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,890
especially with your mileage varying on

283
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,510
the game with your choices it could

284
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,700
salary your experience mine was really

285
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,040
awesome but yours my suck sure you can

286
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,300
go through it again but it won't

287
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,610
certainly still have that same impact in

288
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,740
that second playthrough that fake

289
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,080
playthrough like I I was hoping it would

290
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,660
so my advice to you is if you haven't

291
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,510
got this one already definitely

292
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,840
so when it goes on sale so the final

293
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,970
verdict for Detroit become human it's

294
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,360
gonna be a seven out of ten for me this

295
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,360
is the best a game like this could ever

296
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,910
achieve unless they actually start

297
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,450
including some engaging gameplay

298
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,130
segments even if it's the ones that are

299
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,020
found in what is that quantum dream game

300
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:30,830
than me and OJ played oh no I meant I

301
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,080
meant quantum breaking come on of dreams

302
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,720
let us take control of the character

303
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,600
during battles and gunplay get rid of

304
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,760
some of the invisible walls or at least

305
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,980
smartly hide them better and you're

306
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,810
gonna have something that transcends

307
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,450
both genres easily capable of a

308
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,210
legendary rating will they ever do this

309
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,940
I don't know well David caves evolve

310
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,130
this formula more this is the third game

311
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,160
I guess we're just gonna have to wait

312
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
and see until then I'll see you guys on

313
