[Music]

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,050
seriously how long do you think they'll

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,519
wait before they put a replica of the

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,840
castle from the Magic Kingdom right

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,549
between the two and the zero Jesus

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,900
Christ if you're gonna subvert something

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,880
maybe try working on these 36 seconds of

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,189
logos hang on this is ultimately a

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,960
pretty apartment right but there's a

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,970
six-burner stove that's like chef

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,560
quality also if he's trying to get a

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,539
bunch of gas in here why didn't dpe turn

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,340
on a last burner on the end and now the

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,260
pink stove controls are turned every

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,489
which way rather than being on the

16
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,290
maximum effort setting we just saw

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,090
Deadpool put them on my point in is why

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,440
can't this movie fucking stove correctly

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,670
just because you're a Deadpool movie

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,829
doesn't get you out of a showing a love

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,719
story through a photo collage montage

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,350
cliche sit Wolverine sitting Deadpool

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,610
for narration is like sending

24
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,930
chocolate-chip cookies because they

25
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,219
contain chocolate chips but I actually

26
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,719
prefer a chocolate chip list chocolate

27
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,219
chip cookies and we've got a job to do

28
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,820
here so narration yes what will be I'm

29
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,129
dying in this one too yeah but not

30
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,989
really you're asking for an emotional

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,789
payoff for multiple fake out deaths in

32
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,080
this movie at least Logan had the

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,309
decency to stay deceased

34
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,020
I don't speak Cantonese mr. funny joke

35
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,360
but did Deadpool seriously come all the

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,040
way to Hong Kong without knowing this

37
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,720
motherfuckers name what kind of plan was

38
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,159
this and how long was he waiting in

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,540
there is this really more effective than

40
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,220
say jumping out from behind a tree or

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,869
was Ryan just longing to relive his time

42
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,759
on the Buried set see Captain America

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
yeah dude there are some great King

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,060
shout outs to other superheroes in

45
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,159
multiple universes but doesn't this one

46
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,170
feel forced like other than spraying the

47
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,240
funeral with bullets couldn't cap do all

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,369
the Deadpool's doing here sure we are

49
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,200
far enough away to not see that it's

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,970
Wade doing some Deadpool dancing why are

51
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,130
these guys right up front still cheering

52
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,600
like they think it's Demi Moore from 20

53
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,110
years ago

54
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,610
aside from the fact that these Jacuzzi

55
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,380
Yakuza have caught a bad case of one at

56
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,850
a time I just why doesn't a single one

57
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,930
of them have a gun on them no one

58
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,520
thought to bring it to koozie Uzi also

59
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,229
despite that I've got to give it up for

60
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,939
the fight choreography in this movie

61
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,979
Jesus who even thinks up fights like

62
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,960
this dozens of severed arms legs and

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,820
heads but yes please blur this man's

64
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,439
giggle stick because who will think of

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:01,860
the children

66
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,060
that babysitter of yours is high as damn

67
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,500
I like to party I know we want to see

68
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,179
all the back good action behind him but

69
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,500
how is this asshole supposedly running

70
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,270
at top speed when the stuff behind him

71
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,170
is happening in real time

72
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,800
little pokey can't maintain address and

73
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,390
thus begins the annoying trend of the

74
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,890
exact same beat from the first movie

75
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,510
happening in the sequel remember when I

76
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,020
couldn't have fun food and Deadpool to

77
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,850
expects us to remember the dopinder

78
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,709
F story from the last movie look I've

79
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,390
seen the first Deadpool dozens of times

80
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,670
and even I forgot that pattern yet who

81
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,440
have those dreams grabbed those dreams

82
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,560
by the tip and make it rain I don't know

83
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,790
what that means I don't know what that

84
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,110
means there's a cheap and easy beat in

85
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,150
the comedy movie cliche diarrhea we

86
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,350
can't be sure till I get the suit off

87
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,070
but all signs point to yes and Deadpool

88
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,510
movies have as many poop jokes as a

89
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,220
goddamn Shrek movie and I'm sending that

90
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,959
crap number one it totally taints this

91
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,730
franchise and is a stain on the logo

92
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,320
rheic nature of the dialogue and number

93
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,970
two it wipes clean any of the goodwill

94
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,530
from the more intelligent humor might

95
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,330
want to dump on us later baby factory's

96
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,820
open for business oh my god oh that's

97
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,440
sweet but like most superheroes that

98
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,060
choose to procreate you got to wonder

99
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,560
about some things like how much

100
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,600
Deadpool's mutilated DNA would affect a

101
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:09,959
fetus

102
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,310
see ok with potentially having offspring

103
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,930
that is impervious to death does he even

104
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,670
have sperm that could fertile oh wait

105
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,900
this totally means but nothing's gonna

106
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,250
die so we won't have to think any

107
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,290
further about this you are not your

108
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,549
father I know we're trying to squeeze

109
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,260
some substance into this sequel but it's

110
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,340
just really what we're here for

111
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,750
if Deadpool knows he's in a movie he

112
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,220
should know that she's about to bite it

113
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,530
right wait Deadpool somehow develop

114
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,730
spidey sense sort of Morgan Freeman

115
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,260
trained him to do this by getting his

116
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,030
ass kicked by Angelina Jolie considering

117
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,470
Deadpool is extremely aware of his

118
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,940
inability to die wouldn't he'd do

119
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,650
everything he can to push this fight out

120
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,239
into the hallway to protect someone he

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,829
knows is vulnerable instead of you know

122
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,780
diving across a counter and ducking out

123
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,100
a sight to give them more time to shoot

124
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,440
up the place okay since this moment sets

125
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,090
the entire plot in motion let's break it

126
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,829
down show me first even beyond the

127
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,150
character says I'm okay but then

128
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,590
surprise they are an okay cliche

129
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,030
why is this final gunman waiting so long

130
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,890
let's see a big Deadpool fanboy and just

131
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,239
couldn't attack until he heard a good

132
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,290
cheese spreader joke

133
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,239
second Deadpool has time to recognize

134
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,769
the look on her face completely turn

135
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,000
around and throw the spreader but

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,380
discount Inara doesn't have time to

137
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,299
quickly drop to the floor third wade has

138
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,950
wrapped up each previous baddie in the

139
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,930
scuffle with inhumanely accurate knife

140
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,430
throwing skills but here he not only

141
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,930
misses the vital organs he completely

142
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,329
misses the entire person and force where

143
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,680
if I see one more person turn their head

144
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,209
and follow a slow-mo bullet in the movie

145
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,620
I will force-feed the entirety of

146
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,450
Hollywood toaster strudels with Manny's

147
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,580
icing totally Sergei went

148
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,319
exactly where Deadpool guests like he

149
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,490
could have hidden in the hallway for a

150
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,379
while and scape easily do we have to do

151
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,580
these credits with all the in jokes

152
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,169
again isn't the bomb parity and the

153
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,120
genuinely good Celine Dion song enough

154
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
it's like saying narration or roll

155
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,710
credits or logos man in every video wait

156
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,319
you smell like sauerkraut left in the

157
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,069
warm rain

158
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,659
this goes on for some time and gets

159
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,400
progressively less funny just trust me

160
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,990
are you pissing are you urinating right

161
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,159
now you're making the face that you make

162
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:50,939
me your name hi

163
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:52,439
lowest-common-denominator

164
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,000
I'd like to place an order for one piss

165
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,659
joke for Deadpool - sure hope they're

166
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,860
tied up in a complicated deal with the

167
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,690
despicable me franchise I thought you

168
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,150
saw me with your ears man it's hard to

169
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,740
overstate how these movies would be if

170
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,360
anyone other than Ryan Reynolds was

171
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,919
playing this character I'm conflicted on

172
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,330
whether this qualifies as a sin yeah

173
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,400
this movie rips off Groundhog Day even

174
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,289
worse than happy deathday also until he

175
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,580
gets to the gasoline trick in the

176
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,500
apartment how that would wait expect any

177
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,789
of this crap to kill him he's clearly

178
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,830
survived much worse so this is really

179
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,330
just for the audience hey it looks like

180
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,430
Wade made it to the upside down there's

181
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,740
something here I can't take it - are we

182
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,090
really supposed to buy into this emotion

183
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,379
you can't spend three minutes asking me

184
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,759
to take you seriously and the rest of

185
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,199
the time making dick infer jokes while

186
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,669
breaking every fourth wall in sight he

187
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,650
says self-referential II I feel like the

188
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,479
writers used all their supply of villain

189
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,849
nuance on cable and said get to the rest

190
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,710
of the bad guys so is there the same

191
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,240
fight between humans and mutants in this

192
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,620
universe as there is in the x-men

193
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,240
universe seems like Deadpool and the

194
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,620
other mutants are able to operate with

195
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,300
impunity with no resistance from humans

196
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,129
but here they drop us into a mutant

197
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,479
conversion facility with barely a

198
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,520
mention of the underlying politics some

199
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,310
ground rules well under our roof number

200
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,080
one but Colossus has the handbook

201
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,430
halfway open did they seriously wait

202
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,779
until the goddamn middle of the book to

203
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,219
start talking about the rules also

204
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,870
pretty sure Colossus would have the

205
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,310
rules memorized by this point especially

206
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,589
you know the first one about not killing

207
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:10,979
anyone

208
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,259
I said how long has Wade been here he's

209
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,669
just now getting introduced to the rules

210
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,250
and meeting ntw and ukyo for the first

211
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,779
time but he's super well healed after

212
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,849
having been blown all the way up doesn't

213
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,500
that take a long time to reverse and how

214
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,969
does he even heal I've never seen his

215
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,770
parts reattached before they just grow

216
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,750
back so did this body eventually sprout

217
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,979
from his head I'm just saying the whole

218
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,569
aftermath of the catastrophic suicide

219
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,669
attempt is way yada-yada seer hilarious

220
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,770
bit truly a laugh-out-loud moment but

221
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,870
why what are the x-men doing in there I

222
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,219
couldn't lead here or see them before

223
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,389
that why wouldn't they want to talk to

224
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,410
wait anyway

225
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,020
yes who killed Vanessa car away he means

226
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,270
himself so this is really just a slight

227
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,040
modification of the pronoun game and you

228
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,330
know how we feel about that around here

229
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,340
I'm gonna tell you what the big lie is

230
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,650
toilet paper geez between this

231
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,020
interstellar thor ragnarok unsane the

232
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,820
third wheel and team america it's clear

233
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,500
that Matt Damon would rather cameo for

234
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,910
the rest of his career than trained for

235
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,620
another fuckin Bourne movie the PFAs

236
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,390
colossus doing calisthenics for this is

237
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,890
metallic shape really require cardio

238
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,880
something wrong it's fine just filled it

239
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,980
so this implies weighed literally jerked

240
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,720
off into the soap dispenser right is

241
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,980
that the joke and why would colossus

242
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,900
even use soap and water anyway god this

243
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,220
movie definitely decided to go with

244
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,780
quantity over quality for the jokes

245
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,190
that's a terrible idea

246
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,530
I'm really not ready it Swedes plan here

247
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,150
I know he's faking like he's found some

248
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,650
heart and he's playing by the rules of

249
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,090
the mansion but is he really content

250
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,320
with sitting around the house I thought

251
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,850
he wanted to be involved this kid needs

252
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,500
to be the icebox not here

253
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,780
Russell Provence in our care man this

254
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,280
sure is a casual conversation to be

255
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,690
having while only several feet away from

256
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,580
an out-of-control fire throwing mutant

257
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,770
sure rustles in a temper tantrum but why

258
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,270
is he taking it out on the x-men they're

259
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,380
the only ones that are actually trying

260
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,910
to talk to it and they're clearly one of

261
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,440
his own despite the other two going

262
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,760
straight backwards as a result of

263
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,260
Russell's fireball Deadpool somehow

264
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,030
curves up into this window just so we

265
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,680
can get a super force Wolverine Ryan

266
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,380
Reynolds Joe it's the perfect way for

267
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,820
Deadpool did not cross all out of the

268
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,620
picture and is a beautiful shot holy

269
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,000
that's awesome so the human police have

270
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,980
collar restraints for the mutants like

271
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,510
once they get that technology and if

272
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,740
it's available why the hell is the

273
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,780
headmaster using that throat device that

274
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,000
clearly doesn't work you let me down

275
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,670
the last time Jesus can we give Colossus

276
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,170
anything else to do except try and fail

277
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,120
to rehabilitate wait this is like the

278
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,980
least efficient prison ever made why

279
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,420
have the cells so far apart why is there

280
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,530
so much room it's not like they need to

281
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,210
mitigate any mutant powers that's what

282
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,920
the suddenly convenient hours are for my

283
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,530
whole life I've been waiting for someone

284
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,360
to come and save me know what he's gonna

285
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,340
sacrifice anything for me sacré

286
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,080
foreshadowing also this underscores my

287
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,219
question about Russell's behavior

288
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,840
outside the school there were actual

289
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,310
superheroes there trying to help him and

290
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,690
they were the only ones he unleashed on

291
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,099
I'm just saying that if he has this much

292
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,690
insight he'd be able to recognize an

293
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,349
opportunity

294
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,540
nothing worse than afraid to go wait guy

295
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,040
in case you missed the allegory about

296
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,839
the mutant rehabilitation Wade's here to

297
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,310
properly smash you over the head with it

298
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,060
I've got tumors

299
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,400
Vanessa's weights so his way planning on

300
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,470
just dying or getting his heart right

301
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,120
before he does because I thought that

302
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,440
was the whole point of the sanctimonious

303
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
house mom routine before this whole

304
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,300
mission

305
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,790
nice to see some fresh faces of yeah

306
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,680
yeah and what's up with that even though

307
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,210
they were arrested at the same place why

308
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,010
did Wade and Russell end up in the exact

309
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,390
same set he's only 14

310
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,560
don't they have a juvenile block at the

311
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,600
icebox wait they were just in a full-on

312
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
prison fight and all they got was sent

313
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
back to their fairly plush cell I mean

314
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,070
him aside from the rampant bullying and

315
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,570
the unhygenic conditions there's been a

316
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,580
bad place to stay sure makes a nice

317
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,320
symbolic touchstone for us but how

318
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,850
exactly did Deadpool manage to bring

319
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,770
this token sentimental token token in

320
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,220
with it

321
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,750
token Dan once you get inside this

322
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,250
prison apparently you can go anywhere

323
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,720
guys I'm pretty sure that movie's

324
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,310
telling us that cable killed this guy by

325
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,910
breaking the fuck out of his arm yeah

326
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,040
but the doors literally just opened four

327
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,810
seconds before this blast so why are

328
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,490
both of you all survived Ian stopped

329
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,320
convenient easily short-circuited power

330
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,300
cancelling necklace is convenient from

331
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,040
the future I have three questions then

332
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,850
what dan when was a script written it

333
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,500
hasn't really been popular since 2011

334
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,330
I'm pretty sure the last few minutes of

335
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,190
this action sequence qualifies it as our

336
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,750
mutilation porn and there's a good

337
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,070
chance that it was secretly directed by

338
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,790
David Cronenberg

339
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,950
oh no Wade has been injured they totally

340
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,390
care about this because he's never gonna

341
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,280
recover also cables been spending all

342
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,810
this time on beating up Wade when his

343
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,980
primary mission is currently

344
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,480
incapacitated and standing in the

345
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
adjacent prison wait how did wait almost

346
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,990
died again he just hit his head on a

347
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,400
rock and fell into a lake which is

348
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,990
really no worse than all the cable did

349
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,830
to him back at the prison

350
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,120
damn it literally one of the rules that

351
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
word selfless a leader they don't know

352
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,810
what that means means just like the

353
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,370
third I don't know what that means joke

354
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,750
in the movie and it just keeps getting

355
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,730
dumber yeah so after that big fight I

356
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,200
guess everyone escaped the frosty

357
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,790
mountain landscape and went back to

358
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,470
their corners Wade went back to the bar

359
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,780
cable back to his hotel room he had

360
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,830
already broken into the prison and

361
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,240
everything up I didn't he go back and

362
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,890
finish the job he was right there and

363
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,560
like that's not a superpower yeah notice

364
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,120
lead dismissal of this becomes a running

365
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,160
joke but is it that crazy of a notion

366
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,420
especially compared to all the others

367
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,980
they're seeing today everything usually

368
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,930
just kind of works out for me like 2008

369
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,330
Ryan Reynolds is god damn it this is

370
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,830
getting congrates

371
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,780
also there's so many medow Ryan Reynolds

372
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,950
jokes in this movie that I'm about to

373
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,330
overdose it made sense in the first

374
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,590
movie there's a really good one at the

375
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,940
end of this movie but we get it

376
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,470
self-deprecating made some terrible

377
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,060
movies Renaissance with this character

378
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,560
can we move on

379
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,270
we interrupt this Deadpool movie to

380
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,370
bring you Conair to cruise control

381
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:17,200
disease dramatic but no one in the movie

382
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,910
is gonna point out the obvious Star Wars

383
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,290
ripoff they call Colossus on that

384
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,260
Robocop baby why is the mutant that

385
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,940
spits acid wearing a guard that would

386
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,930
keep him from doing so

387
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,850
I mean I know Cyclops has his special

388
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,530
glasses but that's because his gazer

389
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,970
beams are always on and need to be

390
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,350
contained but considering this guy

391
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,510
hasn't even spit acid once I'm not sure

392
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,530
what that's supposed to do for anyone

393
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,170
this scene is amazing and you can bet

394
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,370
your happy ass I'm gonna be taking some

395
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,380
sins off for it but I do have to knock

396
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,240
it a bit for the using a CDC's

397
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,440
thunderstruck in an action sequence

398
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,330
cliche not to mention that only Domino

399
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,980
actually uses her ability to stop her

400
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,960
from dying no one else even tries like

401
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,790
couldn't bedlam somehow manipulate the

402
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,530
electricity around him too anyway you

403
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,880
see where I'm going and for that I'm

404
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,950
only going to remove three sets also the

405
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,280
scene is seriously when it was a script

406
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,510
written a lot of these jokes feel as

407
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,340
stale as TJ Miller's career just ask my

408
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,660
own joke about it we've already seen you

409
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,160
behead and dismember multiple enemies

410
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,570
with all sorts of copious amounts of

411
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,980
hemoglobin spatter are we really

412
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,360
supposed to believe that becoming queasy

413
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,770
is even an option for you at this point

414
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,870
yes it makes for good cinema but why the

415
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,490
put the prison-transport the most

416
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,170
dangerous mutants in the world straight

417
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,070
through the middle of a major

418
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,380
metropolitan area oh yeah wearing the

419
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,120
hood made you totally incognito to

420
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,380
anyone you passed on the street

421
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,230
another amazingly constructed scene uh I

422
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,670
ain't takin sins off for this one since

423
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,470
Domino has already killed dozens of

424
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,880
likely in to suffice Sanders in this

425
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,830
scene along discount Hulk also is this

426
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,390
really the most efficient drop-in for

427
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,770
cable domain Mike wouldn't it be easier

428
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,420
to pick a shorter building just be on

429
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,950
the ground waiting for the convoy he

430
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,120
ends up running after them on the street

431
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,370
anyway

432
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,870
[Music]

433
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,940
even in a movie this ludicrous this

434
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,830
works dan any more of these shots and

435
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm gonna have to formally introduce a

436
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,950
Deadpool gets hilariously maimed by a

437
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,710
speeding vehicle please

438
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,540
does anyone else think the cable is

439
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,950
extremely via this job

440
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,630
I mean his sole focus has been to kill

441
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,890
Russell but he keeps fiddle farting

442
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,540
around with secondary characters and

443
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,910
stupid one-liners wait convict

444
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,680
containers aren't bulletproof and why

445
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,820
aren't they already riddled with gun

446
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,020
shots considering the amount of

447
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,310
ammunition that has been unloaded

448
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,020
already in this truck why is this even

449
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,700
possible and have we seen anything in

450
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,320
our time with peewee Kiwi here to think

451
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,340
that he would know how to do this

452
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,890
nah okay I know we have to get the

453
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,750
characters from point A to point B but

454
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,490
there were a lot of inmates in the

455
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,560
icebox did they all fit in one transport

456
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,940
including a special cell for the most

457
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,800
dangerous meeting ever I'll admit it's

458
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,210
mildly frustrating the Deadpool and

459
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,460
Domino both have actual superpowers that

460
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,110
completely short-circuit any attempt at

461
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,910
they survive this but since cable and

462
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,410
Russell were on there too they survived

463
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,660
this I'm gonna rip you in half now I

464
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,190
never thought I'd prefer anything from

465
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,690
x-men The Last Stand but at least their

466
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,100
version of juggernaut was much more

467
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,720
believable than this like myiasis

468
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,030
character even here also why is he so

469
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,320
pissed at Deadpool anyway there are

470
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,490
plenty of other people around here to

471
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,170
maim if he's just in the mood I suppose

472
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,700
there's some explanation in some Rando

473
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,560
comic from 1996 but they can also say

474
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,060
something about it in the movie you know

475
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,790
get me out of here please use my arms as

476
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,650
backpack straps help me understand how

477
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,150
Deadpool experiences pain we know he

478
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,980
feels what happens to him but then does

479
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,300
it immediately go away I mean he's

480
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,610
sitting propped up here completely split

481
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,470
in two wouldn't that's totally sting a

482
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,150
little bit so everyone left cable there

483
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,560
and walked off but they know he's trying

484
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,000
to kill Russell God ban this movie

485
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,560
resets itself constantly with very

486
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,420
little logical reason why is your head

487
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,320
so tiny again stop my hand at least

488
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
thirty percent of this movie is copy

489
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,560
pasted dialogue from two years ago it's

490
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,150
like he said Muppet from the waist down

491
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,190
but this time you can see the Muppets

492
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,500
movie repeats the entire pitch meeting

493
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,120
for the happy time murders you picked

494
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,110
around cold future boy is that really

495
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,970
necessary the discussion in the writers

496
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,440
room somehow I made it into the final

497
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,450
script I had two charges one to get me

498
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,640
here one to get me home well that's just

499
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,530
lazy writing is it because it sure is

500
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,910
all better than using the device for a

501
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,800
million different moments you may go

502
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
back

503
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,910
and stop the people that took your girl

504
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,130
would you whoa how does cable know about

505
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,570
Vanessa he didn't even get here until

506
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,950
after we'd had moved into the mansion

507
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,880
deal yeah

508
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,320
it's smart jokes like these that make

509
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,970
the sequel far superior to the original

510
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,920
movie I really want to match you know

511
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,320
happy a menacing teen the scene means

512
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,150
absolutely nothing and is exactly the

513
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,190
reason extended editions suck but I said

514
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,660
it throwing more nonsense in just

515
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,160
because you can doesn't make anything

516
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,080
better he said self-referential II say

517
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,240
whatever it is you're here to say what

518
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,820
I'll say is we're the for those guys

519
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,620
during the whole x-force versus cable

520
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,120
fight downtown a few hours ago they

521
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,680
obviously show up at scenarios like that

522
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,420
since they were johnny-on-the-spot when

523
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,650
Russell first went nuclear there

524
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,940
seriously no way to write these assholes

525
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,740
back into the movie until now it takes a

526
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,210
while for Wade to grow his legs back

527
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,980
then they have to go to the mansion on

528
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,660
the way to the orphanage so what took

529
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,190
Russell and juggernaut so long didn't

530
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,330
they leave immediately from the crash

531
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,920
scene to go kill the headmaster sure

532
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,780
they stopped at the Big &amp; Tall place but

533
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,010
how long would that take this movie even

534
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,840
bothered with a timeline pseudo clever

535
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,940
quips only cover up so much trust me I

536
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,170
know it's at this point in the movie

537
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,880
that the score consists of a chorus

538
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,220
repeating holy balls which is funny but

539
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,870
really only in the same way is Billy

540
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,370
lighting his farts on fire in middle

541
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,120
school okay

542
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,070
so we covered blind al being blind

543
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,270
Deadpool breaking the fourth wall

544
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,010
Deadpool being maimed in various ways

545
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,960
poop jokes and open door being nerdy

546
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,340
comic relief did we miss anything else

547
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,960
from the first movie oh I almost forgot

548
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,700
to impale DP in the head during the last

549
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,590
act I would have been embarrassing I

550
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,940
know our focus is supposed to be on the

551
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,800
Deadpool Colossus romance but why

552
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,510
doesn't juggernaut just tear cable and -

553
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,860
right here we saw him do it - Red Dead

554
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,700
reprehend earlier right big CGI sure but

555
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,990
just because you call attention to it

556
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,480
doesn't excuse that awesome considering

557
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,890
they've already been here at least 5

558
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,390
minutes already when exactly does that

559
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,070
whole arbitrary 30-second things start

560
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,570
it's clear that Domino is a martial arts

561
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,520
badass but fine for mutant power it's

562
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,960
luck why would she ever have to do any

563
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,570
training of any kind whatsoever mother

564
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,360
that's racist shock humor that's what

565
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,940
we're doing gosh really you take down

566
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,680
supervillains by shoving a live wire up

567
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,630
their ass and use a force blast to

568
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,310
propel them into water and I knew Putin

569
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,990
was bad but this is a whole new level I

570
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,480
got one more idea it's just a really bad

571
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,180
one even for me sure but considering his

572
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,070
last necklace just shorted out how is

573
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,150
this one even functional after

574
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,439
everything Wade's been through in the

575
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,880
last 20 minutes you're gonna kill

576
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,670
someone today

577
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,949
and it's gotta be me yeah but wait just

578
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,600
got hit with a massive blast of fire

579
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,860
then immediately put the meat in

580
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,240
Colorado shouldn't he be dying or the

581
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,839
burn wounds already bare it worked but

582
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,640
if the bear changed back because the

583
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,110
future is different doesn't that mean

584
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,549
cable would never show up here to begin

585
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:24,150
with

586
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,250
well I'm gonna need some straws and

587
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,929
Joseph gordon-levitt with Bruce Willis's

588
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:29,640
knows to explain this aren't I go to

589
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,640
hell time travel you're the worst before

590
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,010
I go this happens way too many times man

591
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,510
what are you going for here straight

592
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,370
comedy actual emotion testing the

593
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,380
audience's patience I'm going with C oh

594
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,390
cool Ted way it looks exactly like that

595
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,370
dude from the proposal just me like you

596
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,950
miss me right I appreciate the effort to

597
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,600
make this ending emotional but given

598
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,130
that this will all be undone in this

599
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,049
overtly insubordinate movie I can't get

600
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,100
on board it's like trying to trick

601
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,600
yourself into having an actual orgasm

602
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,760
when you're in your cousin you time

603
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,549
sliding son of a bitch you did this for

604
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,230
me why is Wayde glad to be saved here

605
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,370
when the last time he went through this

606
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,750
he stopped Colossus from breaking the

607
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,070
necklace and saving it I guess you could

608
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,750
say it's because he saw Vanessa but he

609
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,130
doesn't remember that right and if he

610
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,840
did why did he play dumb the second time

611
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,120
through a family so where are these

612
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,620
assholes going the threat is pretty much

613
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,120
over and they're walking away from the

614
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,530
still alive juggernaut they end up back

615
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,970
at the mansion eventually right are they

616
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,049
going for formal because I don't think

617
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,520
you can fit anymore into the post-credit

618
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,750
footage that's probably a bad idea oh I

619
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,280
know you've created a hilarious but

620
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,660
totally unnecessary post-credits

621
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,770
sequence that feels like Ryan Reynolds

622
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:44,850
indulging himself a little too much

623
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,620
Passion of the Christ then we beat them

624
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,150
overseas but there's no such things

625
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,800
religion remember the movie interview

626
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,470
with a vampire at what my Tom Cruise and

627
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,960

628
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,150
was fighting a caped badass never

629
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,980
discovered his mom is named Martha to

630
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,560
the Star Wars men are destined to become

631
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,390
their father that had consensual sex

632
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,340
with her sister you need to just keep

633
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,960
living thank you Matthew McConaughey

634
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,140

635
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,960
die I just need to die harder these old

636
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,870
guys on the wall who lives here Calista

637
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,580
Flockhart hearing three feet off the

638
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,350
ground to snatch up the nearest muffin

639
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,630
crumb enews live here at a breaking news

640
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,030
did you come quietly or dead it will be

641
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,550
trouble

642
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,740
is there like a sorting my superpower is

643
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,530
just unbridled cancer you have a bow and

644
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:32,860
arrow

645
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,040
basically Hawkeye piss off a grumpy old

646
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,940
crew with a Winter Soldier on from the

647
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,460
DC Universe and every film is a moment

648
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,400
when the hero hits rock bottom in Cool

649
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,870
Runnings it was when John Kennedy's

650
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,360
prized bobsled broke in Human Centipede

651
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,240
it was when those people signed on to be

652
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,840
in that movie

653
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,000

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,270
My Name Is Earl I love you

661
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,240
say it

662
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,429
say what you said every time you

663
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:43,470
tortured me

664
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,360
no you're doing what comes naturally

665
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,700
still they're happy

666
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,159
four or five moments great moments are

667
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,950
born from great opportunity no capes

668
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,570
this is the end story I don't feel so

669
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,049
good

670
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,000
