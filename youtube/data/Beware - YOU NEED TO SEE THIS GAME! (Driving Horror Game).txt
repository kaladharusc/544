1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,080
I don't think he saw us. (Sure Poods)

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,880
AHHHHHHH

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,820
What the hell? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,520
AHHHHHHH

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,000
*Original Intro*

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,120
Guys, today we're watching such a scary game that please watch it with a parental guardian *definitely*

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,620
or at least someone you can hold hands with.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,660
I don't even want to look at it, it looks so scary. *how you gonna play it then*

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,960
How do I do it? How do I keep playing horror games without getting so scared? I don't know.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,480
This is a driving horror game. Never heard of that. Have you heard of that? *Yes Poods*

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,020
I just hit play and nothing's happening. Game of the year! *Every Game is &quot;GAME OF THE Year&quot; for poods*

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,060
What the hell? It crashed didn't it? *Nah it didn't*

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,180
No, we're still in it everybody.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,680
Okay [wierd ass Poods laugh]

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
Alright well let's, let's freaking do this guys!

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa-ho, whoa!

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,340
Oh, it's too fast, it's too fast. Oh geez Rick. - Morty 2017

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,960
What the hell? Where am I goiiiing?

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,380
AHHHH

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,620
Am I even running away from someone? *Yes from demonetization*

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:25,440
Okay, okay, kay, kay, kay. Alright, we're going, we're going, we're going, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine. It's just bushes. Okay, here we go

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,380
I gotta make it out of here alive. *Zero Deaths*

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,620
Those goddamn Jacksepticeye fanboys, they're coming after me. *Marvel Fanboys too*

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,540
Jesus Christ! *Praise the Lord*

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,740
I'm fine, I'm fine.

26
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,700
Oh, did I hit something? *My Soul*

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,840
Shit, shit, they're coming.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:59,100
Shit, uh, I guess I'll die. *I hate it when that happens*

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,060
Woo-hoo! *Yee Haw*

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,100
You're never gonna catch me!

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:15,960
Oh damn, I'm the fastest driver in this, in this town, wherever I am.

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,060
Queue the 'deja vu'. Wait, wait for it, *sings* right into the niiiiight. *Horribly off-tune*

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,020
*still singing* Deja vu! I have been in this space before

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,880
higher than the streets, and I know it's my time to go!

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,300
Calling you. *normal voice* I don't even know what I'm running away from. How is this a horror game? This is spooky.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,360
Right *Inded Poods*

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh, wait, what's this?

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:53,300
Whoa, it looks so awesome!

39
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,960
No, no! Leave me alone! Dammit, faster! *Zero Deaths*

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,220
Oh god, this is genuinely scary.

41
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm just gonna keep driving fast dammit.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,740
[panting]

43
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,160
Come on. Okay. Deja vu.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,040
Jesus, I don't know about this guys. Why is it so creepy?

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,860
Ah, just keep going.

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:38,540
Oh god, there's a car. Oh god, they're fine, they're fine. Oh god, oh god, there's cars everywhere. Sorry, we're going off-road.

47
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,480
I don't think he saw us.

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,300
[yells] What the hell? Go, go, go, go, go, go!

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,100
[screams x2]

50
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:59,120
What the frick?! Get off my car you stupid hillbillies! Nothing wrong with being a hillbilly. Go go go, Jesus Christ, Jesus! *Swestian Channel*

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,160
What the heck was thaaaat?

52
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,260
AHHHHH

53
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,020
I don't know about this, bros.

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,420
[panting]

55
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,480
My god.

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,080
It's the Fortnite fanboys, it's the Marvel fanboys.

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:29,460
They've finally come after me. I'm sorry I don't like you.

58
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,360
Jesus Christ.

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:40,840
I didn't even do anything, go right? Oh shit it was the left turn. Oh god oh god I gotta get.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,780
Where does this turn?

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,580
Oh my god, I am freaking out.

62
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,500
Where am I going? I'm so lost.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,880
Okay, I think we chased them.

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
Oh god, there's another car. Don't go in the lake, don't go in the lake.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,660
Woooo! (x5)

66
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,280
Oh god, they're coming up. They're coming up behind me. Hey, watch where you're driving!

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,340
Assholes! [laughs] Stupid assholes, you'll never catch me!

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,140
Uh oh, AHHHH

69
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,280
We're fine, AHH, it's fine.

70
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,220
Stop. No, no! Get off my car. Get off my car you fatty fatties! Dammit.

71
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,380
They're two fat Fortnite fans.

72
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,580
Ahhh [laughs]

73
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,380
[claps]

74
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,780
Oh my god, finally a horror game that freaked me out a little bit! That's so fun.

75
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,480
So this is like an early version of the game, it's just a demo. Obviously they're gonna build on it.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,820
I feel like I said this a lot of times on games, and then they come out and it's like ehh, it's actually not that great

77
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:09,020
but I can definitely see some cool aspects to it like if there was a passenger next to us

78
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:20,140
adding dialogue, adding some dialogue and dynamic to the situation, some story and why they're hunting us. I don't know or maybe not!

79
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,480
So they start hunting you here.

80
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah.

81
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm a really bad driver, I don't know if you guys knew this.

82
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,580
I'm gonna genuinely try this time.

83
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,320
Look at this driving, boy.

84
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:11,920
Swedish racecar driver number one, handbrake initiated, don't hit the radio tower.

85
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,800
Such a unique concept as well. I've never heard of a horror racing game.

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,740
I didn't know if it would work or not, but it's genuinely scary.

87
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm not sure how long it will last. Oh god, they're in our rear winner- window. I can't speak, help me!

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,660
Help me, eeeh. There we go. Yes

89
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:46,440
We're going off-road baby! Bad idea, I don't know where the roads go.

90
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,640
The lights doesn't really help that much.

91
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:03,080
Okay, we're going this way. Oh god we're going in the woods. I hate woods, they scare me.

92
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,480
Okay, they're right behind us, go faster! No they're coming up!

93
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,900
[screams]

94
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,400
Assholes, get away from meeeee!

95
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,540
Dammit, AHHHH!

96
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:22,900
Keep going, keep going, keep up. No! Shit shit shit shit. Turn around. You'll never catch me!

97
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,600
Ahhh-AHH.

98
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,680
OOH OOH OOH AHH EE AHH EE AHH AHH

99
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,840
[speaks Swedish]

100
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:47,820
I think we got him. I think- nope, nevermind.

101
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:56,380
I am way too into this. Come on. Come on Felix. You can do it. We bel- we believe in you Felix! Thanks guys

102

106
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:27,620
Shit my- oh god. Okay, okay, maybe they don't see us. They definitely see us [laughs]

107
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh my god.

108
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,180
Some interesting turns.

109
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,720
They really start getting more aggressive after a while.

110
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,460
And I just walk in a- drive in a circle.

111
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,580
No, get away from me you stupid!

112
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,920
No, back it up.

113
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,940
Oh god!

114
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,900
[giggles]

115
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:10,980
I don't know about this. Deja vu! Come on, turn, he was supposed to turn around really awesomely.

116
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,120
Oh god, my car's stuck. No, my car is stuck! No!

117
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,840
NOOOO!

118
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,800
Stop hitting my car. Ah, damn it, death. I like that, 'DEATH'

119
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:53,900
I genuinely just want to play more, super interesting.

120
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh my god, I'm trying so hard.

121
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,140
I want to see how far you can make it, you know?

122
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:43,340
I think it's just in a looping map though. I'm not sure.

123
00:11:43,340 --> 00:12:02,060
Uh guys, you just try to pass me without blinking. Okay, super disrespectful.

124
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:14,040
Oh god, where am I going? Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Okay. Okay. Okay, kay, kay, kay.

125
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:22,140
Oh god, oh no, stop, go away bald people! Nooo!

126
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:35,480
Not like this, not like this, not like this. Where'd the bald people go? I killed bald people! HAHHHH!

127
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,380
[chuckles]

128
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:47,140
Yes!

129
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:54,070
Oooh, bet you didn't expect that, huh?

130
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:05,510
We're back on the off-road. Oh god, the sliding, look at it!

131
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,720
Ooh it's better without the headlights.

132
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,920
What the hellll?!

133
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,380
NO! Back-back-back-brrrrh!

134
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:24,240
Oh god, don't hit me. What did I just say? Guys, please.

135
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:43,340
You really messed up my car.

136
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,820
Oh, they're coming up on me again. Come onnn!

137
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,940
We're going fast.

138
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,220
Come on. Come on. I gotta turn.

139
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,580
Ooh damn, you can actually crash.

140
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,880
Sheesh, it's like your car is your health.

141
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Anyway, super cool game. Really love this demo. If you're interested in it, check out link in the description. Hooray!
