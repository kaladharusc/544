[Music]

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,509
so all five of these friends were alive

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,150
and completely the same in 1897 I get

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,830
that vampires are immortal and you could

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,210
even convince me that Frank and mummy

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,369
dearest are the same but do wolf persons

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,590
and invisibles not age either tickets

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,150
ladies character doesn't look at

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,769
obviously disguised characters for us

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,630
sensible comedic effect cliche what is

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,590
this another scooby-doo sequel not only

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,090
is this German child speaking English

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,950
but he's speaking modern English slang

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,110
in 1897 I am now pretty sure young

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,360
Friedrich von Kaka Schmidt here can

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,800
travel through time except if he goes

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,450
forward he has to live as an old man and

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,829
if he goes backwards he ends up as a

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,510
child so whenever he tries to tell

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,829
anyone there they think he's a child

21
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,450
playing make-believe or senile old man

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,800
my point is I'm already so bored with

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,270
this movie that I'm writing other movies

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,969
in my head and this can't be a good son

25
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:59,670
yes one of the Van Helsing's

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,770
Expos introduction oh yeah remember when

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,390
the famous vampire hunter of Anthony

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,400
hull skins used the laser gun to subdue

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,080
Dracula always an underrated part of

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,820
that legendary story I know you haven't

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,960
even gotten into the movie yet but

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,820
seriously why isn't he firing this gun

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,760
he's got him dead to rights he survives

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,700
this and this and this and this and this

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,400
and this and this and this and this sure

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
it's a cartoon but just remember that

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,509
death or danger has exactly zero stakes

38
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,040
for anyone in this universe considering

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,270
this movie attended the wily coyote

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,610
school of surviving things and sunny she

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,790
doesn't cry she bites the thing I love

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,560
most about the Hotel Transylvania is the

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,869
adorably casual cannibalism natus looks

44
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,430
less like a married a hundred and twenty

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,570
six year old vampire and then a

46
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,430
millennial that used a gift card at the

47
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,020
lazy Raven that her cousin gave her last

48
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,790
year the day I married Johnny was the

49
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,079
best day of my life

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,850
Oh awesome Johnny's back from the last

51
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,399
two movies anyone care pink Johnny we're

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,340
not allowed to bring our dogs I mean our

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,470
pets everywhere this seems like a very

54
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,149
simple and important rule that should

55
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,070
land these two assholes in giant trouble

56
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,780
you can even find someone to sing with

57
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,659
on your phone now setting easy tinder

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,729
humor aside why would it be Holloman

59
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,200
that brought it up isn't he the one

60
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,630
person without a profile pic I'm looking

61
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,890
for a date skip I'm lonely I understand

62
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,750
you want Bologna when we're doing this

63
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,700
part of a film to fill some time before

64
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,070
we leave for a boat boss good okay just

65
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,510
put the entire trailer in there oh you

66
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,980
know what that's why you're the boss

67
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,930
boat's not into senticles

68
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,520
wait if dating apps in the monster

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,350
universe exist there would totally be a

70
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,210
vampire specific one it took like three

71
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,920
seconds after Grindr was released for

72
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,080
wine Christian farmers with neck tattoos

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,210
meetup.com to star and a vampire woman

74
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,290
wouldn't even have to be that specific

75
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,260
Matt found forget the fact that Drakon

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,880
black here didn't even swipe that

77
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,410
picture at all what kind of dating app

78
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,850
immediately video calls a person after

79
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,070
it finds a match for you eavesdropping

80
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,080
barging in and blocking or the old

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,820
boner killer trifecta yeah absolutely

82
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,690
right

83
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,340
I think the only specific direction Adam

84
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,660
Sandler was given was to use the most

85
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,770
annoying register in his vocal range are

86
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,320
you a monster this is clearly a setup

87
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,970
for them to get on the boat right if so

88
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,040
how did they know Mabus was thinking

89
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,450
about a vacation right the second and

90
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,060
that this TV is on and how did they even

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,160
take the TV over in the first place I

92
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,140
can deal with all kinds of fantastical

93
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,910
creatures in this movie but this is some

94
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,950
bull

95
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,420
as crazy as this looks still not

96
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,010
anywhere near is back but insane as

97
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,430
gremlins to 20 because they're monsters

98
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,709
and all monsters are assholes I guess is

99
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,540
it funny also why do they have to take a

100
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,220
monster specific airplane at all they

101
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,630
were riding perfectly well on the train

102
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,550
a few centuries ago before Van Hot

103
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,810
Pockets showed up and why doesn't

104
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,580
Dracula have his own boat specifically

105
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,350
for these purposes

106
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,700
[Music]

107
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,830
god bless Adam Sandler for doing the

108
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,940
work of bringing attention to the

109
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,530
genital trauma humor this country needs

110
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,870
in these trying times I mean since every

111
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,220
day in this country feels like a new

112
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,540
kick in the balls why shouldn't our

113
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,890
movies reflect it so authentically

114
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,989
poured the hours in the closet sized

115
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,480
room with you and uncle Bernie arguing

116
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,700
who was more interactive Cleopatra or

117
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,920
Nefertiti I'll admit that 40 hours is a

118
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,269
long time but it's not like they were

119
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,410
talking about the structural integrity

120
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,420
of a steel reinforced casket man they're

121
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,340
discussing intimate details about two of

122
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,959
the most attractive women in the history

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,470
of history

124
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,470
that's hardly a snooze fest the series

125
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,090
is clearly an exercise and stretching

126
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,500
the very limits of Adam Sandler's

127
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,300
tolerability to a film audience getting

128
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,039
there then increasing it by 3,000

129
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,140
percent

130
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,550
cuz up with this giant puppy why is it

131
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,660
here and why do we care about it wait

132
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,220
there was a shirt I had to catch

133
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,870
in addition to two other movies I'm

134
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,979
forced to sit through I can't believe

135
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,860
I'm saying this but that puppy sure most

136
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,660
if not all these assholes are immortal

137
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,400
but incredibly human Johnny survives

138
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,700
this who made you such an amazing doctor

139
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,990
it's like Adam Sandler watch Steve

140
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,460
Carell in the first despicable me and

141
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,500
said hey I can easily do a borderline

142
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,210
offensive Eastern European accent for a

143
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,070
similarly unlikable and ghoulish

144
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,510
character for three stupid movies to

145
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,789
came out Steve this is an absurdly large

146
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,020
ship right so why are there so few

147
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,190
people booked on it there were only a

148
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,660
couple of dozen on the plane and we

149
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,340
haven't been shown anyone else boarding

150
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,780
yeah what's up with that other than a

151
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,130
cheap excuse to show a more tinkles

152
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,810
footage won't even qualifies as a pet in

153
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,490
this universe they literally have a blob

154
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,960
of slime that travels with them it's

155
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,310
that not hard to clean up after

156
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,419
darling what's the movie that we take

157

158
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,880
explain awkward things afterwards all

159
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,650

of discussion hi mom what in the van

he's surly again now tell you what I'm

168
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,449
just gonna add 20 cents for each time

169
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,189
Drax a grumpy dickhead then is talked

170
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,749
into having fun only to appear in the

171
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:46,949
very next scene is a grumpy dickhead

172
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,699
that's nice thank fire bad remember

173
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,529
despite his asshole demeanour Drac would

174
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,479
be excellent at cinema since what am I

175
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,919
saying because of his asshole demeanor

176
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,149
Drac would be perfect its innocence

177
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:02,459
oh no he's having a heart attack or he's

178
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,349
recycling the exact thing he did in his

179
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:09,659
SNL audition either way it's bad to be

180
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,379
scary

181
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:12,059
hang on is this literally an allegory

182
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:14,039
for the gay cruise experience is that

183
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,269
okay to do have they checked with the

184
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:15,869
proper authorities

185
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,399
I'm just saying someone's gonna be

186
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,919
offended really fish cravats is the best

187
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,179
you could come up with I mean a crow

188
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:26,519
bass is right there or three-ring circus

189
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,839
circuit if Elaine don't try to go

190
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,119
portmanteau to toe with me mister no no

191
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,559
not okay

192
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,169
not okay somehow Adam Sandler's initial

193
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,669
script reactions made it into the final

194
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:41,039
film hey well you might want to change

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,050
your front cape then I went to the moped

196
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,569
store salesman's like what up what's

197
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,369
your budget I genuinely have no clue why

198
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:48,659
these fish are doing a spoken word

199
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,459
version of a Macklemore song but it

200
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,199
feels funny and subversive and since

201
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,729
there's nothing else like that in the

202
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,050
movie I'm gonna angrily send this

203
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,309
mackerel more a moment instead of

204
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,749
registering my appreciation for its

205
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,639
inclusion so blob no heart here is

206
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,860
asexual and procreates by getting sick

207
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,240
and vomiting up its children does that

208
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,129
mean that tongues or birth control is

209
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,469
epic an aphrodisiac our blob frat

210
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,599
parties full of new kids by the end of

211
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,629
the night I've so many questions how are

212
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,159
these obviously feral puppies not

213
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,469
considered pets goddamnit that no pet

214
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,879
sign at the beginning was the stupidest

215
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,039
part of a very stupid movie and five

216
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,749
cents damage I'm still not sure I

217
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:24,559
understand you take my kids all day

218
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,119
purpose dear gluten-free God and

219
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,679
unleavened heaven another side story

220
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,300
this movie doesn't have a plot so much

221
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,039
as it has a series of unrelated and

222
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,959
astonishingly unfunny sketches it's like

223
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,789
SNL had a baby with a sentient piece of

224
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,240
raw sewage whatever we want

225
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,259
whatever we want whatever we want

226
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,479
this goes on for some time also didn't

227
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,310
they have at least some assistance at

228
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,690
the Hotel Transylvania I know this

229
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,009
boring parents finally get a break from

230
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,720
the kids Fantasy plays to a certain part

231
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,130
of the audience but like everything in

232
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,110
this movie is dialed up to 11 to boil

233
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,660
all the humor out of it so right

234
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,090
great-grandfather villain poses as love

235
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,500
interest of the protagonist before

236
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,300
immediately showing her long lineage of

237
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,990
evil cliche and so I began to search

238
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,960
France this is a character reading 4x

239
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,819
position during narration in a flashback

240
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,710
this is like the turducken of sin

241
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,479
moments this movie is a cheap maximum

242
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,949
sin Duncan and Leslie I searched and I

243
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,659
did this instead of finding virtually

244
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:21,800
any other way to kill this one

245
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,080
individual also I mean seriously even if

246
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
one man alone can't take drag out there

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,650
are so many other things to try trying

248
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,880
to burn the castle down recruit an army

249
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,740
to seize it recruit a relocation service

250
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,149
to move the entire castle to the equator

251
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,890
this is the most convoluted and

252
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,260
expensive plan ever conceived even

253
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,149
dumber than operation faithful patriot a

254
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,430
full 90 seconds of an alternative Bruno

255
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,649
Mars video for 24-karat magic that's

256
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,360
almost as stupid as the original video

257
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,370
movie is now taking a few minutes for an

258
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,200
attempted murder dance montage I swear

259
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,310
the actual script of this thing must

260
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,200
have been like five pages it doesn't

261
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
make any sense

262
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,770
you can't sing twice well I mean it's

263
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,750
all dependent on medication you take and

264
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,579
the length of the refractory period and

265
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,690
of course the willingness of your

266
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,060
partner so I wouldn't say you can't also

267
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,070
jokes aside what the hell is with this

268
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,690
rule Dracula is essentially immortal as

269
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,950
long as he follows certain rules about

270
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,570
crosses in the Sun to the universe

271
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,980
seriously set up a general rule that

272
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,570
even if you live forever you can only be

273
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,890
content with one person

274
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,360
I mean Ariana Grande's already broken

275
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,709
this rule several times and she's only

276
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,930
25 why is the water up to dracs waist

277
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,089
but below Mavis when we know for a fact

278
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,560
that Drac is quite a bit taller than

279
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
Mavis out of the water

280
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,140
aside from the fact that this Bigfoot

281
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,970
joke is the same Bigfoot joke as the

282
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,320
last five times we've seen it in this

283
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,730
movie alone this movie make up its mind

284
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,890
on his size somehow he was able to sit

285
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,779
inside a plane that would now easily be

286
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,829
crushed by his step

287
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,209
why does so many of the monsters need a

288
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,130
scuba tank like the vampires are already

289
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,750
dead they don't need to breathe same

290
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,370
goes for the mummy right really the only

291
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,470
one that needs this Johnny and movie

292
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,910
said pal to that character thirty

293
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,589
minutes ago huh I guess convoluted

294
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,270
stupid expensive unnecessary plans

295
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,130
really do run in the van helsing family

296
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,079
thinking it was too obvious to jump the

297
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:51,830
shark though

298
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,450
you literally decided to hypnotize it

299
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,890
and ride it around the ocean is that

300
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,140
Johnny a human swimming over an active

301
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,910
volcano that's currently erupting god

302
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,340
damn this movie stupid so the legs are

303
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,660
what caught your suspicion and not the

304
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,680
obvious mechanical submarine the fact

305
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,150
that this movie stupidly wastes talents

306
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,620
like keegan-michael key makes me mad

307
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,300
enough to mummify my monitor so I don't

308
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,380
have to watch anymore this bolt

309
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,300
complementor your neck looks delicious

310
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,730
yeah about that none of the three full

311
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,860
vampires and one half empire have eaten

312
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,330
on this entire trip it's not like there

313
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,100
are many humans to pick from - so Drac

314
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,450
is gonna need to make a move regardless

315
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,250
unless he wants to start snacking on

316
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,970
pork and Johnny oh yeah remember that

317
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,440
case story that I'm sure will have a

318
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,790
huge impact on the overall narrative

319
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,900
yeah me neither

320
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,700
hope you people that paid the extra in

321
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,350
the theater for the 3d images of drool

322
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,030
being throwing your face we're extremely

323
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,940
satisfied har-har this menus full of so

324
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,800
many bad puns and cliches it just got

325
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,420
greenlit as a family comedy on Netflix

326
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,790
also there's a lot of bull on that menu

327
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,250
but still no blood despite knowing this

328
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,170
is exactly where vampires go on vacation

329
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,520
have you a beverage to quench me of my

330
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,490
parchment damn even the troupe of cameos

331
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,140
are over stuffed in this movie edit

332
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,260
komali that's so that's so racist

333
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,780
I guess the movies been holding that

334
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,580
fart joke in for almost 10 minutes which

335
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,660
has got to be some kind of record

336
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,660
my wife died how old was your daughter

337
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,850
she was just an infant

338
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,590
man we're getting some Highlander style

339
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,210
both on the ages here the rack is

340
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,010
obviously super old but he looks

341
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,570
middle-aged and you can assume he was

342
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,890
turned into a vampire around that age

343
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,560
but Mavis is 126 and she looks like a

344
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,900
con Selena Gomez right but she had an

345
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,820
infancy my point is like every other

346
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,530
vampire movie before you just give us

347
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:38,090
some goddamn rules oh that's cute honey

348
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,130
well it's been fun last one out turn out

349
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,520
the lights

350
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,980
we're done here I'm not sure which is

351
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,390
the endless side plants in this flaming

352
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,710
pile of a movie is the most pointless

353
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,810
but loop on Duggars ditching their pups

354
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:59,080
is the leader in the clubhouse for sure

355
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,310
despite everyone being in the proper

356
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,780
place to eavesdrop all over the ship

357
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,850
this loud argument is totally private in

358
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,240
fact

359
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,070
when mr. pink and superstar finally do

360
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,660
show up they haven't heard discount mr.

361
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,020
ruby boogie too

362
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,970
yep the apex of the culture of humanity

363
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,500
throughout all of history is visualized

364
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,510
as a king las vegas casino I honestly

365
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,490
think the cast has lost track here and

366
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,230
think they're making grownups 3 which

367
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,000
takes place entirely in Monte Carlo I

368
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,920
can't lie to my own daughter anymore

369
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,380
she's the most important person in the

370
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,330
world to me and I'm reciting my

371
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,920
character motivation so that they will

372
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,540
be clear to the audience who may have

373
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,690
fallen asleep 30 minutes ago Bob why

374
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,760
would he be with Bob Bob's a great guy

375
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,709
isn't me here is Johnny getting more and

376
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,630
more stupid in this series whatever zing

377
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,130
Mavis saw in him in the first place has

378
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,480
apparently been smoked out of him and

379
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,279
security at Atlantis the most secretive

380
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,750
location in the entire world by the way

381
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,850
is way looser than I thought it would be

382
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,440
honest I can't tell if this moustache

383
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
gang is actually kind of funny or if

384
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,890
it's just the thinnest kid at phat game

385
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,600
either way it's sad when this is the

386
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,980
closest you get to a laugh and a movie

387
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,450
that's supposed to be checking my notes

388
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,779
yep a comedy holy jesus is chasing is

389
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,430
taking so long I think it's about to

390
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,300
take the record from bullet Yeomans

391
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,680
well for one monsters are apparently

392
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,970
allowed to party in a location that's

393
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,350
been hidden from everyone in history

394
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,329
with no supervision I'm here to get that

395
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,149
yeah it's a family heirloom yeah it was

396
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,120
lost it at sea Kathryn Hahn usually has

397
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,040
a very distinct voice but you could have

398
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,300
easily convinced me that this was

399
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,800
Jennifer Aniston this is like Kathryn

400
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,120
Hahn literally doing a Jennifer Aniston

401
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,589
impression and it's distracting us from

402
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,329
the scene with their black and white

403
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,100
outfits and setting off booby traps only

404
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,959
makes me long for a really well done Spy

405
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,970
vs spy movie or the sweet release of

406
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,500
death I'd honestly take either at this

407
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,170
point man good thing none of those

408
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,240
arrows or made out of wood aren't there

409
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,770
several sticking into where Drax heart

410
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,089
would be even if they came through his

411
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:54,529
back he's pretty dead right now

412
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,390
right Drac decides to run Erica out of

413
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,490
here instead of simply flying since we

414
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,930
got to stretch this for as

415
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,420
long as it'll go I could never be with a

416
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,850
monster oh sweet if we're already at the

417
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,170
protagonist fight right before the end

418
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,730
of the movie cliche and that means it's

419
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,980
almost done right right

420
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,530
never lies really is this another solid

421
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,150
attribute of a Xing or like the

422
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,130
previously mentioned only zinging wants

423
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,470
is one that might change is there a Xing

424
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,120
king who decides on these things at

425
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,380
Monster weddings do they have Xing

426
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,120
bearers to some mayor just survive on a

427
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,470
singing prayer can you have a zing fling

428
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,060
is a divorce considered a zing animus

429
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm just saying this whole Xing thing is

430
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,210
plot contrived nonsense and well

431
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,710
deserving of at least 30 Zynga

432
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,220
ding-dings

433
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,930
I know I made an Okie boogie crack

434
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,850
before but I mean between the Halloween

435
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,830
esteem the cranky old genius with a god

436
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,330
complex that's stuck in a mobility

437
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,130
device the shelter daughter figure

438
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,930
looking for more to her existence the

439
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,370
implementation of a whole new world and

440
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,170
the singing sack of bugs out in the

441
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,820
water we've got an honest-to-god

442
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,160
Nightmare Before Christmas ripoff I'm

443
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
just gonna go ahead and send this for

444
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,800
being way too many minutes of a rave

445
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,480
that even I'd be too old for let alone

446
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,010
monsters who's been around for hundreds

447
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,050
of years what's most important to

448
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,100
understand is that what I'd like to

449
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,570
understand is where the spotlight is

450
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,040
coming from that is following him during

451
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,660
his blue light special because it's

452
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,490
never even addressed of course part of

453
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,960
me is glad considering they probably

454
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,250
would have just panned up to see some

455
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,990
sort of monster eating baked beans whose

456
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,300
farts have a blue glow so silver linings

457
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,390
I guess you can't deny Xing monster

458
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,360
human unicorn god damn it that's the

459
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,730
second overt allusion to bestie allottee

460
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,380
in this movie and I'm freaked out that

461
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,060
whomever wrote it is getting into the

462
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,690
minds of the current generation

463
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,490
[Music]

464
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,870
so it was everyone okay with dying this

465
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,370
took several seconds to set up which is

466
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,320
a ton of time for drag or Mavis to run

467
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,820
up there and snatch the music they all

468
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,380
just too curious to see how this bold

469
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:50,800
ending turns out if you got Megadeth up

470
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,790
there you could have had an entire

471
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,750
symphony so let's talk about Van

472
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,699
Helsing's plan shall we somehow convince

473
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,260
all the monsters to go on a cruise on a

474
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,089
ship his daughter captain's to get them

475
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,680
out to the lost city of Atlantis and

476
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,570
even though he already has the location

477
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,980
of this secret weapon and knows all

478
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,269
about it he waits until they're all

479
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,130
there to try and retrieve and since he

480
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,690
had a synth ready he must have known

481
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,120
that inside was a dubstep song that had

482
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,589
survived the destruction of the city and

483
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,300
any kind of water damage so that he

484
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,800
could play it with all the monsters

485
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,480
gathered at a rave he also somehow knew

486
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,920
that this would initiate the crack to

487
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,389
attack and destroy the monsters who

488
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,490
again somehow all decided on their own

489
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,720
to take this vacation do I have that

490
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,350
right do I then release the crack sins

491
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,029
[Music]

492
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,589
to be fair this is also my immediate and

493
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,570
visceral reaction to hearing dubstep rap

494
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,820
but many of you can fly and you can take

495
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,220
other goddamnit this is pointless I've

496
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,480
written so many crack and related

497
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,949
sincere that it's getting redundant in

498
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:46,630
my head so just trust me when I say

499
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,740
horrible but then a Pirates of the

500
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,699
Caribbean sequel and metal cover kind of

501
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:57,790
like Kanye and Kim get ready for a DJ

502
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,670
battle you just carry all that stuff

503
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,769
around with you yakety Drax has a point

504
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,299
but would still suck at cinemasins

505
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:05,650
because that's how much I hate this

506
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,199
movie no credit given suck banging we're

507
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,140
gonna use good music to defeat his evil

508
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,970
music and you know this works because

509
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,640
just forget it can someone just say they

510
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,079
all live crappy ever after so we can

511
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,000
call it a day oh dude you don't even

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,890
know how bad it is to watch it I like

513
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,449
this magical DJ scene when I saw it

514
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:26,890
years ago and Scott Pilgrim vs. the

515
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,990
world so I was about an extra 40 cents

516
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,790
for how long boring and unnecessary this

517
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,669
is a old mother this Cape is showing

518
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,320
zero doctor strange tendencies this

519
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,970
entire movie but it's now dancing the

520
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,860
Macarena on its own because that's the

521
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,240
song that defeated the musically

522
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,950
hypnotized singing Kraken to save the

523
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,330
monsters does someone bother to say this

524
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,320
stuff out loud at any point in the

525
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
writers room

526
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
plage product placement meets slime

527
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,400
product placement slime blush

528
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,340
movie and hopefully franchise ends on

529
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,080
one of the least important plot points

530
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,460
in the history of the King franchise

531
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,410
although look I might be talked into

532
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,120
seeing a spinoff the features that jazz

533
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,490
fish group but said too much

534
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,070
and if I see van helsing could there be

535
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,880
a female gremlin lipstick boobies bitch

536
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,470
you have he and little gremlin vajayjay

537
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,780
I love it so much that it's not only in

538
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,520
the movie but it's definitely in the

539
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,980
movie I'm gonna go check on you know loo

540
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,510
I'll be right back I have waited so long

541
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,910
to meet you I'm gonna roll you into a

542
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,620
little ball shove you up my vagina you

543
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:48,120
live there I replaced my feelings with

544
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,830
[Music]

545
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,000
release the Kraken
