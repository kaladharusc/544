dear Candace I really really like you

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,670
let me explain why

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,679
I love that you married me after knowing

11
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,420
me for only three weeks even though your

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,829
parents made us get it annulled

13
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,750
I love how much you love dogs I love

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,170
that you eat ring dings and doughnuts I

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,700
love that 10 years ago you helped me

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,470
with a video about our relationship even

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:37,140
though we were broken up I'm sorry I was

18
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,640
such a jerk to you all those years I

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
love that you don't give a fuck that you

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,819
never feel like you have to address to

21
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,159
impress anyone that you were sweatpants

22
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,929
and Uggs to work on a Tuesday I love

23
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:46,890
that you don't look in the mirror before

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,840
you leave the house I loved it in six

years eight years of us living together

I've never once seen you brush your hair

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,609
I also love that when you do dress up

28
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,540
you own it like a movie star

00:02:31,659 --> 00:03:06,430
are actually eating live maggots I loved

39
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,400
that one time in 2012 when when in order

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,019
for me to get back together with you I

41
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,370
had to sit down with you and agree to

42
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,989
terms that you had typed up and

43
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,470
presented to me at a meeting in a park

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,830
could have shut down your business you

didn't give up you pushed through and

54
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,620
you started another business that was

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,300
more successful than anything you ever

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,840
did with her I love that I love that
