1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,490
so I was at the beauty supply store

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,950
shocking I know and I went in there was

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,750
something totally different in mind and

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,640
when I saw her I knew it was game over

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,289
what you saw her too

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,619
once I realized who she was I couldn't

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,340
take my eyes away from her it was a she

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,730
and she was a beautiful human hair beard

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,640
and there was no way I was gonna leave

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,489
that store without her it's done it

11
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,590
needs to be on my face and it was very

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,629
expensive so I'm gonna have to reuse it

13
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,760
many times to get my money's worth I

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,280
feel like I wanted a beard for so long

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,260
there's I've literally even dyed my own

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,809
mustache with just four men to see if I

17
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,629
could make it more mustache II like I

18
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,969
just would really enjoy some actual

19
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,920
facial hair there is a shockingly low

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,680
amount of women giving themselves beards

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,960
on purpose native hair on YouTube that I

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,359
feel like what is going on here am I the

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,580
only person that just desperately wants

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,180
a beard I don't think I'm alone I really

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,760
don't I can't be they sold it to me like

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,100
this it comes with its own mustache

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,549
whose hair is this it has some beautiful

28
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,770
like natural gray in there I got it as

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,320
close to my hair as possible because I

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,720
really I just wanted oh so excited now

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,490
the way that they had these displayed in

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,729
the store it was like trimmed and

33
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:33,780
obviously since it's real hair we can

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,579
trim it but like you know your girl got

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,710
haircutting scissors because I am a

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,520
salon owner sure it

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,350

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,240
do all the same treatments that they

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,439
would for like a wig or something

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,720
definitely someone's like hair on their

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,909
head that they used for this

43
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,950
really I just I want to put this on and

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,420

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:13,090

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,230
when it's on my face

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,049

DNA left behind and I would have real

64
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,680
DNA so the suspects would be me and a
