your everyday life and suddenly

188
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:09,530
[Music]

189
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,850
eventually they started hiring assassins

190
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,020
to take them out shit

191
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,510
this battery business is hardcore mr.

192
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,050
energizer bunny hippity hoppity days are

193
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,980

194
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,360
they're pretty funny for a while but

195
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,520
suddenly Darth Vader couldn't even take

196
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:31,910
him out what the shit is this

197
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,890
why do the Empire even need his battery

198
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,930
is it like the force cuz there's a

199
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,880
positive and a negative side that's a

200
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,360
stupid he's better that seems kind of

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,130
trivial while you're at it close down

202
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,290
Bea Arthur's Cantina and give Han Solo

203
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:55,730

204
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,079
oops looking like a little bitch by

205
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:00,929
comparison now you got a skip by a guy

206
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,329
who came and take out a toy bunny fader

207
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:04,589

208
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,439
symbols like will be one has taught you

209
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,049
well but the bunny beats him because the

210
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,149
Empire can't afford better batteries for

211
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,470
his lightsaber health care and batteries

212
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,529
that's always where the cuts are that's

213
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:23,910
still more dignified than when he

214
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,190
screamed No

215
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,820
[Applause]

218
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,910
stayed an icon no matter how annoyingly

219
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:43,840

331
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:27,930
widest of cereals would have the widest

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,939
of commercials no cornflakes are daddy

333
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,160

334
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,420
come up with a pretty convincing

335
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,490
argument to get me to change my mind

336
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,470
problem number one a kid is trying to

337
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,589
steal his dad's cornflakes since friggin

00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,430
well just watch you'd have to come up

342
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,350
with a pretty convincing argument to get

343
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,460
me to change my mind

344
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:08,990

were these guys just waiting for someone

353
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,289
randomly to say they need to be

354
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,240
convinced that cornflakes could be eaten

355
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,940
by kids too was that like their lifelong

356

363
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,820

I think we waste their lives

373
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,600
there's no think about it totally crazy

374
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,640
and dated in all the wrong ways this is

375
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,190
a lame way to wake up to a lame cereal

376
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,890
well that was pretty convincing Sun set

377

378
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,360
commercial that's a real commercial here

379
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:19,120
punchline oh yeah these damn things

380
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,130
in the early 2000s Quiznos tried

381
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,930
something hauntingly different by

382
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,180
introducing the sponge monkeys they were

383
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,920
photoshopped acid dreams that looked

384
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,990
like villains from Wonder Pets if you

385
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,610
feel they look ungodly and unnatural

386
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,980
fear not their heavenly voices will win

387
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:47,260

388
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,790

392
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,350

[Music]

399
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,340
unless that's a place where pepper

400

403
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,929
appeals to us don't teenagers would have

404
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,510
marketing buys don't teenagers this must

405
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,559
have been made up at the last minute

406
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,880
while somebody was coming off of

407
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,010
quaaludes so what's your ad person

408
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,419
getting paid thousands of dollars to

409
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,059
represent us sponge monkeys yeah and

410
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,850
they got a song goes like this which I'm

411
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:56,450
totally not just making up right now

412
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,770
sponge monkey I've waited all my life

413
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,650
for someone to say that you can even

414
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,809
hear the announcer being like Quiznos

415
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,210
has all-new subs that oh god what is

416
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,429
that I didn't know us attached to

417
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,140
garbage like that I thought this was a

418
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,020
respectable company oh hell no I'm out

419
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,410
of here

420
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:23,299
[Music]

421
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,190
it makes no sense and I guess that's the

422
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,530
point but to their credit I do remember

423
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,990
it and so do a lot of people it is what

424
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,590
it is

425
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:40,090
I just don't know what it is Wiz knows

426
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,670
[Music]

427
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,200
like any hit movie hook had action

428
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,910
figures to sell and they had commercials

429
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,800
to go along with them okay that kid is

430
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,810
getting way too much joy out of hook

431
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,490
dangling there he looks like for the

432
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,620
first time he's feeling shoe power power

433
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,540
over plastic dustin hoffman's that he

434
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,820
will eat upon ridicule he will taste

435
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:10,200
like victory boy they really downplayed

436
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,460
rufio's death didn't they honestly I

437
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,900
feel like a lot of these scenes could be

438
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,720
more faithful to the movie then for

439
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
preschoolers Playmobil hook action

440
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,540

a grown woman lusted after a teenage boy

445
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,870
all these years I guess creepy is the

446
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,580
new cute nevertheless it's a lot of fun

447
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,440
and captures most of the spirit of the

448
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,540
film pretty well a decent toy yet based

449
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:19,010
on a decent movie yeah can't like this

450
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,170
wasn't a huge thing New Kids on the

451
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,300
Block had so much merchandise it was

452
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,220
hard to keep track of but these creepy

453
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,120

466
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,530
serious again I'm deep but the best of

467
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,000
these ads are the ones that pin the

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,830
fangirls against each other to see who's

469
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:15,260
the scariest I'm number one fan because

470
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm gonna pay for all their unemployment

471
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,230
bills when they're not popular anymore

472
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,820
that's not just dedication that's

473
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,790
practical seriously how far can these

474
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,040
obsessions go I'm their number one fan

475
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,930
because I collected samples of Johnny's

476
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,150
hair to add to my voodoo doll he'll go

477
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,230

478
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,990
testicles in a blender I'm their number

479
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,700
one fan because I've collected enough of

480
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,560
Danny's blood to make several clones

481
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,120

[Applause]

485
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,330
New Kids on the Block cause the kids

486
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,309
come with Cosette a little obsessive but

487
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,110
I guess that was the intent this ad did

488
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,700
a good job making sure everyone tried to

489
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,250
be their number one fan stage hanging

490
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,480
those kids and accessories sold

491
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:23,799
separately yeah

492
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,690

toys how the Batman Returns get in

494
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:29,140
trouble for having happy meals and yet a

495
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,120
movie with countless and palings have

496
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,640
these at every Toys R Us what can we say

497
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,410
we thought the sequel would be more for

498
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,120
kids after seeing the first one a family

499
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,059
product fight evil with his mobile adult

500
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,040
vehicles yeah remember that from the

501
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,929
movie I think you're confusing though

502
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:48,730
with Arnold's other vehicle from Batman

503
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,500
and Robin a film that should have been

504
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,780
our on principle guide with the

505
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,740
policeman evil t1000 aim good boy his

506
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,030
shape-shifting is improving because that

507
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,370
looks nothing like Robert Patrick looks

508
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,230
more like Tom Arnold escaping questions

509
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,870
about Rose an evil t1000 aim didn't the

510
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,970
movie kind of address this can form

511
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,980
complex machines guns and explosives

512
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,260
have chemicals moving parts it doesn't

513
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,770
work that way

514
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,169
bullshit Kenner disagrees he can totally

515
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:18,910
do that now I think it'd have to be

516
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,620
seeing how stabbing weapons look like a

517
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,370
melting Washington Monument this time

518
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,960
here's another one that's kind of cool

519
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,179
actually pumping Arnold up with human

520
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:31,900
flesh over the endoskeleton dead flesh

521
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,260
compound terminator created there is one

522
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,160
drawback though terminator I'm

523
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,680
ah I don't think you're ready to fight

524
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,250
yet

525
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,650
Arnold still got close before kicking

526
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,430
some ass

527
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,810
granted you might be looking for a lot

528
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,370
of these looks but you know with that

529
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,810
package I don't think you're gonna get

530
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,790
much Mama's anatomically impaired as a

531
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,460
kendo no despite not being a ton like

532
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,840
the movie the commercials are still

533
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,430
pretty creative and captured the tone of

534
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,490
an r-rated gorefest seriously this is so

535
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,000
weird

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,110
the party's over t1000 adios amigo her

537
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,480
wait was it he said something is Spanish

538
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't know nobody will remember it

539
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,940
when you're a toy company you have to

540
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,590
ask the question what are girls most

541
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,650
likely to play with dolls fashion a

542
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,210
wizard in a bubble that can predict the

543
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,300
future but usual what was that last one

544
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,610
ask sand or wave your hand and he speaks

545
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,490
ask Zander is a dating game no need to

546
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,500
rewind the video I'll repeat it it's a

547
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,390
dating game about which boy likes you

548
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,760
this game clearly understands every

549
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
girl's need to talk relationships with a

550
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,100
warlock

551
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,140
am I going to the prom with a geek

552
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,980
please say no lord knows there's no

553
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,720
geeks in this room that's the wizard

554
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,410
another question why do secret admirer

555
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,560
absolutely he knows everything is there

556
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,669
a future for me and Bobby

557
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:03,820
hello Bobbi its Melinda I think it's

558
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,940
time we broke up I really thought we

559
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,950
were going somewhere - but Xander told

560
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,100
me there was nothing for us Xander a

561
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,419
magic toy a wizard that predicts the

562
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,259
future could you say that again your

563
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:18,970
voice became distorted because you were

564
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:25,840
yelling so loud hello hello hello handed

565
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,249
he speaks guess what he predicts in the

566
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,779
winner gets to a special fortune granted

567
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,159
should I pull the plug and grandma's

568
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,889
life support absolutely hmm that seems a

569
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:37,840
little harsh she might pull too you will

570
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,320
get a phone call about this look at this

571
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,119
girl's face she wasn't amazed the phone

572
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,799
rang she's amazed she stayed in this

573
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
room so long with two nutballs listening

574
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,210
to plastic Gandalf it cuts before she

575
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,929
bolts out the room slamming the door

576
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,669
it's ridiculous air for a ridiculous toy

577
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:56,529
and my prediction is this will be found

578
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,499
at a lot of garage sales ask sand are

579
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:09,309
the talking Wizarding they're invading

580
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,169
what seeing how so many of you were

581
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:13,539
triggered by my joy of pokemons being

582
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,730
destroyed safe plays ball protect me

583
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,489
from reality I guess it only makes sense

584
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:20,440
to look at another pokemon commercial

585
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,419
this one's for a product call pokiman

586
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,529
ball busters what's it called pokiman

587
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:32,169
ball busters I can't believe I actually

588
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,850
have another opportunity to play this

589
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:40,720
but to the commercials credit I think

590
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,980
the item is called which isn't a ton

591
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,950
better apparently their popularity is so

592
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,749
amazing even Mickey Mouse has to China

593
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:53,289
yeah whoo wind power blows him away yeah

594
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:55,299
you know just Bob down the hall was the

595
00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:07,989
one who recorded that line away even

596
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,909
Pikachu sounds like he's half-assing it

597
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,760
can they be mastered

598
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,980
shouldn't it be more excited and less

599
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,750
questioning I don't even know what I'm

600
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,510
doing anymore you know I used to play

601
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:32,600
Hamlet at the pokey theatres I hate

602
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,200
everything no there's definitely one kid

603
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,580
that takes this ball thing pretty

604
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,420
seriously

605
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,970
you can put Pokemon power in your pants

606
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,100
not your drawers these suckers are gonna

607
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,690
be blasting my balls all throughout math

608
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,000
class unless you're pokey testicles as a

609
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,710
fetish but if it is we know there's a

610
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,390
hotline they'll take them up on it I

611
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,760
guess it's a pretty standard ad and

612
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,570
there's nothing annoying about it but

613
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,860
it's an okay commercial just don't ask

614
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,420
what makes this kid squirtle cloudy

615
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,900
catchy

616
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,000
pokiman ball busters battle figures

617
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,620
pound bouncers and talking pokemons each

618
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,070
sold separately from Hasbro here's an

619
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,110
old-school one all the way from the 70s

620
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,960
mad a 70s they knew what was sexy back

621
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,510
then Charlie's Angels Wonder Woman long

622
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,910
hair tight pants for all its faults this

623
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,860
is a time period that knew how to be hot

624
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,380
so what's sizzling angle are they taking

625
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,010
up here there's one person nobody can

626
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,560
resist and that's a baby unusual start

627
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,290
so love made baby soft with the innocent

628
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,270
scent of a cuddly clean baby

629
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:49,790
I mean bad body lotion sexiest fragrance

630
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,120
around okay all right I'm Matt Jacob

631
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
from Twilight I don't look at a baby and

632
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,200
imagine them at a bangable age I just

633
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,990
look at them and see a baby that cool

634
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,610
very sexy

635
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,920
loves babies well scaring me right now

636
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,140
because

637
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,080
I never thought of innocence as sexy

638
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,050
because I never wanted to in fact it's

639
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,090
an innocence kind of the opposite of

640
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,280
sexy like the direct opposite if you

641
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,950
look in a dictionary or say let me just

642
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,430
say it say that this feels wrong your

643
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,540
baby wait so now my lover's a baby or

644
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,910
it's actually for babies both are

645
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,560
insanely unsettling I just want to know

646
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,930
what kind of creep I'm dealing with this

647
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,180
is every layer of you I think you can

648
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,640
legally show it's crazy how this starts

649
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,620
off so alluring and quickly turns into

650
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,010
super there's one person nobody can

651
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,200
resist and that's a baby it's hard to

652
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,820
even know what to say why do the most

653
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,770
disturbing commercials always require

654
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,350
babies to be in them does the agency of

655
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,450
creepy ass commercials just meet up and

656
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,730
say not creepy enough specs of babies in
