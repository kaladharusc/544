-Before we get into
&quot;SVU&quot; stuff --

congrats and everything --

00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,104
I want to talk about
Ice-T quickly.

4
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:06,171
I don't know
if you heard this,

5
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:09,809
but there was a big...

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,714
covfefe on Twitter about you
never having a bagel before.

7
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,149
Never...
-Yeah, true.

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,650
-You've never eaten a bagel?

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,519
-I had never eaten a bagel.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,120
I've eaten one
since then.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,922
But what happened was,
on the show,

12
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:23,989
they wanted me
to eat a bagel.

13
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,625
I said,
&quot;I don't eat bagels.&quot;

14
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,626

[ Laughter ]

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,895
But it was in the script.

17
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,130
So, you know,
I just did it.

18
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,932
-Yeah.
-So, then, somebody...

19
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,135
But I acted like I ate it.
I didn't eat it.

20
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,269
So, then, on Twitter,
somebody goes,

21
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:38,571
&quot;Why that kind of bagel?&quot;

22
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,906
I said, &quot;Because it was
in the script.&quot;

23
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,273
Then, they said,
&quot;What's your favorite?&quot;

24
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:42,708
And I said,
&quot;I've never had a bagel.&quot;

25
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,944
And then, everybody lost
their Goddamn mind.

27
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:50,216
And then, I said,
&quot;I've never had coffee, either.&quot;

28
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,953
So, I don't know why that's
so hard for people to believe.

29
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,121
-...two weird things.
One is that

30
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,624
you've never had a bagel bef--
-Why?

31

Why? Look. Look.
I'm from South Central.

&quot;Rolling down the street

-You never know.

-That's not how it
happened for me.

37
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,737
It didn't happen
like that for me.

-I understand.

39
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,775
But through your life,
you've been on sets.

00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,277
I'm assuming there's food
on the sets.

41
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,545
-There's a lot of stuff
I won't eat on the set.

42
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:21,847
I just never ate one.
So, I ate one the other day.

00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:24,384
I did an actual commercial
for a dating site

called &quot;Coffee Meets Bagel,&quot;
or something.

And -- and --
and basically, I ate one.

46
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,824
And it tasted like --
one bite,

47
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,626

a loaf of bread.

I'm okay with it.
Coffee's cool.

but I'm interested in this.

What's your thought
on coffee?

00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,411
Just so we don't have to ever
talk about it again,
what was your thoughts --

58
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,779
-Black coffee --
why would someone

do that to themselves? Okay?
