1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,850
now I I was in a bit of a I was in a bit

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,650
of an exploratory mood on the internet

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,480
just yesterday which I want to do and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,670
usually that leads me to town roads of

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,639
bizarre versions of porn but last night

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,590
I went down a road where I was looking

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,070
into computer learning machine learning

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,840
neural network simulation stuff like

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,020
that yada yada yada ya ski blabbity flee

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,570
but it blow buddy blow and what i found

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,490
was this cool game that kind of

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,669
simulates the idea of this nonsense here

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,350
i found this game and it's called

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,329
evolution what you do in this game is

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,850
you kind of build your own version of a

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,329
creature and you give it muscles and

17
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,050
bones and joints and basically you just

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,329
kind of see what it can do and you can

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,610
judge by how many how many of the

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,610
population you want like how how

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,039
complicated your neural network is gonna

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,430
be I don't know I don't even know but in

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,660
the at the end of the day you've got

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,879
this creature that has the ability this

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,700
creature is not gonna go anywhere is it

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,820
huh

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,439
yeah whatever we'll see what happens so

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,000
you just got this creature and then it

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,340
randomly determines like what it's cold

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,950
god that one's doing good going the

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,360
wrong way oh look at him look at him go

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,580
see and so it takes the best of the last

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,170
generation and then it kind of is like

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,560
yeah that one wasn't so shit oh god why

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,350
no that's that can't be the winner oh no

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,329
that is the winner and then it takes the

37
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,799
winner from the last one and it's like

38
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,930
no this is what we're gonna do god

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,659
dammit well that's not walking that's

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,820
flopping on your ass so yeah this is the

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,329
game so you generally just kind of go

42
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,070
through it waiting for these guys to

43
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,479
eventually get better and better and

44
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,979
with each generation we're on the fifth

45
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,159
generation now you kind of just like

46
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,170
it's there we go that's a winner right

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,759
there see the other one was just no

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,380
progress to be had but this one's

49
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,390
actually walking no that's the wrong way

50
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,040
you idiot god damn it this stupid pieces

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,869
yeah it's it's like you're just watching

52
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,180
your children go flop around in the yard

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,369
for a few hours and like hopefully one

54
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,289
of them actually learns to walk and then

55
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,370
the strongest survives and you you

56
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,790
that to breed more the the children

57
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,980
analogy was not correct on this one the

58
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,590
lag this is awful what a fucking lag I

59
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,870
my streams doing great ain't nothing

60
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,909
wrong with my look I'm simulating life

61
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:28,090
here this is life and there's no lag it

62
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,500
when it comes down to life look at these

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,569
bad boys see more and more of my

64
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:37,090
precious spawn more and more of my

65
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,940
precious precious children are finding

66
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,280
their way through the world trying to

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,900
get better and better look at that over

68
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,150
a cheat oh well you got some competition

69
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,510
oh my god you are so goddamn good and

70
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,459
see look at flappy over there and

71
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,629
eventually you'll get something that

72
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,819
kind of looks a little bit like walking

73
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,769
because the only objective is to go

74
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,690
farther right so it's it's like it

75
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,640
determines what its gonna do based on

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,409
how far it can go now the only

77
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:06,849
complicated thing is I didn't exactly

78
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,650
give it a lot to work with I think there

79
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,180
might be a limit here because I don't

80
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,250
know how it can make locomotion with

81
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,470
just this simple joint thing going on -

82
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,060
see it's not it's got no traction on

83
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,590
there so they're trying to do something

84
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,690
but it ain't working so this is my fault

85
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,319
the the seed was bad therefore the

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,540
yielding result ain't so good either now

87
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,069
I'm sure there's some way to get it out

88
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,959
of here but this ain't uh this ain't

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,750
good I ain't too proud of dad here no no

90
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,790
I ain't proud daddy or you get you get

91
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,980
the fuck out of you freaks all right so

92
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,449
the problem obviously was the problem

93
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,970
obviously was that they didn't look a

94
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,840
thing like me we're gonna make me I'm

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,220
gonna make a man out of you this is not

96
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,530
gonna go well and then just a stick for

97
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,780
a head cuz I don't think you deserve to

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,940
have a full head going on there in fact

99
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,470
I don't know why I made so many joints

100
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,419
on the arms I'm just gonna delete these

101
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,310
no the thing I've learned playing around

102
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,379
with this is best to start out as simple

103
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,720
as possible because if you don't you're

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,629
gonna have a bad time all right

105
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:19,150
go my demon children go go my dear go go

106
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,940
my demon children husband stand it up

107
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,580
hey good job there well done for you

108
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,080
well done you pile

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,310
sticks oh good I love seeing the best of

110
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,949
generation one he's doing leg raises

111
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,550
where did you go oh yeah you got um yeah

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,830
you got this and then you just watch it

113
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,740
for a long long time until it eventually

114
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,780
figures out that leg raises aren't the

115
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,190
best thing that you can do you gotta

116
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,560
eventually stand your self beyond look

117
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,870
at that guy hey oh damn you man / look

118
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,030
at us man pers oh no spammer made it

119
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,319
this man / did good

120
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,530
maybe yes man / did a little good almost

121
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,900
something in the way of resembling

122
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,680
walking Oh hippity hoppity hip hop

123
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,110
hippity hop hop hippity hoppity come on

124
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,810
oh you you piece of shit this man Bert

125
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,800
nice man perfect whoa whoa did you see

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,729
that whoa what the hell oh they're

127
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,699
fucking oh no no hey whoa hey this is a

128
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,610
family-friendly channel guys got guys

129
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,300
guys oh god I didn't want any of this

130
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,819
happen I was trying to make it so that

131
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,250
this would be educational educational at

132
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,930
best and yet it's turned into something

133
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,029
along the lines of this now now all I

134
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,590
can see when I look at this is just like

135
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,680
it's some big orgy going on and this is

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,599
how they keep getting batches of 50 for

137
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:57,750
the next generation so quickly is this

138
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,129
breakdancing I love it so it takes a

139
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,560
long time to work out something in the

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,590
semblance of not horrifying and not

141
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,219
yucky

142
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,729
and this is both horrifying and whew

143
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,729
oh my god they're starting to walk it's

144
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,879
starting oh man we got we got

145
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,849
competition up in the walking's yeah you

146
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,610
go you got it yeah you got it oh man

147
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,750
they're walking that's how they learned

148
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,849
out of sex standing up this is like if

149
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,889
babies were somehow fully grown adults

150
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,469
the second they shot out of the womb I

151
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:34,839
imagine all this sounds like emanating

152
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,540
from this pile just the

153
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,590
but times 50 I'm more Slurpee like just

154
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,620
a lot of that noise going on I am NOT a

155
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,750
proud papa I am not but you can see

156
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,180
we're in generation 24 right now and

157
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,270
they're starting to walk which is a bad

158
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,660
prospect so much but fuckin I don't even

159
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,090
know if these things have butts I don't

160
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,740
even know if these things have a nooses

161
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,210
Oh Oh God oh my god it's just like like

162
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,430
occasionally might my brain Oh like like

163
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,020
look at that it's like that's some

164
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,000
horrible SCP monster just something with

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,190
like a way too many hands way too many

166
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,020
limbs and all moving in a coordinated

167
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:28,420
like horrifying fashion like that yeah

168
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,280
it's pretty much how the world end just

169
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,170
imagine all these with a like each of

170
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,450
them having my face on them they take

171
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,700
after their papa just cloned myself a

172
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,440
million times there's the end result of

173
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,120
the horrifying cloning oh they're

174
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,890
beautiful

175
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,410
and this is the 46 generations it took

176
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,900
46 generations of not knowing anything

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,210
about coordinated movement not knowing

178
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,700
anything about trying to go from A to B

179
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,650
it didn't know shit about that that's

180
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,860
not what it knew so it just took bones

181
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,050
joints muscles and it basically just

182
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,870
threw a bunch of attempts through random

183
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,750
chance and the only objective is getting

184
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,420
farther and from that I have input

185
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,820
nothing I have done nothing to these I

186
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,350
have taught them nothing you think I

187
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,210
taught them that I didn't teach them

188
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,820
that horrifying zombie shambling walk

189
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,680
this is what they figured out on their

190
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,450
own and this is like what it's like a

191
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,730
what a lot of like game development AI

192
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,530
development stuff like that is kind of

193
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,080
proving is like the concept of AI

194
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
figuring shit out kind of like this

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,280
evolutionary process of like neural

196
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,280
thing it's not complicated it really is

197
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,310
not complicated it's just like trial and

198
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,700
error over generation after generation

199
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,450
millions and millions of generations

200
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,760
it's kind of just trial and error and so

201
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,010
when it comes down to games

202
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,390
it's like fascinating to see that things

203
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,250
can just be procedurally made like this

204
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,160
and

205
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,050
and adapt after that yeah it makes you

206
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,730
terrified for the future donut the

207
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,230
majority of them have figured out how to

208
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,110
walk but uh they're steadily steadily

209
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,759
getting faster the ones that fall at the

210
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,769
beginning they have a mutation that that

211
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,509
actually worked against them because

212
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,129
there's mutations like with random

213
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,810
chance and random mutations sometimes it

214
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,100
works against them like they fall

215
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,990
sometimes it works for them and they go

216
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,550
faster and then they got this horrible

217
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,180
shambling whoa well I think that's about

218
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,500
as good as this one's gonna get so we

219
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,269
got to make a new one so this is my

220
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,399
horrible children my parting words see

221
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,329
you are go away and get off my lawn I

222
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,620
hate you and I wish you were gone

223
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,149
farewell and forever go away anyway see

224
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,649
ya alright so let's uh let's forget

225
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,689
about this horrible monstrosity we can

226
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,990
also like put like a basic one but we

227
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:48,500
can also get obstacle oh is it like

228
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,329
which one gets highest when the obstacle

229
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,019
goes over what about climbing hailer

230
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:59,380
whoa I forgot I built this one oh yeah

231
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,949
why did I call this one idea you know

232
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:05,720
every I remember there was a problem

233
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,459
here a structural integrity was a bit of

234
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,889
an issue also I remembered this this is

235
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,660
a problem right here it's chica it's

236
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:22,220
chicken how are you good girl oh god I

237
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,019
forgot to put you on the stand oh god I

238
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,449
forgot I made fifty of you more

239
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,100
complicated they are the harder they are

240
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,720
to um this is good ten of you I don't

241
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
think you're gonna be good at climbing

242
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:41,840
up the stairwell okay nope this is sad

243
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:54,620
oh wow Wow see that's how quickly they

244
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:02,660
can learn not to fall to their do take

245
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,770
oh god oh no all of oh no they've lost

246
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,330
all progress because now they're just

247
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,170
falling again

248
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,130
oh no well that's not good I imagine

249
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,700
like a complicated thing like this is

250
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,430
gonna be a lot more challenging than say

251
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,370
trying to just walk forwards I don't

252
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,440
know how in the world they're gonna be

253
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,540
able to climb up these stairs I don't

254
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,070
know how many generations would take cuz

255
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,590
they've already forgotten how to hold on

256
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,320
for dear life but any evolution off of

257
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,760
that would just like cause chaos I

258
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,600
imagine and so yeah they're having a

259
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,730
rough day they're generally kind of

260
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,040
slowing down they're generally kind of

261
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,690
slowing down and I'm actually impressed

262
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,700
by that that tails causing issues I

263
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
don't think it's a tail the tails

264
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,180
actually like holding them in place if

265
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,130
you look at the small little indentation

266
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,720
there when it looks at the best one it's

267
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,950
actually like the ones that are most

268
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,990
successful or because the tail acts as

269
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,060
like a brace even though the tail is

270
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,650
weighing them down and like tossing them

271
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,480
backwards I think they would fall anyway

272
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,070
like some of them are using that tail

273
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,200
over their advantage maybe not I don't

274
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
think you know as much as I'm I'm a

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,370
proud papa chica I don't think chica was

276
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,740
cut out - maybe no I think actually

277
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,810
maybe the tail is causing issues let's

278
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,760
just make the tail a little bit higher

279
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,820
up she's happy like my wet or I'm a

280
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,090
happy puppy let's scooch her in nice but

281
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,020
they're cheeky

282
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,580
all right let's scoot your in a bit

283
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,830
she's got a thicker neck than that let's

284
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,530
put her snore fur right there we go

285
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,220
that's looking a bit more cheek ask

286
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,480
she doesn't never wear to hump in her

287
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,740
back there we go there we go that's that

288
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,600
looks like a chica

289
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
order on the dáil there all right chica

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,940
you cook climb those stairs you're gonna

291
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,269
kill it they're gonna get it I'm so

292
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,399
proud of you I'm gonna give you another

293
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,250
bone there give you another bone here

294
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,290
just for structural stability

295
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,529
I like being stable dad I know you do

296
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,560
chica I am well aware that you like

297
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,470
stability above all else all right let's

298
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:21,740
try it oh boy she's fast I gotta give it

299
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,040
to her she's and she's I'm trying to

300
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,910
Train chica and all of her ill-begotten

301
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,660
spawn she's doing her best she's trying

302
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,970
real hard she wants to succeed and she

303
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,350
will is eventually I think the problem

304
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,810
is she has no mechanism by which to go

305
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,089
higher the best that she can hope for is

306
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,220
just to stay Stockstill and I think

307
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,930
that's what the evolution of this is

308
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,430
just gonna do and that's her natural

309
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,740
response into crisis situations is to

310
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,860
freeze absolutely freeze in place and I

311
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,079
think like I think that's I think that's

312
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,880
true to life I think if anything is true

313
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,500
to life that is in fact true to life all

314
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,149
right let's get her who's gonna run in

315
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,339
the get her in an open field and running

316
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,769
go chica go um I think the muscles in

317
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,259
her face ain't doing her any it's really

318
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:42,560
her she's so frozen

319
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:53,520
[Laughter]

320
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:01,300
[Music]

321
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:09,410
go chica go go go go go go go go go this

322
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,180
is the definition of baby steps right

323
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,370
here because one of they're making very

324
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,410
little progress but they're making

325
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,690
progress I think I think the problem is

326
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,550
what I got to do I think I got to make

327
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,470
like a muscle that bridges the gap here

328
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,980
because and that's not normal I know I

329
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,050
know it's not normal and let me make a

330
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,910
counterbalance tale a little longer

331
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,010
she's happier or she's about to shoot

332
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,230
poop out of her butthole there we go now

333
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,510
we've got something now we've got

334
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,270
something now we're getting somewhere

335
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:46,490
now we've oh wow that was pretty

336
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,920
impressive I've had I've had one where

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,950
oh god its evolution is like based on a

338
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,480
glitch and I think this is gonna be one

339
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,850
of those things where it's like it's for

340
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,260
burgers and just because it glitched out

341
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,690
super-hard yeah oh it's gonna be one of

342
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,840
the sheikah no don't tap into the dark

343
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,210
under all the power chica don't do it

344
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,480
chica no oh god she's doing it she's

345
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,090
tapping into her unknown powers from a

346
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,030
dimension beyond dollars there's no way

347
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,950
that will ever survive the repercussions

348
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,170
or whatever this is leading towards it's

349
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,420
dark cheek well good job girl wait Oh

350
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,630
way to go you know eventually this is

351
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,220
gonna turn out to be like really

352
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,890
impressive but at the moment it's quite

353
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,730
perturbing I got it marked chicas in the

354
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,710
upset yeah something like that

355
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,400
Oh same as ever

356
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,740
yes one went way high oh there she good

357
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,750
thing that's the winning generation just

358
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:01,140
ball good girl she's such a good girl

359
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,530
she our face she's such a good girl look

360
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,460
at her go

361
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,080
oh she's really fighting there she go oh

362
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,860
she's trying to learn how to do a

363
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,690
backflip I think I think that's her

364
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,040
objective here is basically the game but

365
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,630
I don't think cheek is gonna get very

366
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,910
far so what I want to do what I want to

367
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,620
do is I want to get a creature that's

368
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,589
actually gonna go far and I think like

369
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,350
the best ones are spider based they're

370
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:41,730
like these horrible well spiders it just

371
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,770
looks like one big spider hang on I

372
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,150
gotta go back I gotta make a bigger

373
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:53,580
bigger generation pool for more I'm

374
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,950
gonna go back to ten I was gonna keep it

375
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,170
to ten eventually we're gonna get to

376
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,760
Spider Man here but you know we got

377
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,010
evolutions baby steps you gotta yeah to

378
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,170
make it as far as you can see what's

379
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,990
weird is like it looks the when this is

380
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,020
happening it looks natural eventually

381
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,470
even the failures kind of look natural

382
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,540
it's just it's bizarre in the way that

383
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,830
yes it kinda is natural because this

384
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,540
it's just trying to move based in a

385
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,420
world of physics and as a limited world

386
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,830
of physics but yeah it's trying to move

387
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,650
and it's working why is it working

388
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,500
arachnophobia intensifies yeah kinda

389
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,060
it's like a bunch of baby spiders just

390
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,770
shooting out of the baby spider womb

391
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,110
because spiders give live birth I think

392
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,970
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure they go

393
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,530
into labor and then they shoot out and

394
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,700
then they just do this for a little bit

395
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,930
until they can figure out how to

396
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,970
they lay eggs I don't think that's right

397
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,890
I don't think that's right at all

398
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,570
I don't think spiders lay eggs that

399
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,310
doesn't make any sense at all I'm pretty

400
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,910
sure when a daddy spider a daddy spider

401
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,120
loves a mommy spider the daddy spiders

402
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
penis will get erect and then he will

403
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,010
insert it into the mommy spiders vagina

404
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,680
and then nine months later it comes out

405
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,990
a bunch about a thousand spider babies

406
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,140
like a shotgun like a like that right at

407
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,020
your face just like the spider mom when

408
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,670
she's about to give birth she goes seeks

409
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,190
out the nearest face because spider moms

410
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,780
can recognize that when they're about to

411
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:32,240
give birth and then they just like aim

412
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,470
and then you've got thousands of these

413
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,590
little things trying to eat your entire

414
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,100
face so to recap daddy spider wink wink

415
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,410
wink wink wink II loves mommy spider

416
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,430
daddy spider penis erect and then into

417
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,150
mommy spider ah and then spiders give

418
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,730
birth like a shotgun blast into the

419
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,530
nearest face I'm pretty sure that's

420
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,150
correct no I don't even bother looking

421
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,800
it up because that is exactly what

422
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,300
happens I am a hundred percent positive

423
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,400
about that you don't even need to ask

424
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,010
your teachers when you see them next

425
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,830
they will confirm this is how spiders

426
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,930
reproduce then what's the eggs hanging

427
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,470
from your basement ceiling you have no

428
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,630
idea I don't know what they could be and

429
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,490
in fact I'm pretty sure your parents are

430
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,780
hiding something from you if you've got

431
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,480
weird what you may think is a spider egg

432
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,130
hanging from your ceiling there's been

433
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,230
animal science 101 with Marv but this is

434
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,410
this got to be at least 301 or 302 at

435
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,120
the very minimum you got to give me that

436
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,010
I know my shit when it comes to animal

437
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,710
reproduction ask me any animal combo I

438
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,840
can tell you what how when and where

439
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
they reproduce and where they shoot

440
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,680
their babies once they shoot him out of

441
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,840
there whatever vagina they have ask me

442
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,180
anything I got this can spiders double

443
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,080
pump absolutely 100% platypus

444
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,140
platypi don't reproduce it's always the

445
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,330
same platypus from the beginning of

446
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,610
platypus time to the end of platypus

447
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,210
time

448
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,539
have you ever seen a platypus die no

449
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,369
think so never seen a platypus get old

450
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,859
no didn't think so yeah it's always the

451
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,190
same one cat and cow I think we can all

452
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,259
imagine what that looks like and anyway

453
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,639
I was asking more in a hypothetical

454
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,289
sense I don't actually want to know what

455
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,009
you're talking about

456
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,080
also why is a spider not actually doing

457
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,729
anything the spider seems to have fallen

458
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:18,619
into an evolutionary trap where it's not

459
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,019
making any progress no no it was a

460
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,119
hypothetical question all you perverts

461
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,710
that want to see a hamster fucking

462
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,749
elephant you guys are fucking weird and

463
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:29,629
disgusting you are disgusting because

464
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,059
that just ain't right like that's that's

465
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,220
not right at all number one the elephant

466
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,409
would kill the hamster probably straight

467
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,509
up and that's horrible in and of itself

468
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,029
but even if they succeeded like you want

469
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,649
to see some fucked up shit and that's

470
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:44,779
not what I uh I'm not about that

471
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,749
where's the spore you know this kind of

472
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,309
like what spores about but spore they

473
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,690
don't actually figure out what they're

474
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,369
doing spore they just know what they're

475
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,989
doing from the get-go which i think is

476
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:56,779
boring I think in Spore they shouldn't

477
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,159
know what they're doing from the get-go

478
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,899
and they should figure it out just like

479
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,239
this because that's more interesting in

480
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,950
my opinion because what if they were

481
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,019
also going through their social dynamics

482
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,669
bullshit well I'll try to figure this

483
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,470
shit out I don't think it'll work out as

484
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,840
nicely mark this is horrifying well it

485
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,239
is spook Tober orc october depending on

486
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,769
what you subscribe to what do you think

00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,789
strawpoll that'll solve it okay that I

509
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:17,260
think that's the only thing that can

510
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,789
solve it are hang on let's see which is

511
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:27,100
it spooped Ober or October there we go

512
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,029
easy okay there we go I did it I got it

513
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,510

514
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,179
okay what's the results that's what I

515
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,919
thought oh wait no that's not in my

516
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,830
favor I thought it was in my favor but

517
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,500
it is an even 60/40 split if we could

518
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,779
get that up to a 69 split I'd really

519
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,220
appreciate it guys you got to get one of

520
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,289
those numbers to 69 percent I don't care

521
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,809
which one but in this poll you have to

522
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,639
get it to 69 percent that's the only

523
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,159
thing that you have to do no that's the

524
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,320
wrong way you guys suck

525
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,659
come on get it to 69 percent you got it

526
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:00,909
I don't care which one it is get one of

527
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,639
those numbers to 69 or vote for spooked

528
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,919
Ober just cuz I guess you can't see the

529
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,049
numbers so I guess I'm gonna do whatever

530
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,860
whatever you know what I don't

531
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,480
understand how the internet works I

532
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,760
don't understand how polls work and

533
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,710
apparently I don't understand how cock

534
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,309
Tober works so the ant the result is 60%

535
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,269
for spooked over 40% Fork October I

536
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,179
guess I've lost this spider is just a

537
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:30,039
dumb piece of shit that's fallen into a

538
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,679
loop of stupidity and we've got nothing

539
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,750
okay so what I'm gonna do we're gonna do

540
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,950
one last thing I'm gonna I'm gonna

541
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,309
create magic okay all right we're gonna

542
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,649
zoom out because we're gonna need a lot

543
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:46,720
of space for this one everybody hold a

544
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,850
shot up hang on hold on I got this it's

545
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,309
not a penis of course it's not a penis

546
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:53,380
what's wrong with you yeah here we go

547
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,000
okay all right

548
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,840
hush hush hush you have no idea what's

549
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,519
happening right now yeah I gotta leave

550
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,769
is real quick cuz I gotta put a joint

551
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,070
here for the sake of what I'm about to

552
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:12,279
do which is glasses there we go

553
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:16,080
well that looks what I would call good

554
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,489
looks like he's looking up like yeah

555
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:25,450
definitely definitely good oh god now

556
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,249
I've ruined it I've ruined it I can't be

557
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:28,719
like this I got to find a way to be a

558
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:32,019
little more subtle about this there we

559
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:49,769
go alright yep that's oh boy yo homie no

560
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:53,859
yoy me no way so nicely defined cheeks

561
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,739
oh he's got a butt chin I figured just

562
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,469
for stability I have to have like these

563
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:02,049
here cuz otherwise this is gonna dangle

564
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:05,079
or maybe I want that maybe I want just a

565
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,759
little bit of dangle nobody said I

566
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,039
didn't like no dangle right okay I don't

567
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,719
know how this is gonna work well let's

568
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:15,659
see what happens Oh

569
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,789
turns out structural integrity was a bit

570
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,589
of an issue gonna get a little more

571
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,599
stable and it's gotta be a little more

572
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,489
stable it's gonna lose a bit of the the

573
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:26,709
beauty the beauty is gonna be gone a bit

574
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,570
but I think it's gonna be worth it in

575
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,179
the long run cuz we got a we've got to

576
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:33,820
make some sacrifices here that still

577
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,200
looks that still looks definitely still

578
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:46,570
looks oh yeah that that looks oh that

579
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,129
doesn't work at all hang it I think we

580
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:50,139
got to get some more muscle in here just

581
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,459
to increase the rigidity of it I like

582
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,780
rigidity

583
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,590
uh-huh this is gonna probably work yes

584
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,010
yeah yeah that looks nope horrible turns

585
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,990
up it's horrible turns out it doesn't

586
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,600
work and it's horrible okay I think it

587
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,340
needs more leg usually in my experience

588
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,190
when something ain't working right more

589
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:25,300
leg yeah this is gonna be the one all

590
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,070
right there we go that's just really

591
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:34,780
good Oh God oh good Hey look at the best

592
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,060
of generation one it actually looks like

593
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,310
what it's supposed to look like

594
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,960
amazingly up now don't oh that's

595
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,710
horrible that's not good I don't like

596
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,130
how that worked

597
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,090
oh you know what I did wrong ah man I

598
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,980
I've made this mistake before you can't

599
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,830
put because these can these can contract

600
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,560
and expand so you got to be careful with

601
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,230
putting um too many on there that's

602
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,810
right because I don't want them to

603
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,510
contract and expand too much here we go

604
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,160
that's worse it's worse it's gotten

605
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:31,270
worse bag of mush now okay I think also

606
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm gonna remove because I don't think

607
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,280
these muscles inside here are doing us

608
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,260
any good so I'm just gonna take out all

609
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,390
the interior muscles cuz I think there's

610
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,620
just too much control of the creature of

611
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,110
the Larry here from the inside and I

612
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,450
definitely don't it didn't help no

613
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,720
didn't help he's buggin out oh boy Larry

619
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,490
tall man as tall as you can plainly see

620
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,240
he's quite tall and that is obvious but

621
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,040
now he needs arms very dangly arms and

622

gonna be less sexual than this but it

639
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,450
seems like it's the only thing they know

640
