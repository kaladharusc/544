thank you nice you the reason why I'm at

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,560
buffer fest this year is because Samsung

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,830
is a sponsor of a buffer fest and you

39
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,600
know I can't a lot of for the amount

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
that I work with Samsung but what I like

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,040
about Samsung is that their mission as a

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,050
company at least the exposure out hi to

43
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,910
them as a company is about enabling

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,180
creators so Samsung is sponsoring buffer

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,650
fest like they're helping put this big

46
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,230

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,730
