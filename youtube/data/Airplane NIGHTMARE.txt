2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,450

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:26,390

4
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,019
very exciting very full day today a lot going on

5
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,270
today's exciting this is one of those days where I have all this stuff to

6
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,540
cream and then i have to get into a car and you're the airport and then I have

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,890
to fly away

8
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,890
so it's like two days in one day

9
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,550

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,159
I do need to get out of here i am running late but look at all these

20
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,159
packages

21
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,620
I could be like a two-second mail time

22
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,720
a rugged coffee maker

23
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,260
where'd this come from

24
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,550
whoever sent me to rugged coffee makers thank you yes

25
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:26,220
why rip surf

26
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,470
I don't know what this is it looks like some sort of surf board skateboard

27
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,459
thank you

28
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,819
oh yeah

29
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,819
so nice

30
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,560
a suitcase

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:58,010
nice suitcase thank you for the suitcase three packages three cool things that no

32
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,010
letters under your nose

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,319
a letter

34
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,980
- Casey thanks for taking the time to read this letter thanks for taking the

35
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,909
time to write it

36
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,269
inside you'll find something I personally created from looking forward

37
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,889
crazy job

38
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,209
all right crazy Joe crazy Joe

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,129
I appreciate this but i can't show this to my heart this is a ring holder and

40
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,430
then what that literally means if you wear a ring you hang it on this now I'm

41
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,799
going to pixelate it but try to use your best imagination as to what this is it's

42
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,079
a muscle man flexing his muscles see which part is pixelated in real life

43
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,799
it's anatomically correct thanks crazy Joe

44
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,340
I gotta get out of here

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,120
don't want to always wait till the last minute to pack

46
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,949
the key to packing a drone is to pack it upside down and then bury it with

47
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,910
clothes

48
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,870
so when the inspectors see it from above they just see this weird-looking camera

49
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,870
thing and it raises a lot less suspicions

50
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,930
tell me more turtle ate chocolate

51
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,110
yeah be comfortable thank you

52
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,880
hey long drive go how long it's gonna take us what's traffic say they're

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,300
talking about 50 to 55 meeting I can handle that

54
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,110
you know how long it takes to get to JFK in a helicopter

55
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,290
I told six-minute 66 minutes

56
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,330
no traffic guarantee there goes my helicopter from here

57
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,330
right right there a lot of fun

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,730
I was sound asleep for most of that ride yeah

59
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,450
when you wake up you're picking the feature

60
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,450
yeah enjoy

61
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,590
all right I literally was sound asleep the entire out cold

62
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,120
all right thank you very much check it out thank you

63
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,880
take care like all right I've got a new all-time greatest super driver

64
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,470
that guy was amazing such a ray of sunshine do I have a window seat and

65
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,470
I'll see all right thank you very much

66
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,499
because traffic was so that it took us forever to get here

67
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:17,550
I've got no time to dilly-dally here in the airport and take a shower put on my

68
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,069
pajamas gotta get on the plane

69
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,069
15

70
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,510
my flight just got delayed three hours

71
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,990
american airlines what the discus shower

72
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,990
I'm ready for my sleep and just a little . the lounge

73
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,150
flights delayed

74
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,560
super quick travel Q&A let's do 51 seconds on the clock

75
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,580
have you ever had a slight that make you nervous or scared

76
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,030
the only place I've ever been scared on what I was flying into Afghanistan and

77
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,070
we had to find a circle like this and when I asked why is because it's harder

78
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,970
to be targeted

79
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,930
if you're landing like this versus landing like this something like that

80
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,280
that was terrifying

81
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,130
window or aisle window always favored sweatpants to fly and my favorite are my

82
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,180
skeleton one because I really loves them but they're not the most comfortable

83
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,590
the most comfortable are disposable ones 10 walmart flight five bucks he just

84
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,389
thought after you wear them once

85
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,860
why do you travel mostly without fancy and Candice have you ever traveled with

86
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,550
the baby

87
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,060
I travel for business and traveling for business with a family is like

88
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,500
impossible

89
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
favorite airplane food the cookies one hundred percent

90
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,000

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
