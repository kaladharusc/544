That's right, today we're going to discuss GIFs and why you're a complete low degenerate scumbag for using them.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,960
mmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMM

(Failed)

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,380
First thing you need to know about GIFs is that it's an acronym for:

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,500
God

24

I added the last bit, just kidding guys. It's actually an acronym for:

Graphic Inter-change Formats

29
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,540
Hmm, interesting.

30
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,140
And second of all, more importantly, it's pronounced &quot;gif&quot;. Okay, if you're calling a &quot;jif...&quot;

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,340
I don't know what to tell you. There must be something wrong with you. Are you straight-up loco?

(Angry 12 year-old voice) But Felix

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,440
The creator of GIFs calls them &quot;jif&quot;s so it has to be right to pronounce them &quot;jif&quot;s-

SSHHTTFFKKFF

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,760
Oh, okay, so just because you invented something means you're the literary scholar of how it's pronounced

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,620

Huh? Because the inventor of &quot;KARLH&quot;s pronounced it &quot;KCH&quot;

39
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,420
Stupid. Makes zero sense. You're as dumb as you look if you think that way.

Because Dr. ThioJoe is going to lay down some righteous knowledge on you.

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,840
It's &quot;jif.&quot;

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,980
It's pronounced &quot;jif,&quot; and you know what? I'm not even saying it's

57
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,400
because that's the way the creator says it, that's not even a factor, just ignore that altogether.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,220
&quot;There is no 'J' in 'jif,' there's no reason to pronounce it like that!&quot;

[triggered sounds]

68
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,420
Let's see what other dumb arguments we have

69
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,180
Yeah, you lobotomize

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,960
There's about 1 million words in the English language and statistically

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,580
about 1.95% of them begin with a G, that's

72
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,020
19,500 words that begin with a G. On Wikipedia there's an article that's literally a list of words

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,140
where a hard G is used instead of a soft G

74
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,320
So the fact that you can actually create an article small enough to list them should clue you in a bit. Okay well

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,600
Okay, well let's examine that article.

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,780
Here's the same article, I found it, a list of English words where G is pronounced

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,780
exceptionally. Oh look, gif is in there! (*oof*-ing destroyed)

78

Wow, what a great article that you sourced, wow, that really proved your point really well, didn't it?

79
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,840
???

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:56,280
There are 61 words on that list, let's even round it up to a hundred. A hundred out of 19,500 is 0.5%.

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,560
So you would rather argue that jiff is the exception to a rule that's followed

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,320
99.5% of the time instead of admitting that you never looked up the grammar rule in the first place.

83
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,760
*angry pewds* oh, just because statistically

84
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,220
it's less likely to be pronounced some way means that it is pronounced that way.

85
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,240
Yeah, that definitely makes sense. According to that logic,

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,140
all these words should be pronounced jecko, jeek, jeese

87
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,760
It's the same idea, right? Now &quot;it's less likely to pronounce that way&quot; you JOOFUS,

91
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,000
&quot;Well it stands for graphics interchange format so the G must be hard!&quot;

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,220
This is such a stupid argument that it instantly makes you sound like an idiot.

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,520
No it doesn't, shut up.

94
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,300
I made a poll on Twitter to see what you guys thought was the best way to pronounce it

95
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,280
Oh look, most of you think it's pronounced with a hard G. So that means statistically

96
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,240
it's correct, right? And, of course,

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,820
Wikipedia is the most trusted site of all time to get your sources from

98
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,520
What if we look up gif in an actual dic(k)tionary?

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,420
Oh look. What's the first thing that shows up? Gif with a hard G.

100
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,140
Wow, that really sure was hard, wasn't it?

101

Sure glad we got that settled

Now let's move on to the actual issue of the gifs

104
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,680
Gifs have been around for a very long time, over 25 years

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,260
It started off as cute little baby dancing.

106

Wow look at that, that's-you remember that one? (sure do)

(again with that *oof*-ing fake laughter)

109
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,060
How about the peanut butter jelly banana that was funny, right?

110
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,900
Gifs used to be so cute and so innocent

111
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,340
Look at this, they were used to make websites look good (oh god why)

112
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,340
I remember I made a website just adding a bunch of gifs

113
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,860

114
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,300
Oh look at all these great butterflies!

115
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,820
You don't see gifs like that anymore, you just don't.

116
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,480
Look at the amazing frame rate of this one, wow, it's like I'm truly there.

117
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,800
Love Star Wars gifs, they're the best.

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,820
Well now, guess what it is now. It's cancer, it's just cancer.

119
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,530
So much cancer. If you posted a gif in the last 7 days

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,160
I know what you're thinking, how did we go from this

123
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,100
to this?

124
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,560

126

Nothing like a good reaction gif, right?

127
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,880
But you've probably noticed most popular ones are of black people being dramatic.

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
This (is not digital blackface)

129
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,500
is free real estate

130

T I M E  T O  S T O P

132
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,870
I don't understand why people are so fun of using gifs. They're not funny

133
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,889
They rarely are funny, or even chuckle worthy

134
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,580
But it's still, they're spread around everywhere, like a disease.

135
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,780
I tried myself to look up some cringy examples of people using gifs

136
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,520
and the only thing that showed up was people cringing.

137
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,480
Which is cringy in itself.

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,440
You are what you're trying to portray that you're against.

139
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,380
WAKE UP

140
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,640
Sharing a gif of you cringing is cringy

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040

142

Can't believe this, my own GF

144
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,980
(Marzia) You mean your own GIF?

145
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,720
(pun worthy of eyeroll)

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
GO

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,680
It's time to stop

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,520
Do you know why gifs are so popular? Because of the toilet of the internet

149
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,540
No I'm not talking about my channel, I'm talking about tumblr

150
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,420
It's as if you need at least ten images at all times to stimulate your brain

00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,140
to distract you from the fact that you are an angsty depressed teenager, that's tumblr essentially

152
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,900
Congratulations everyone.

153
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,940
When someone greets you by name, and you don't recognize them

154
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,300
(holy heck that was soo fricking funny I'm ROFLMAO'ing on the floor right now)

155
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,780
[weird grunts]

156
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,240
When you're seated between two people who are fighting

157
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,960
(gif speeds up in an attempt to make it funny)

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,460
If this was what YLYL would look like, the internet would be a sad place, even sadder than it is now

159
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,100
So relatable oh my *gawd*

160
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,440
When you unexpectedly run into a friend you just heard a rumor about

161
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,500
*about to lose his will to live*

162
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,220
Do you have any form of character by yourself?

163
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,940
Do you really need celebrities to portray your emotions and words?

164
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,020
You literally you're just so empty

165
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,100
that you can't even express yourself without using the image in a video (incoming ear rape)

166
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,760
and a text by someone else.

167
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,440
Now I know it's like an argument that &quot;oh, you're stealing memes and gifs, it's the same thing&quot;

168
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,180
but you're not just stealing the joke. You're stealing the whole character of another person.

169
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,180
It's pathetic

170
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,920
BFT FELFX WF'RF JST HFVING FFN

171

You're not allowed to have fun, not on this channel

172
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,880
*skratta*

173
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,760
Buzzfeed, of course, is also a huge problem to why gifs are so popular

174
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,240
Can you imagine studying for years to become a journalist

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,240
to then work on a new site of writing articles called

176
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,780
&quot;19 Things Even Healthy People Do That Are Actually Bad For You&quot;

177
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,280
(gotta get that capitalization right)

178
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,620
spend up to 75 thousand dollars to get your degree

179
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,020
to then being told &quot;Hey, this is a great article and what you wrote was really great,

180
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,600
but can we just add more pictures of celebrities that are moving in there

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
because your words were just not adequate enough?&quot;

182
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
(pewds making sassy voice) &quot;Ignoring your body and refusing to make doctor appointments&quot;

183
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,820
pfffff sssssss

184
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,360
*DUN* that's just s

185
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,960
If you're not convinced by my ideas why gifs are bad, don't worry.

186
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,100
There are straight-up facts to explain this as well.

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,580
Gifs were originally popular because they were efficient.

188
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,900
Gif uses an image compressing called L Z Wee,

189
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,860
which stands for

190
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,300
LOL ZORZ WOW

191
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,500
Just kidding. Sometimes I just like to make stuff up.

192
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,980
Elzey Wee

193
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,460
It's a lossless compression algorithm that lets you download large image

194
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,400
quickly even if you have a slow bandwidth

195
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,680
???

196
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,000
Great, yes. It was great 20 years ago. Gifs have now been surpassed by its superior

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,460
PEE ENGIE

198
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,580
(little crybabies) &quot;But I want moving images!&quot;

199
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,240
We all know that gits have been around for a very long time, it's an old format

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,320
But now that people popularize it by adding images and moving images to it,

201
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,400
that's when it's become clearly an outdated format.

202
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,120
Don't believe me? I'm gonna link two examples in the description just click on them, alright?

203
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,900
I have a pretty fast internet, and these gifs are not downloading unless

204
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,260
I open them individually, they'll load quicker that way

205
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,060
The reason why the video is quicker than the the gif

206
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,540
is because it's around two megabytes instead of the gif which is 14 megabyte

207
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,320
DAMN DANIEL

208
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,640
The video can also start streaming and doesn't need to download the whole thing to start playing the video

209
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,080
while the gif needs to download the whole file to display properly

210
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
BUT WHY IS THIS?

211
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,020
(confused pewds and an invisible person)

212
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,720
Because of video compression, that's right!

213
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,480
If this setup I have with the camera, for example, takes very little space on your computer

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,960
or at least when on my computer because

215
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,320
Simple background, I'm not moving a lot.

216
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,840
The way the video compression works is that it takes only the images that changes in into account

217
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,380
It doesn't keep having to re-download this background for example

218
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,680
Unless the background changes which leads to a lot less data to be wasted. Yay!

219
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,100
But if you start adding a bunch of stuff moving on the screen, and if I go all crazy

220
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:02,320
And you add a bunch of confetti and stuff you'll quickly see that the quality of the video goes down quite a bit

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,240
But this is how it's possible that we can have so many videos on YouTube and so long. Thank you

222
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,460
Thanks to the efficiency of video compression, so many things are made possible. Hooray!

223
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,760
????

224
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,040
It's also very cool when video compression fails

231
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,960
But pewds, not everyone has bad internet so we don't need to have an efficient model s-&quot;

232
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,560
There's no reason to purposely be inefficient, okay?

233
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,820
There is a better solution. That's right,

234
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,680
HTML5 elements!

235
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,740
AAAAHHHHHHHH

236
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,700
It's got autoplay, it can loop if you want to, look at this beauty

237
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,780
Oh, plays right away even though the whole thing hasn't buffered yet

238
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,680
It has sound, it has volume control

239
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,420
You can pause it, you can choose to loop it if you want to, you can adjust the volume

240
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:25,140
You can easily download it, and you can go fullscreen with it and the coding for it is also very simple

241
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,640
get dunked boi

242
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,720
HTML5 elements everybody!

243
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,300
That's right, gif, you just got schooled, oh snap!

244
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,720
Y'all just got served on the gif topic, what else argument do you have for using that garbage?

245
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,760
Okay, everybody, now we can finally agree on at least two things, alright?

246
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,730
It's pronounced gif and you need to stop using them

247
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,200
I know it's sad, but all things must come to an end at some point and I think it's time that we finally retired

248
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
this outdated format

249
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,880
I know, how am I going to express my life if I can't express myself through Ariana Grande gifs?

250
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,410
I know it's going to be tough,

251
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,340
but you can get through this, I believe in you.

252
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,960
Just think about what Ariana said herself

253
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,760
&quot;I just had a bone taken out of my skull. how's ur day.&quot;

254
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,300
That's right. That's how I got out of my gif addiction.

255
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,480
So stop it, stop with this garbage

256
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,100
I don't want to see a single gif meme ever again in my entire life!

257
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Wait what's this? That's hilarious!

258
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,640
HYEEEH

259
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,560
*gasp*

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,480
