1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,700
A dress causes controversy!

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,060
Kanye West said WHAT?!

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,540
And my man, LP stops vlogging.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,020
I'm Gloriyah Burger and this is PEW NEWS!

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,660
poopooopoopoo

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,020
poopoopoopoopoopoopoopoopoopoopoopoopoo

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,520
StOp!!

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,260
Brad or Brad 2, what the heck are you doing?? You're supposed to edit the lasers so they come from my fingers.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,400
Instead you just blast them like all across the screen! What am I even paying you for?

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,560
(pause)

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,480
B2: Hello!

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,100
B1: Brad 2, it's Brad 1.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,800
This boy thinks we've got time to actually

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,780
track the lasers coming out of each of his individual fingers (laughing)

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,860
(Laugh continues)

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,660
Like we ain't-

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,500
B2: He's mental!

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,480
B1: Like we ain't got better sh*t to do with our day!

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,580
(more laughing)

20
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,920
B2: I know, right? Like he's not paying us enough, man. What the hell?

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,500
B1: He don't pay us ANYTHING! On top of that,

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,280
we've got an hour to edit each of these every day.

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,600
B2: But he's literally making us into slaves like this- this is ridiculous. Man this is ridiculous.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:06,100
*cue dope intro music*

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,530
Good evening, I'm Gloriyah Burger

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,210
Your favorite new-

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,700
The most reputable news source in this entire world. Our first story comes from Twitter-

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,900
and my god is everyone tweeting this at me.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,040
So apparently some guy got really mad and upset that some girl who is not Chinese

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,020
wore a Chinese dress to prom and she's not allowed to do that because that's cultural appropriation

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,940
and a ChInGa ChInGa ChInG cHoN- I'm not gonna do a racist Chinese accent for this.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,060
That would just be horrible and racist

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm not like Jeremy just dropping &quot;n&quot; bombs and other racist-

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,100
derogatory terms left and right while calling other people out.

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:56,810
Wait a minute

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,860
disgusting

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,880
hurtful language.

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,080
getting in-culturally appropriated right now.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,260
someone is wearing something that they are not allowed to wear.

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,130
And that's just- that's just mean and hurtful.

41
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,690
I'm glad we have people like Jeremy Lam-

42
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,330
Literal Saints (100%)

43
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,709
calling these people out.

44
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,290
after being called out for

45
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,310
(laughs) for all this.

46
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,570
Yes, I used to be more ignorant than I am now

47
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,200
My youth was not perfect. It was problematic

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,940
What?

49
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,640
Can we all just have a round of applause for Jeremy? I think he's got enough of it.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,750
He had a

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,260
non-perfect youth everybody.
All right so to summarize, in case I didn't explain it well enough-

52
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,330
this guy just found this girl on Twitter, and she was wearing a Chinese dress and he

53
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,560
made this tweet and it got a lot of retweets.

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,070
to take it upon himself to speak for all Chinese people, or all Chinese women for that matter-

55
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:17,110
It's not like he's worn the dress

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,700
Just be honest and say what it is, you wanted retweets online.

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,560
You wanted attention and you knew exactly how to get it.

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm sick of it. I don't even want to waste any more time on it. Let's move on!

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,170
poPOpopoPOPoPpoPo

60
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:42,880
(pause)

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,190
(Pewds continues) Sorry. I forgot to tell you, if you guys want to stop cultural appropriation-

62
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,540
Just buy the hat. This Cyka hat merch

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,020
it's got five days left on it before- before we never sell it again and

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,120
we don't ship to Russia (rip slavs) so that means anyone, but Russians can wear it.

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,970
And today in awesome news guys

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,000
Orange shirt kid finally was made into a dancing Fortnite. Remember orange shirt kid?

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,590
*beautiful music thanku brads*

68
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,669
He didn't win the Fortnite boogie-down challenge, so he would be made into a dancing Fortnite, and everyone got really mad.

69
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:24,000
*beautiful music again*

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,200
And he should've- CLEARLY should've won! This is the best dance I have ever seen in my life.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,720
Well

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,650
I got good news for you

73
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:37,620
It's made into a dance. How great! I'm sure he's going to get part of the revenue of course. Now this is all thanks to-

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,820
fabricated social media outrage.

75
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,520
(swede laughs)

76
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:50,420
That's started by Dolan Dark

77
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:56,400
Starting the hashtag #JusticeforOrangeShirtKid campaign. For real I think it's cool that Epic Games finally listened.

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
uhuuhuuhuh

79
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,040
He deserved to win. It's sort of not funny anymore. I feel like now, it's

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,380
the meme is dead, and I truly understand how people feel when I review a meme.

81
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,520
I mean when PewDiePie reviews a meme on meme review. I get it now!

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,220
Next News!

83
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,040
PEw PewPew

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,180
Today in awesome news A.S.S. is coming out of every single console ever, in May!!

85
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,100
pOoo POoo poo POo pOo p00 pew

86
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,960
And today an awesome news, Logan Paul stopped daily vlogging (finally!)

87
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,820
Wait a minute

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,890
Are you telling me someone that is making less ad revenue than ever and probably selling less merch than ever

89
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,629
decided to go on another path of earning revenue. I don't understand this

90
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,380
I don't understand it at all.

91
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,680
(Help the broke child)
Please buy a hat in case you haven't already.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:55,780
Honestly legit- I I am making more on selling these hats this month than I'm making on ad revenue despite uploading daily content.

93
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,700
Do you understand how bad ad revenue is? I might as well not even call myself a youtuber. I'm a hat merch-

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,520
I'm a hat salesman at this point. That is my profession.

95
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,900
And really just- I want to thank YouTube for having such great way of monetizing on their platform.

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,620
It's it's wonderful. I'm so thankful.
 (Flawless work YT)

97
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,310
*more pews*

98
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,380
You probably notice Kanye West has been tweeting a looot.

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:24,420
Lately among things, what he tweeted was &quot;I love the way Candace Owens thinks&quot;.

100
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:31,740
This got a lot of news coverage and it became sort of a controversial statement, let's see why-

101
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,370
why that is. &quot;Victim mentality is not cool. I don't know why people like being oppressed its the weirdest thing I've ever heard

102
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,640
'I love oppression! We're oppressed! 400 years of slavery! Jim Crow!'

103
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,940
Which by the way none of you guys lived through. Your grandparents didn't.

104
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,540
It's embarrassing that you utilize- you utilize their history. You're not living through anything right now.

105
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,780
You're overly privileged Americans!&quot; then following up with &quot;self victimization is a disease&quot;

106
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,640
&quot;We have freedom of speech, but not freedom of thought&quot; now

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,970
I talked about ego a few videos back, and I realize now

108
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,760
I I was wrong. Kanye has such a massive ego

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,760
And he was so aware of it that he doesn't back down of what other people are criticizing him for which is so

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,510
rare these days, the fact that everyone just backs down is what has created this polarizing

111
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,570
Climate of ideas where we all know in a public setting. What ideas are

112
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,380
Allowed to be said and what ideas are just plainly not and a lot of times common

113
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,290
Sense is forbidden because it doesn't fall in the pool of thoughts that

114
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:43,520
We're allowed to say or allowed to think because they're somewhat controversial and they they get attached to all these

115
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,690
Extremist groups when really a lot of times

116
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,760
We're just talking common sense obviously

117
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,100
Kanye thinks like this because he's a very

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,780
successful guy

119
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,810
If anything it's nice to see people staying true to their ideas because for too long everyone is bought into the same sort of mentality

120
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,270
I've done that mistake myself for example here with the case of the dress

121
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:12,620
I'm glad that keziah decided not to delete the the tweet and be proud of her dress just because this sparked public outrage

122
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,950
Doesn't mean that she thought she was wrong and she- in my opinion, she wasn't next POOOOO

123
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,039
what the fu-

124
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,959
&quot;Nice to see you Danny

125
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,529
I'm going to take a nap&quot; let's talk about Avicii

126
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,959
you guys probably heard of was it a few weeks ago Avicii he died and

127
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,779
It sort of came as a surprise if you've seen photos of him near the the death

128
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,379
You could tell something was wrong Avicii died of apparent suicide

129
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:47,709
He really struggled with thoughts about meaning life happiness, and he could not go on any longer

130
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:53,230
He wanted to find peace this whole story sort of

131
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,500
Hit a bit too close home for me with

132
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,949
Young Swedish guy. I think he was he was my age even

133
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:06,730
From Sweden he described himself as an introvert. He just had a passion and it became successful obviously

134
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,230
I'm nowhere near successful as Avicii, but it's

135
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,490
I

136
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,120
It's it's too similar to me. I feel like you know in another universe this could have been me

137
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,790
I obviously don't know Tim. I never met him

138
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:28,029
it's not really fair on me to project a bunch of ideas around it in 2016 Tim Bergling had stopped touring because

139
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:32,189
He had some health issues, but he also said &quot;to me, It was something

140
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,920
I had to do for my health the scene was not for me

141
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,680
It was not the shows and not the music it was always the other

142
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,199
Stuff surrounding it that never came natural to me all the other parts of being an artist

143
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:47,220
I'm more of an introverted person in general. It was always very hard for me

144
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:55,660
I took on board too much negative energy. I think&quot; I can imagine Tim. Just wanting to create music. He's a passionate guy that

145
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,079
Became successful everything that came with it was just too much. I don't know

146
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:04,500
I'm just speculating I know it's not really fair of me to do

147
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,809
But I want to be able to discuss this at least or what I think about it because a lot of people look at people

148
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,800
That are successful, and they just think how could they commit suicide

149
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,189
They have everything and I'm not saying that so that I would get some sort of pity or like oh, it's so hard

150
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:28,269
It's really that's not it at all. I'm just saying it for you guys, so you understand that this whole idea of

151
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,350
fetishizing

152
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,160
Success in a way that it's the ultimate goal

153
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,980
that if you get popular then you've acquired everything and if you've acquired money

154
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,259
then that's all that matters because it really isn't and

155
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,379
We really need to stop thinking that way. I've talked about happiness a lot on this channel. It's a topic

156
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,709
I discussed a lot because I've seen so many people struggle with it you youtubers

157
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:57,100
I mean because I think constantly being evaluated by numbers as soon as you make one mistake it will seem like the whole

158
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,620
Your whole fan base and everyone has just turned against you. With a tragedy like this

159
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,600
I feel like I want to do something about it. I feel like I can do something, but I don't know what

160
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,779
When I filmed scare PewDiePie I think that was the worst time for me when I did YouTube because I felt so trapped

161
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:19,139
Doing something that I didn't really want to do I was taken away from what I really wanted to do was  to make videos

162
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,230
but

163
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,810
My network at the time had just put up so many projects and so many things on me

164
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,720
I was stuck doing things that I didn't want to do even though

165
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:37,060
I had the dream laid out for me and as an introvert a lot of times things that seem, seem attractive and

166
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,100
Amazing things is just a chore and and a pain and it's not for everyone. I realize in a way now

167
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,689
I'm talking about Tim's suicide in a way that for me to talk about my own problems

168
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,329
But I do think they correlate in a sense. I did like I said, I don't know Tim

169
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,779
I don't know what he went through, but what from what I can gather at least

170
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:04,509
I feel like I can at least understand it to some degree we're so stuck on this idea that successful people have everything

171
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,170
It makes it even harder to open up about these issues

172
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,689
I'm just really really sorry and my thoughts go out to Tim's family and

173
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:18,970
His friends and his fans that was it for pew news everybody way to end it on a high note

174
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,699
