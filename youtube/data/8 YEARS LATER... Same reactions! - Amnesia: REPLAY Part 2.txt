1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,500
you feel that you feel that atmosphere

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,750
damn welcome back everybody to Misha

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,519
part 2 I remember this place I wish I

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,799
didn't I don't know what to trust

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,840
writer books all right let's great are

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,160
we gonna start off this episode by

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,019
repeating May 1839 we start off with a

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,519
loading screen the other shilling share

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,250
him be on pinching African Sun has

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,579
continued to plague our expedition

11
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,640
making it impossible to dig until dusk

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,320
how professor Herbert managed to find

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,540
the location in these vast plains of

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,100
nothing there all from pressing our

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,129
mystery to me when I asked him about the

16
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,410
tomb again he told me about the legend

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,940
of tin Hunnam the mother of us all an

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,190
interesting story in its own right but I

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,640
can't help feeling there's more later

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
that evening

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
we uncovered a passage beneath the dunes

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,980
leading to a sand covered stones

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,860
structure the professor was confident it

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
was the tomb we sought and ordered the

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,180
others to clear the way late into the

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,450
dark cold night damn tomorrow I shall

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,700
lead the men into the ancient structure

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,759
hoping to reach the burial chamber no

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,530
matter what the professor is keeping

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,509
from me the dig should yield something

31
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,490
interesting to take back to London and

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,710
the British Museum

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,070
I don't remember any of this story this

34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,960
is great tradition they can be

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,780
impossible to dig I'll professor Herbert

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,310
managed to find the location in these

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,900
vaults the paintings have nothing

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,940
amazing so we're playing on hard mode in

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,090
case you didn't know good all hard mode

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,460
it's brand new for amnesia in case you

41
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,380
were for some reason wondering why we're

42
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,570
playing amnesia again so it's it's

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,970
harder when you can't save the game as

44
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,820
often insanity will kill you you're a

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,040
total freakin bad axe if you play this

46

60
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,150

64
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:56,580

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,000
not opened

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,960
[Music]

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,050
see I don't feel safe reading like this

68
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,580
I'll read like this 17th of May 1839 my

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,700
hands tremble as I write I feel a need

70
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,190
to document my tribulation for I fear

71
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,240
that my memory will fail me if I linger

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,430
today I took some men and ventured into

73
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,420
the dark ancient passage we uncovered a

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,340
torches burned faintly in the murky air

75
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,970
as we slowly made our way underground

76
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,390
the men were superstitious and fearful

77
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,460
they argued loudly and I felt their

78
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,060
strange language getting to me I

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,680
mustered my strength and yelled at them

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
to continue down the slips and broken

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,850
steps on an the crudely carved passage

82
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,850
confused me it looked much older than

83
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,560
the fourth century structure we had

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,130
expected the twisting path emerged into

85
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,670
a great antechamber the walls were lined

86
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,350
with statues unlike any I'd ever seen

87
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,750
despite their unearthly quality I felt a

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,900
strange familiarity toward them which

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,410
haunts me still at the far end of the

90
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,290
chamber a great slab of stone sealed off

91
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,410
would ever lay ahead I gave the order to

92
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,419
raise it and as I pushed through the

93
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,880
narrow space the heavy stone suddenly

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,160
dropped ceiling me inside I was trapped

95
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,670
when you had a bad day you take come on

96
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,450
down

97
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,650
I maybe they can make amnesia - in

98
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,730
Algeria you know what I mean what god

99
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,820

we I think we have to go where the with

131
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,070
that gentleman was making his wonderful

132
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:59,100
little noise you know I recorded I'm

133
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,980
Nisha I was still in university and I

134
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,500
hated it and my sleep schedule was just

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,190
completely off I would legit record this

136
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,800
game I would wake up randomly and like

137
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,260
3:00 a.m. and I would sit down and I

138
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,870
would record myself playing this and it

139
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,690
was like entering another round it was

140
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,690
like the most immersive experience I

141
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:32,120
both hated and loved it

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:40,730
trying to be conservative or yeah that's

143
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:51,669
bad that's real bad Oh what OH

144
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,580
all right we're fine no did I just die I

145
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,710
think I just died I think it's a sign no

146
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,819
I didn't die 39 after pounding the

147
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,039
unforgiving stone wall for what seemed

148
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,279
like an eternity and realized it was

149
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,669
hopeless I was trapped I fell to the

150
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,439
ground

151
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,139
gasping for air trying to focus that's

152
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,270
when I saw a faint shimmer my weakened

153
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,999
body was heavy to carry but I managed to

154
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:26,550
push myself toward the enchanting light

155
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,029
it was waiting for me it closed in dark

156
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,000
nothingness I felt myself drawn to the

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,060
mystic lightning

158
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,200
it's so appealing I'm like I'm off I

159
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,210
want it it's like a tight pod reached

160
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,960
out a reed in my hands the faint glow

161
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,510
escaped my fingers began to spark

162
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,840
brightly and spirit me away I'm looking

163
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,290
a lien memories of spiraling towers

164
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,150
endless deserts and impossible geometry

165
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,950
the next thing I cannot believe that one

166
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,040
is the grating sound of stone being

167
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,340
lifted the voices of the Arab pulling me

168
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,090
to safety grasped firmly in my hands was

169
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:25,090
the broken pieces I think most so that's

170
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,160
probably what curse name I don't

171
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,910
remember kingdom of Persia we're missing

172
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,070
something here how's our sanity head is

173
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,860
pounding hands are shaking not good not

174
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,060
good Felix okay and how do we make the

175
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,900
sanity go up again hasn't been attempted

176
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,840
to for centuries when the shadow arrives

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,310
it won't take long and two things start

178
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,510
falling apart

179
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,300
we're just buying time anyway let's do

180
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,050
what we can

181
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,960
there isn't much to be done and Wars we

182
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,690
should reinforce weak structures the

183
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,400
ground will tremble and there's a risk

184
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,520
everything will cave in on us especially

185
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,900
downstairs here here and there let's get

186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,330
the servants working on it

187
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,660
well they weren't lying about hardmode

188
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,040
we're not doing too well

189
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,840
so I remember that was a puzzle here

190
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,510
that was kind of tricky or was it I

191
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,140
think literally I just throw this at it

192
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,330
[Applause]

193
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,190

196
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,020
my hand that's pretty pretty weird you

197
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,220
have to be Swift

198
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,730
when you activate the first one you hear

199
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,460
that if it stops you'll have to start

200
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,290
over

201
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,590
is it all this a bit excessive you can

202
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,510
never be too careful with that I

203
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,680
remember this one

204
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,070
oh god this is our first interaction

205
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,540
with the son of a snake Oh God okay

206
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,160

207
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,040

it's a note here ha Alstead of random ur

209
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,220
castle 1801 another region rich with

210
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,500
lore is outside deep within the east

211
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,540
persian woods for centuries there have

212
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,250
been stories surrounding the hamlet and

213
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,139
his neighbor Castle Brennan

214
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,420
that's so that's where we are the quiet

215
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,610
for Virginia's I know the quiet forest

216
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,519
glad mom's dress with scabbard Lake is a

217
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,550
picturesque as it can be obey it

218
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,800
the area is haunted by the dark and ask

219
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,959
any local and you will hear proof of the

220
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,940
widespread superstition all travelers

221
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,370
should indulge in themselves in such

222
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,220
conversation since it will certainly

223
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,279
serve as exciting entertainment all of

224
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,870
them have their own twist on the tales

225
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,300
but there are some motives that keep

226
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,660
reappearing the gatherers that's the

227
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,529
monster there the gatherer is that it I

228
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,550
don't know I don't remember this story

229
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,110
reached all the way back to the time of

230
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,250
the 30 years more it is said that

231
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,050
soldiers who abandoned their duty got

232
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,120
lost in the cold dog woods and we're

233
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,819
forever damned to roam the grounds their

234
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,639
bodies brought by they're tainted Souls

235
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,370
have left him disfigured and empty of

236
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,910
essence many have sight sighted them

237
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,139
over the years and described them as

238
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,569
horrid revenants they move silently

239
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,089
through the woods shying away from any

240
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,790
beholder they are called gatherers as

241
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,250
they seem to follow some ambition to

242
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,490
steal living creatures it is their prey

243
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,040
which can be heard struggling inside the

244
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,889
dam inside dam for a lab sacks dragged

245
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:16,880
behind them which reveal their presence

246
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,810
what dark scheme do they follow

247
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:31,000
oh so this is lure a visit sundown

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,279
Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa Agrippa that

249
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,550
we meet him later the well-known Airy

250
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,590
erudite visited all stat at the start of

251
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,589
the sixteenth century he reside in the

252
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:43,779
local inn for a fortnight as he looked

253
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,540
for remnants of kingdoms past during his

254
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,520
stay all the prominent members of

255
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,710
society paid notice and he is mentioned

256
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,200
in many records of the time one day he

257
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,820
went to investigate a borough in the

258
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,220
northwestern glades only to never be

259
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,500
seen again Heinrich is known to have

260
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,770
passed away in Brenham Grenoble's some

261
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,290
10 years later he dismissed the notion

262
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,020
of ever visiting all a site which makes

263
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,210
you wonder what really happened who was

264
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,040
this mysterious man who visited the

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,320
sleepy hamlet in the woods and what

266
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,310
happened to him and then finally the

267
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,890
important baked Baron sorry the Baron of

268
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,830
Brandenburg lives a reclusive life with

269
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,200
his family at his castle nearby all

270
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,620
stank and like most those of noble birth

271
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,870
rumors are inherited alongside with the

272
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,390
title researching the history reveals a

273
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,700
little before the castle was consumed by

274
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,430
fire in the late 16th century it was

275
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,980
rebuilt by Alexander a nobleman from the

276
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,410
Rhinelands claiming the role as

277
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,140
protector of the Persian State Alexander

278
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,600
helped the region to flourish and remain

279
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,020
popular throughout his presumed lifetime

280
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,780
the family but he's aligned the family

281
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,250
has always been secretly when it comes

282
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,320
to an image and heritage

283
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,910
therefore the birth and death of

284
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,070
Alexander and his offspring has never

285
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,310
been fully recorded this has fed the

286
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,260
idea that the Baron is in fact the one

287
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,370
and the same who came from the west over

288
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,770
300 years ago lived through the time of

289
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,830
occupation and joined the coveted order

290
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,980

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,960
years ago I was summoned to the castle

happened about what this supposed knight

of the order who could want from me and

accept the imitation the Baron was

437

friendly and offered me a proposition it

438
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,180
dawned on me that the nature of the

439
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,520
contract was sordid and the reason and

440
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,320
that the reason I was chosen was because

441
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,810
of the follies of my past and not the

442

honors I had been rewarded with during

443

healthy humans upon his slightest whim

445
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,930
