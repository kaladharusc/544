14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,000
did I miss this see i missed this skyline I missed my skateboard i missed

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
the smell

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,240
there's no late night movie there's no priests like there's no place like home

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:27,520
and this my juice remember my just thank you love this juice

18
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,430
I've been missed my commute to work every day i love this commute

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:48,100
I actually miss this studio you know making videos and running this operation

20
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,850
and everything i do all of that infrastructure is built around this

21
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,930
physical space and being away from it makes it all really hard working from an

22
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,510
airplane seat is not as glamorous as it may seem just tearing through some of

23
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,220
the packages i got while I was away

24
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,550
got some great stuff like Matthew Santoro his new book

25
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,690
Thank You Matthew site to dive into this thing and that I got some curious things

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,420
one in particular

27
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,060
rogaine hair regrowth treatment hair loss is real and it's something that

28
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,920
affects a lot of people around the world now me so far in life i have not been

29
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,700
affected

30
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,890
look at the strength of this hairline I'm 35 years old there isn't even any

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,430
signs of even the most nothing

32
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,930
look at this look at the thickness of this hip I got a lot of problems in life

33
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,930
but hair loss is not one of them

34
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,070
I need my grandfather died with a full head I could be one of those circus

35
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,070
freaks that dances from there

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:01,300
it's so thick you could knit a sweater with my hair so thanks for the gesture I

37
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,330
don't I I don't know what to do with this

38
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,140
if you'd like a three month supply of rogaine just let me know in the comments

39
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,790
below and i will have dylan email you send it to you or something

40
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,920
now without a doubt the hardest part of me having been away for the last couple

41
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,970
weeks was being away from my family but in a very very close second place for

42
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,810
the hardest thing about being away from last week's was knowing that these two

43
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:40,060
guys right year we're sitting in the office now few months ago you might

44
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,840
remember i had a very early boosted board version to prototype here in the

45
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,450
studio that was not that was not a working like fully functional prototype

46
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,590
that was just me me like harassing boosted being like send me anything i

47
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,860
just want to check it out and they were super cool and they sent me that is

48
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,460
crazy bright and they sent me that one with a disclaimer that like Casey this

49
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,260
is not a finished product

50
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,570
ok this this is a finished product up

51
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,789
I have been waiting so long for this and I was especially heartbroken after

52
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:24,900
losing my boosted boards in Colorado that look better hotel or exposed and

53
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:32,550
man oh man I love to have one of these bastards while while i was in South

54
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:46,529
America 40 boosted me likey are boosted board version 2 as abusive work better

55
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,250
and there's one thing I know and that is that the only thing better than a

56
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:58,620
brand-new version to boosted board is two brand-new version to boosted boards

57
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,199
don't really need two of these things probably not to get overexcited and get

58
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,789
two of these

59
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,169
yeah any regrets none what so

60
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,340
i boosted what is what is that was was loaded mean

61
00:06:43,240 --> 00:07:00,430
alright boosted five ready to be christened very very minor change of

62
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,470
plans actually take the unmarked boosted six here instead of boosted five because

63
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,120
the paint doesn't seem to want to dry and I like got all of my clothes in my

64
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,990
hands

65
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm just gonna take the new new one that having pornero on yet i always say that

66
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,610
i'm going to do a comprehensive review of things and then I never do but this

67
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,720
is going to be different

68
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
besides my camera I don't know of a gadget i have in my life that I take

69
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,560
more damage up in my electric skateboard

70
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:53,070
alright it's faster it grips the road better it's like it's like sticks to the

71
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,000
ground and I know they said something about improved trucks and improve wheels

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,200
but like you can really feel the difference it's like it like quarters

73
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,160
like a lambo all right the rest the review is going to be to be continued

74
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:14,400
remember book hi remember before when I said that my family was my number one in

75
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,230
the spoofs it borders number two

76
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,460
i promised candace i'd be home by six so we can do something tonight it's 603 so

77
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,140
i just got home and nobody's here but check this out

78
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,580
remember when Francine did that modeling for Juicy Couture it's her modeling

79
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:38,520
photo all gigantic and frame like really you're good man for sending this over to

80
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,360
find girls that they were in the pharmacy

81
00:08:44,540 --> 00:09:14,920
yeah

82
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:23,889
she made it to find a friend seen this is uncharted territory for you

83
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,990
that in mind that ladder give her some space and

84
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
baby sleep

85
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,380
Candace's asleep you know all this awesome traveling and only exploring

86
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,490
everything I get to do

87
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,100
it's amazing and I'm thankful and I'm happy everyday at the opportunity to do

88
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,089
these things but at the end of all of it i don't think there's anything that

89
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:07,339
makes me happier and feel more fulfilled than being home with the family

90
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,889
sorry guys I don't mess up your wedding maybe sneak through their

91
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,329
congratulations
