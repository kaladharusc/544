1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,890

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,080

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:15,859
trailer is out do a trailer reaction to

4
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:20,550
sit down sit down we're going to react

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,670
to this trailer whether you want to or

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,210
not

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,439
Ralph it's better okay yes I agree but

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,340
transformer six otherwise known as

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,350
bumblebee okay we'll see what you think

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,030
after the trailer I haven't seen the

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,010
trailer maybe it will convince us

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,290
otherwise but as you can tell I think

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,750
we're all sick and tired of sort of the

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,579
overproduced michael bay looking

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,250
transformers we shall see okay this time

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,530
it's directed by Travis Knight as a

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,050
budget of 102 million dollars comes out

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,180
at the end of this year let's check it

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:02,820
out right now three two one go another

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,770
countdown okay

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:13,979
why it's green flare why toys just toys

22
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,420
that's what transformers was made

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,240
because it actually came from Japanese

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,250
toys that were then relabeled

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:28,409
transformers and get it there's bees you

26
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:40,000
get it

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,160
it's uh I guess that's the new Shia

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,080
LeBouf what part of all was that that

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:56,560
was his dong I know that was his dong er

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,460
PI looks familiar

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,710
she's got that Chloe more tears kind of

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,960
look she's not freaked out that just

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,310
looks like a younger phone

34
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,830
yes he's not screaming I'd be like what

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,030
why is he scared of her

36
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,230
do you speak we're gonna do this whole

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:47,080
thing over

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,240
John Cena 5000 that's the fucking

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,720
bad-ass transformer though that

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,950
Starscream

41
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,700
this is why you're here be

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,510
music can help you say what you're

43
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:18,190
feeling that's cheap I like that song

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,290
always I'm an Internet kid so of course

45
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,780
I'm gonna like that song all right guys

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,760
what did you think I'd rather watch B

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,880
movie - yeah B - I don't know if that's

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,540
a real thing

49
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,870
but guys uh yeah it just seems kind of

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,730
pointless to keep the Transformers train

51
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,070
rolling I think that they probably don't

52
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,200
expect this film to do quite as well and

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,670
give it a hundred eight million dollars

54
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,350
that's almost as much money as they gave

55
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,450
Black Panther oh yeah it's so much

56
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,860
that's a lot of money you know so I

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,780
guess this is gonna be a prequel to

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,680
where bumblebee meets Shiloh's Schuyler

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,630
character yeah because he's in this old

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,150
beetle form I mean he's a he turned it

61
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,570
to a Camaro she dies yeah so where is

62
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,230
she in this whole franchise it's not

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,900
that I give a shit about the plot holder

64
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,030
was yeah so there's really not much

65
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,310
other than his dong that just kind of

66
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,310
fucking I went straight to the dong

67
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,740
she's giving it a big old look there and

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,230
shining it down and then she notices

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,169
that he so the only good thing about the

70
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,910
trailer is that with this design of

71
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,400
bumblebee I can see what's happening you

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,169
know what I mean like a lot of the other

73
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:43,480
ones have just so many shards and and

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,780
and crooks and crannies that it's just

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,630
difficult to look at I don't really like

76
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,540
his I don't know about you but I was

77
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,110
never a big bumblebee guy no I just give

78
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,990
me a jazz moving I'd rather

79
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,240
Optimus Prime sure but not even Optimus

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,010
Prime for me it was all the freakin

81
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,250
Decepticons that I was big fans of you

82
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,050
know Starscream Megatron beast wars is

83
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,210
when I really came on and I watched the

84
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,430
shit out of that crappy CGI but for our

85
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,070
time it was pretty good it revitalized

86
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,940
the transfer

87
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,580
warmers for us but yeah this is a film

88
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,150
that it's basically the Han Solo of the

89
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,430
Transformers Universe you don't really

90
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,940
need to see bumblebees history has

91
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,990
prequel we don't and they're talking

92
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,580
about the trailer news now I know I

93
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,650
don't have to see it I mean I was

94
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,910
already pretty sure I wasn't gonna see

95
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,770
this movie right now I know I don't

96
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:58,480

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,140
okay what do you think of this girl I

100
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,390
don't care generic generic don't care

101
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,560
yep

102
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,230
got it not excited that there's a female

103
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,180
lead we kind of got baited and switched

104
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,220
in the last transformers where we had a

105
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,320
lot of girl power and I'm independent

106
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:32,530
and yes and it really wasn't like that

107
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,240
in the main movie but now we are getting

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,580
a female lead in here is that gonna sell

109
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,300
tickets

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,770
I don't know here's what's gonna sell

111
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,970
tickets I bet you John Cena is where's

112
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,870
John Cena um I don't know there is

113
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,580
there's John Cena you think he can take

114
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,320
it you know I bet you what's really

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,140
gonna sell tickets not not bumblebee not

116
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,669
John Cena not a female lead but

117
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,190
Starscream if that's him I don't know

118
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,840
because there have there have been

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
several jet characters that's gonna be

120
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,750
the last 10 minutes though no he's got

121
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,470
to have a villain to fight and I just

122
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,270
don't know where if they keep it to a

123
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,870
more personal story if they don't shove

124
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,200
a ton of Transformers and a ton of

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,430
supporting characters into this film and

126
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,350
keep it about bumblebee and his

127
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,990
relationship with that girl and put that

128
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,840
girl in danger from this dis Decepticon

129
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,030
I don't know why he would want to grab

130
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,050
the girl or

131
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,440
attacker but if it's like that then then

132
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,220
maybe you have yourself a touching story

133
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,139
or more isolated snow wants to see a

134
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,940
touching story in a Transformers movie

135
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,050
though you see these movies because you

136
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,909
want to see a CG fest of two robots

137
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,889
fighting each other absolutely correct I

138
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,740
mean I go to see transformers to see

139
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,039
fucking blue lasers and red lasers and

140
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,090
machine guns and action not a bonding

141
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,849
between this female character who we've

142
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,430
never seen before don't care about have

143
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,349
to go through her origin story have to

144
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,500
go with wire life suck so bad that she's

145
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,400
bonding with mama bleep if I didn't have

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,259
to do a review on it I wouldn't go into

147
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,210
it as you can tell we're very negative

148
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,360
about both bumblebee do you think it's

149
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,190

00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:34,149
which is a comedy Will Ferrell john c

166
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,370

167
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,100

168
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,680
with the enemy eyes and cgi lady with

169
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,209
nobody's gonna see that one that was

170
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,640
gonna bomb Mary Poppins I'm gonna laugh

171
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,970
so hard if bumblebee out

172
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,980
Aquaman I don't want that to be the case

173
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,710
I'm DC fanboy I want Aquaman to be good

174
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,860

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,460
that's our opinion on bumblebee we don't

177
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,230
want to see it we're forced to see it

178
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,510
we're coming in very negative but can

179
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,370
the film win our hearts

180
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:17,920
