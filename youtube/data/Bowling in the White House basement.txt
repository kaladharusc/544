1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:25,289
I have been sitting on this footage I've

2
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,689
been sitting on this movie for five

3
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,099
years since 2012 I've been waiting to

4
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,710
make this movie that entire time because

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,320
patiently waiting for the day to come

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,960
where I could tell the story of going

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:56,460
bowling in the White House I get a lot

8
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,590
of weird people emailing me weird things

9
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,680
all the time but in the summer 2012 some

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
total stranger emailed me and was like

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,700
hey I work in the White House would you

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,920
like to come down and go bowling and

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,740
have pizza and beer in the basement of

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,900
the White House to which I responded in

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,950
enthusiastic but I'll write in our final

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,110
station song you're just a ship

17
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,390
Washington

18
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,400
so yeah so we took the train to the

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,230
White House met a group of strangers

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,870
went into the White House and that's how

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,340
we're bowling we're in route to the

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,530
White House now not super excited about

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,110
the way my collar fits this corner is

24
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,310
where we're supposed to be meeting the

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,229
folks that are taking it to the White

26
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,270
House whom we've never met before

27
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,180
I don't know what they look like

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,660
our time in trouble was owing if he

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,950
didn't have his identification but he

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,490
school

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:06,830

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,940
who invited me who is in the Obama one

37
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,860
administration said to me at the end of

38
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,300
the day I filmed everything he was like

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,370

42
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,930
this on the internet so long as Barack

43
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,590
Obama is our president when Donald Trump

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,440
was sworn into office last week it meant

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,860
that I could finally release just kind

46
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,520
of not even back to the video but it's

47

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,040
basement and this is a bowling alley two

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,989
lanes here classical style feeding

55
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,680

all right here is where we have a piece

60
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,970
of situation and here is where we have

61
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,030
the all-american beer and then

62
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,400
and not to anyone in the Trump

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,840
administration if you'd like to invite

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,290
me or my kid back for some more force

65
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,210
more bowling just just get a call I got

66
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,460
to get that bowling at the White House

67
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:18,760
has been fun and now you go home our

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,960
nation's 17 trillion dollars in debt

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,040
upgrading the president's private

70
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,180
bowling alley shouldn't be a priority a

71
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,950
spiffy new bowling alley may suit the

72
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,080
wants for commander in chief but I think

73
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,850
I speak for the taxpayers of the 7th

74
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,740
congressional district when I assert

75
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,590
it's certainly not a need

76
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:49,000
