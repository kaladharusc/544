17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:38,290
it's raining out there

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,960
I just realized that my drone was strapped to my back pack and the cameras

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,430
wet

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,020
these things are top but i don't think they can handle being wet

21
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,649
yeah

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,420
yeah only work

23
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,510
in the last week of crash at the into active power lines were dropped 13

24
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,910
smashed on the ground and then got it soaking wet from the pouring rain

25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,970
consider me moving parts these things have their incredibly tough now I tried

26
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,200
my hardest always to be as honest with you

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,630
audience as I possibly can but there has been something I've been keeping out of

28
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,530
like the episodes here for quite some time that I need to address

29
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,610
check out the skateboard this is a custom

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,560
beam penny board actually made us these in Australia and send them to us they

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,650
sent us like 10 of these for those of you who don't know

32
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,280
beam it's a nap it's like a social network

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,269
it's a company that i started with my friend Matt a year ago it used to be

34
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,099
like the only thing I talked about on the vlog was being it was all about my

35
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,420
company but in the last like six months I haven't mentioned it not once have

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,450
been getting a lot of flack for it in the comments below like what's going on

37
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,700
is it out of business are you still running your company

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,349
why don't you talk about it so today i want to explain what's going on exactly

39
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,669
what you're not so like a year and a half ago or something like that

40
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,359
I started this company called beam with this idea that like could we build an

41
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,400
app could we build a way we share video we are excited to make any video

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,049
so how to make videos on beams I just go and now it's recording video and then I

43
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,150
go and now that video has been shared everyone who follows me and that's it

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,329
and it's like this awesome little platform we built this thing we launched

45
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,139
it last July they caught in the launch was like totally not

46
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,150
that's my studio and that's being beam headquarters is awesome we've got a

47
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,720
couch

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,770
this projector situation which we used mostly for work but sometimes sometimes

49
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,760
for video games

50
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,020
we got Alex and Steve working on a Sunday upon that we got snacks

51
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,090
lots and lots and lots of snacks in fact all the snacks that show up from mail

52
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,690
time

53
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,360
whether it's unhealthy for super healthy all that ends up here and the beam squad

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,520
has a magical way of making it disappear then after that crazy launch when we

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,730
raise more money and then we hired a whole bunch of people we have this new

56
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,720
office

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,140
we just started like building building building and then like people sort of

58
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,100
stopped downloading being and a lot of people stop using being and started to

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,680
fade away and were like what's going on here

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,940
and Matt my business partner i realized that like this up kind of sucks like the

61
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,920
idea is awesome but the app itself is not it needs to be better

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,790
so in January we sat down like the entire team all of being squad and we're

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,330
like how do we make this thing better and we think we figured out we think

64
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,290
with your how to make it the awesome app it needed to be that way to build it and

65
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,880
that took us the last like five months four and a half months to make it

66
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,480
the thing that should have been we launched to make it great

67
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,530
and I read all the comments i read everybody asking with your beam is it

68
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,450
over there are you still doing it

69
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,370
why don't you talk about it every time I mention the name beam people download it

70
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,050
and then we didn't want downloads it wasn't ready so i had to stop talking

71
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,590
about it was so painful for me to not talk about it

72
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,870
so today finally we launch the app on the App Store and on the google play

73
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,270
store go download it check it out

74
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,910
it sucks just delete it if you like it with oh but more importantly I will be

75
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:46,680
once again talking about my job which is being on this channel and hopefully

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,210
people can stop asking why are you talking about being because i will now

77
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,890
be talking about being also i launched the second video today it just explains

78
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,810
what beam is

79
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,810

80
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:12,650

82
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:21,919

83
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,630
I'm going to your tomorrow this is probably a terrible idea but I feel like

84
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,210
the city is so empty and it's so dark out

85
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,840
it's the perfect opportunity to meet please try

86
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,580
any what could possibly go wrong

87
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,130
ok little weird i did not tell it to fly over there it just took off and took off

88
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,560
all right I didn't wreck the drone but definitely applies funny with these

89
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,920
lights on it or I'll just doing something wrong kind of amazing it looks

90
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,660
like a spaceship is fly to get inside before you're in trouble

91
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:51,389
sounds like somebody's having fun and it wasn't invited

92
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,340
it's casey
