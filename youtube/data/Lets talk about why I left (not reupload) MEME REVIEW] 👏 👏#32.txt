Huh, look at this. Look at this cute lil' meme.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,320
I bet he was thinking, &quot;Why..? I'm still alive?!

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,700
Why has he not reviewed me yet?

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,800
Maybe I get to live!

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,020
It's a miracle!

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,700

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,900

Humans: Creates other reli-ligerzins (Pewd speak for religions)

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,800
God: Excuse me?

17

Look at the solar system every single other planet has been proven round. So what cluster of event led to the earth being flat?

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,030
Riddle me that

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,540
The earth is not a planet.

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,100
Excuse me. WTF

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,619

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,340
Congratulations when you are in a crowded area, and you need to get somewhere

86
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,580
It's nice to finally have a meme

87
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,470
that just cares about

88
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:52,180
Positivity this meme gets a five extra plus for positivity and a positive movement. I love positivity

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,630
It just makes me so positive. Damn. There's a monster under my beard. Yeah

90
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:05,159
Well, yes, technically there is a monster under your bed, but there's no reason to be afraid of it. Have you read the ingredients?

91
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,270
What Nani Nani?

92
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,880
Deskah Nani the F. What is this?

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,820
This is not epic  Dad there's a loser under my beard

94
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,949
Okay, this is epic

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,500
Nothing, bro. That's my world without you, bro

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,740

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:39,060
All right, okay, all right

99
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,240
*lip smack*

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,940
Meme review

101
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,820
*clap x2*

102
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,950
What happened am I even reviewing memes anymore I guess I don't bro

103
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,150
Yes, bro. Close your eyes bro. Okay, bro

104
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,960
You're a good boy, bro. I know bro

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,980
Goodbye, bro. This is so sad

106
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,040
Alexa can you play pewdiepie playing despacito? Alexa: I can't your video got copystrike

107
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,780
That's right everybody!

108
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,780
Apparently my cover was so good that it got claimed by 21 parties, I guess

109
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,030
It was just too close to the original

110
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,960
Thank you. Really appreciate that

111
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,940
I'll fight this and I'll fight it. I'll take it to court god damn it. Close your eyes bro. Okay, bro

112
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,640
Watcha see bro?

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,360
Nuthin bro

114
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,640
*whisper* That's my world without you bro

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
Bro

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,910
THIS IS SO SAD

117
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:41,710
ALEXA can we cast obsidian? While playing Despacito? not the regular one, the Pewdiepie one

118
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,880
without the copy strike condition

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Thank you

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,020
Thank you

121
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,900
You don't look so good, bro

122
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,700
I'm fine bro

123
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,100
Okay, let's go tell the world we're free bro

124
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,900
*whispers* We're free bro

125
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,380
Why did you just whisper that to me bro?

126
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,120
Because you are

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,420
My world bro

128
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,020
Broooo

129
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,040
Mmm

130
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,930
All right all memes aside

131
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:13,630
Well, maybe not and you guys probably heard Stefan Karl Stefansson uh passed away after a 3 year long battle with Cancer

132
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:20,280
Normally when someone passes away it's frowned upon to make jokes about it. All right, you can't just can't do it

133
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,810
but with Stefan being so active on Reddit and involved in the meme community and really

134
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,510
Embracing with open arms the how popular that we are number one meme became on YouTube

135
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,030
It was such a wonderful thing to see in all the positivity that he spread around it

136
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,180
I thought it was a very nice thing to see how many people mean

137
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,860
Stefan in such a positive way after he's passing away as well

138
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,080
So I thought it would make sense to bring up on meme review.

139
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,420
It's time to go

140
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,600
Was I a good man?

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
No

142
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,080
I'm told you were the best

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,400
@Lushsux did an uh art piece for him

144
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,700
You either die a villain or you live long enough to see yourself become the hero

145
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,860
This is actually sad *sad laugh*

146
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,380
Stars are beautiful this evening. Yes. Do you know who else is beautiful?

147
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,980
No, who?

148
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,980
Stefan Karl Stefansson

149
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,760
Using the old format with Drake in it

150
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,400
Using the new improved format with Stefan Karl Stefansson

151
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,980
I think we should make this the default

152
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,710
there's also a petition going around

153
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,400
I recommend you guys sign it for uh

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,660
To raise a statue of Stefan Karl Stefansson in his hometown

155
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,600
You can't defeat me

156
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
I know but they can

157
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
Cancer Research UK

158
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,640
American Cancer Society
