1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
just a super quick update the nice that family has been doing an incredible job

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,000
of murdering this gigantic bucket of nutella here

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,210
not bad not bad that's a significant gap right there

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,439
we will have that thing empty by the end of the week

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,200
yeah

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
ok guys want to do that

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:39,650
kind of been freaking out a little bit because work work is my life it's like

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,700
my lifeline it's like my energy source buy happiness source work is my

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,720
everything

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,199
and since we got to Los Angeles there's just been so many variables like getting

11
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,949
situated in and the house and Candice have been sick the baby's been sick oh

12
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:52,940
and just got here

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,040
I haven't been as productive as i normally am productivity equals

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,030
happiness

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,250
a lot of productivity for me equals I don't know somewhere between absolute

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,200
frustration and rage and since I've been in Los Angeles I've been hovering

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
somewhere between the two

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,990
but that's going to change this morning I'm on my wearing out to meet a friend

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,140
of mine named Ryan Holliday

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,830

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,020
you should look him up and I are meeting to discuss this really big ambitious

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,570
project that we are just now embarking on a doing right

23

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,580
you know what in Los Angeles no ma'am you have to ask permission to sit here

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,210
we have commandeered this very private

26
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,800
almost cabana style area this fancy hotel for business meeting

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,100
I realized that being a little bit sketchy about not saying we're actually

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,100
doing but it's going to be big and it's gonna be exciting and this is right

god I feel so much better so it's a really just stimulating fantastic

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,250
conversation that really contextualized the project that he and I are about to

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,390
do

41
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,960
there's one thing that i wrote down with ryan is said to me before and this is

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,940
like a known that people say but never let perfect be the enemy of good enough

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,310
that principle really articulate what these logs are for me

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,080
prior to blogging is about maybe a movie a month or something like that in my

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,830
excuse for not being more prolific was always that I want what I make to be

46
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,269
perfect and I guess if you're stanley kubrick which in turn t know there is

47
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,470
validity in that argument but in retrospect that argument was just an

48
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,409
excuse for me to not make more

49
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,640
I no longer letting myself embrace that excuse I've forced myself to be more

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,220
prolific is via that proliferation via that increased output of my own medium

51
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:22,019
is movies then I found my voice and i found i think a renewed passion for what

52
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,300
has been my craft great eating

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
there's like this

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,520

55
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,990
