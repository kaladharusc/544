00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,250
hey guys welcome back to another episode

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,100
of bad unboxing fan mail I'm really glad

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,900
to have you guys here in the last

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,750
episode I was a bit slow lethargic

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,360
needless to say that wasn't enjoyable

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,220
for a lot of you guys to watch so in

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,620
this episode I'm changing things up a

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,210
bit number one I've been eating

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,070
healthier number two I've been avoiding

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,170
GMOs I think you guys might notice that

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,870
in my behavior I might seem a little bit

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,739
more normal

14
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,930
because my brain isn't being scrambled

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,239
by all the kooky chemicals in my food

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,970
and number three just having a more

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,370
positive outlook on life there's a lot

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,800
of drama here on YouTube and I'm sick of

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,680
it so without further ado let's just

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,390
open a box already okay we got some

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,420

face ah it probably shouldn't be sticky

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,410

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,209
behind me No

27
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,100
so far it's mostly junk stuff you know

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,750
there are some sweet letters amongst

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,700
both of them but the contents are just

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,899

I'm hungry the San Diego Padres are the

70
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,950
best baseball team in all of history

71

74
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,130
I'm a little green elf I'm a little

75
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,720
green elf I like to bust a move

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,070
feels like it's fucking coming to life

77
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,370
this is a creepiest doll I've ever owned

78
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,959
this is the only doll I've ever owned

79
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,880
I've never owned any other dolls than

80
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:14,799
this one this one says don't money shot

81
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,989
me on the outside of the box I kind of

82
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,970
don't like anything that's in here but I

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,880
have a new strategy and that is if

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,490
there's nothing obscenely disgusting

85
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,800
inside I'm gonna dump it out this thing

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,750
smells like shit and my nose is really

87
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,120
pressed up against it so you can trust

88
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,669
that so if you saw me walking down the

89
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,350
street and you're looking down and you

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:42,729
saw these pass by you like it's not

91
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,349
getting in your way at all like you

92
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,910
could actually probably still kick

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,559
someone's ass in these shoes

94
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,449
man I'm getting fucking home I'm taking

95
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,619

96
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:54,309
next box

97
00:04:54,309 --> 00:05:02,909
oh it's USPS packing supplies how great

98
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,489
it's a well-made mug that reads I can't

99
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,999
stop photoshopping my ass cheeks bigger

100
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,249
than they actually are in my Instagram

101
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,159
post that's pretty good I like that mug

102
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:16,989
I'm gonna take this thing off cuz I feel

103
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:19,509
like we've gotten as much use out of it

104
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:24,219
as we want Listerine zest nine volt

105
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:37,869
batteries fuck I'm her I'm hurting yeah

106
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:44,499
it's a lot of leaves and paper Jesus

107
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:48,489
Christ all for a fucking cookie jar well

108
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,109
thank you thank you for the Aunt Jemima

109
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:52,809
cookie jar I didn't ask for this there's

110
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:55,179
a fucking little pussy hole down here

111
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:57,369
I'm not sure what that's about Aunt

112
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,399
Jemima ceramic water dispenser with pump

113
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,299
so it's not even a cookie jar it's a

114
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:06,129
water dispenser what a massive

115
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:06,999
disappointment

116
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,069
well pink-haired Anna Mae your time has

117
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,479
come and Jemima is replacing you bitch I

118
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,179
picked up the sweet sangria candle with

119
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:19,359
the intention of hooking it through mrs.

120
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,359
Potts kidney area right here but I

121
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,959
hesitated I don't like that I hesitated

122
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:35,409
I don't like that this package right

123
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,049
here is very sad I almost don't want to

124
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,759
open it I almost just want to throw it

125
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,579
oh my gosh it gives me such a negative a

126
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,949
as a mom and it practically has nothing

127
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:47,139
inside I can't really tell what that is

128
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:54,009
oh that fucking reeks it's just a it's a

129
00:06:54,009 --> 00:07:01,610
fucking hmm it's basically a use

130
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,330
with a minion on it I want to at least

131
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,210
give you guys a preview it's you I can't

132
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,840
fucking describe this smell weed resin

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,810
ah it smells awful and it smells I think

134
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,610
that's the worst thing with all of these

135
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,310
bad unboxing I need a coin a term for it

136
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,930
you know how you go over to a friend's

137
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,660
house and the friend's house doesn't

138
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,630
innately smell disgusting but it is a

139
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,540
smell that you are not used to but they

140
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,790
live in that smell because that is

141
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,550
basically what all these boxes are every

142
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,200
time I open one of these boxes that

143
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,570
doesn't come from Amazon I'm opening

144
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,640
someone's home and I am smelling their

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,620
home and that is not a positive thing

146
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,690
all right guys that's going to do it for

147
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,150
this episode of bad unboxing a lot of

148
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,940
dud packages this time around but we got

149
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,730

150
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,400

153
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,400
yeah we're bringing that shit to them

154
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,159
mysterious ways

155
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,179
of playing along Nefario so while thighs

156
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:17,000
