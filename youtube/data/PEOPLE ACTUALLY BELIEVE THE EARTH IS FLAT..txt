And if Flat Earth wore pants, would it wear them like this?

Or, like this?

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,300
How clever.

I'd like to thank everybody who donated to- appreciate it. However, I made a few alterations to the campaign by raising

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,480
The original amount from $200,000 to a million because...

16

You wanted more money. I see what you're doing, B.o.B.

I would love to have a million dollars to prove that the earth is actually round. That would be great.

Check out the GoFundMe in the description guys, I think if we can finally set an end to this debate: together.

&quot;No, I'm pretty rock solid.&quot;

38
