00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,580
Hello everybody, my name is Markiplier and welcome back to Reddit's

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,900
50/50 challenge. Now, some of you may not know what this is about and consider yourself lucky.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,200
But if you don't, I'll explain it very quickly. This is true

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:21,360
50/50 mode on the 50/50 subreddit, which means that of the two options that are presented to me, like &quot;Cute Charmy the Bee,&quot;

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,900
or &quot;Dr. Robotnik rule 34.&quot;

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,700
That means if I click on this link, I will get one... or the other. But okay, let's try this

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,580
I don't know what I'm gonna see.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,480
AHH! IT'S DR. ROBOTNIK! AH! WHY!?
(Robotnik: *laughs* It's no use, give up!)

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,740
*internally and externally crying*

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,320
Oh-ho my god, why!?

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Why would someone draw that?

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,340
Why would someone put time and effort into drawing that?

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,940
(Because they can, Mark. It's the internet, get used to it.)

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,560
What would they do that? Why couldn't I've gotten cute Charmy Bee? Okay, do you get it?

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,260
Do you get the idea? Yeah, it's one or the other, and right now I'm only getting one. *chuckles*

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,940
Okay, here we go. I'm pos- I'm stalling for time because I don't wanna keep going, but here we go.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,100
&quot;A video of my dog rolling around in some grass,&quot; that sounds lovely, or &quot;My horrific sunburn.&quot;

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,260
That doesn't sound lovely.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,060
**gAsP***

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,700
IT'S A DOGGY! Oh! *giggles* Thank goodness!

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,900
Oh, thank goodness, look at the doggy!

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,760
Oh, look at you!

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Oh, look at you! (x2)

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,140
Oh, what a cutie! What a cutie patootie! What a cute- oh, look at that wag!

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,400
I needed this so badly! Purge Dr. Robotnik from my brain!

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,060
oOf

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,560
Okay OOf

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,000
&quot;English teen holds onto firecracker for too long,&quot;

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,900
oOF

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,460
&quot;Platypus eating from hand and getting belly rubs.&quot;

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,060
*mark makes faces of disgust*

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,560
**gAsP*** (x2)

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,300
It's the- *cracking up*

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,900
*literally starts dying*

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,940
It's the platypus! *chuckles*

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,220
Aren't you horrifically poisonous? Isn't that dangerous for the person? Like, aren't platypi extremely poisonous? (Only on the &quot;thumbs&quot;)

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,980
But look at the little toots! (what?)

38
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,500
Ooohoho, that's so cute

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,760
*mark is physically unable to english*

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,240
This title is just- WHAT IS THIS?

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,860
&quot;Grandma is set on fire on her birthday?&quot;

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,880
That's such a horrible sentence! On her birthday, grandma's birthday? Or baby panda trying to scape.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm guessing that means escape.

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,680
*orgasm*

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,900
G R A N D M A  NO!
N O O O O !!

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,240
Okay, that's enough of that! Don't spray silly string around fire! It's so flammable!

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,940
I wanted a baby panda trying to escape. Okay, &quot;Old man plays beautiful rendition of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' on a saw,&quot;

48
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,360
or &quot;Aftermath of circular saw accident.&quot;

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,600
*inhale*

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Oh, please, I just want to hear &quot;Over the Rainbow.&quot;

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,560
*music*

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,820
*orgasm (x2)*

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:17,020
*more music*

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,800
That's so nice!

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,100
*music continues, mark interrupting*

56
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,820
That's nice!

57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,940
That's so nice. Oh, that's nice. Oh, that's real nice

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,980
Oh that's real nice, oh, that's nice. Alright, that was nice. That was totally worth it.

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm so glad that I risked my sanity for seeing that, that was great

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,310
Alright, &quot;Man falls off motorcycle,&quot; or &quot;Man does cool vape bubble trick.&quot; Let's go

61
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,480
Ayy, it's bubble trick

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,460
Vape me! Vape it up! *MARK!*

63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,260
Wow! (x1)

64
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,860
Wow! (x2)

65
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,360
Wow! (x3)

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,820
Wow! (x4)

67
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,980
Wow! (x5)

68
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,480
Wow! (x6)

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,980
Wow! (x7)

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,960
Wow! (x8)

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,160
I don't like this. I don't like this whole phrase. &quot;Cute girl being poopy,&quot; *ew*

72
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,340
What does that-

73
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,240
What does that mean? &quot;Cute girl finds a puppy,&quot; or &quot;Cute girl being poopy?&quot; What kinda even sentence is that? *mark cannot english*

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:19,720
Wh-what phrase- what universe is that? Is that an apt description of what's happening in that content? *mark, you have no right to speak*

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,288
Oh, oh-

76
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:24,700
OHH NOOOOO! OHHH-

77
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,820
*mark regrets his entire life*

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,520
I know what they mean now by cute girl being poopy.

79
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
Ugh...

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Okay,

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,620
I'm not sure what this even means. &quot;Lion cub hugging mom,&quot; or &quot;Anime spider tooth vagina spitting webs.&quot;

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,460
Now, I've seen a few animes in my time.

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,220
And I have-

84
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:03,620
I have no idea what that might be, but I completely believe that it exists.

85
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,460
Oh~

86
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,200
*giggling*

87
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,660
Thank goodness!

88
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:17,920
Unless this is like a horrible mixture of the two. This is just lovely. I like THAT. That's good.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,620
Okay.

90
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,660
*quietly* What is this-

91
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:28,760
We've got &quot;Toto - Africa (Vocals one Step Out of Key &amp; Off Beat),&quot; or &quot;Toto by Africa-&quot; or &quot;Africa by Toto.&quot;

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,260
Alright.

93
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,580
*Africa starts playing*

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,060
Sounds like Africa.

95
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,560
I mean it's-

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,500
*OH GOD MY EARS*

97
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,240
(wait, wat)

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,440
*HUFF*

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
*finally realizes it*

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,340
(he got the off-key one)

101
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,100
*starts laughing as his ears are screaming at him*

102
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,820
Oh, god

103
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,340
*laughing in realization*

104
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,800
*moar laughter at the obvious off-key part*

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,380
*mark needs help*

106
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,540
Oh my god...

107
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,280
Oh my god!

108
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
*laughing*

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,860
Okay that's- I can't. I can't do that *laughing*

110
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,420
That's so bad!

111
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,400
You know, it's bad when me trying to read this in my head doesn't make any logical sense.

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,760
&quot;Dude puking blood into an empty skull, and drinking it again, all while wearing an octopus on his head,&quot; (ew)

113
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
OR,

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,130
&quot;How a liquid behaves when existing in all three phases at once.&quot; Now, me a science buff

115
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,280
I think that'd be cool to see.

116
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,900
I don't know why a dude is puking blood into an empty skull and drinking and all while wearing an octopus on his head, but

117
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,180
Here we goooooo

118
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,680
WHY-

119
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,980
Where did you get that octopus? Oh thank god. I'm just-

120
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,140
Why? WHY? WHY DOES THAT EXIST?

121
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:12,120
What- what- that looks professionally shot! 
Is there any way that I can get the other one? Cause I'm actually curious.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Oh, yeah. Look I got the other one. Now, what is this?

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
OOHHHH

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,780
oooooh

125
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,760
I don't know what tha- whaaa...

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,400
uhhh...

127
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,080
That's so cool!

128
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,320
What is that? Okay. Well, that was- that was fun. Alright, let's keep going. I guess some of these,

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
uhh... I-

130
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,360
Some of these I intentionally avoid, and it'll be pretty obvious why, cause I'm not here for

131
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,000
PORN...

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
and I don't want to see the alternative.

133
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,200
So if it's something like &quot;Girl with *Try not to laugh,*&quot; or &quot;Sliced up penis,&quot;

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm just gonna skate right by cause I don't need none of that. That is okay.

135
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:55,280
Uhh, how about this one. &quot;Police dog gives CPR,&quot; or &quot;Women angry over lack of cheese?&quot;

136
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,060
They both say safe for work.

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,140
Was it &quot;Police dog giving CPR?&quot;

138
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,260
*i don't understand these words*

139
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,280
*mark is amazed by the adorableness of doggo/pupper saving life*

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
That's such a good dog!

141
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,700
That's a- I love the little light on the back!
That's such a good dog!

142
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,680
Ohoho, you're such a good dog!

143
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,260
You did it! I love the light, you need the light, you need a wee-woo

144
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, that was so good. I don't know what the angry women over cheese thing was.

145
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,260
Oh. Oh, no.

146
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,460
Eugh. I have a funny feeling this ain't gonna be worth it. &quot;aftermath of man mauled by bear,&quot;

147
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:47,360
or &quot;My cat in a blanket.&quot;

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,860
**gAsP*** (x3)

149
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,860
It's a cat-- Oh my god I'm so relieved.

150
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,480
Ohh, it's-

151
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,860
This is like the- the pure adrenaline from- oh my god, I don't want to see it.

152
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh, it's just a cat!

153
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,730

Oh boy,

155
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:15,500
Alright saxophone- saxophone- another music one. &quot;Saxophone quartet plays the Mii Channel theme,&quot; or &quot;Horrible recorder cover of the Mii Channel theme.&quot;

156
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,920

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,660
How about this one? &quot;Cute fluffy doggy smiles at the camera,&quot; or &quot;Guy collects public used

170
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,840
property as part of his fetish and becomes one with it.&quot; *Oh dear*

171
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,200
*confusion at title*

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,920
*mouths* What?

173
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,360
What kind of fetish requires you to become one with public used property? Guess I'm gonna find out, aren't we?

174
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,960
*instant regret*

175
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:24,640

He was collecting poop. (x1)

186
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,720
He was collecting poop. (x2)

187
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,320
He was collecting poop. (x3)

Just want a happy one, you know. *Poor Mark*

191
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,350
I'd just like a happy one. &quot;Gangrene foot,&quot; or &quot;Small puppy.&quot; I'll take the small puppy, please, please

192
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,350
Can I have the small puppy? Can I get this?

193
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,920
**gAsP*** (x3)

194
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,840
That's nice. That's good. 
Okay, thank you.

195
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,480
*markimoo's heart melts at the puppo doing cute stuff*

196
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Thank you. I needed this so badly.

197
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,060
I needed this really badly.

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,080
It's a tiny adorable puppy and I love it.

199
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,800
I love it forever,

200
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,300
and I love it, (x1)

201
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,800
and I love it, (x2)

202
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,400
and I love it. (x3)

203
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,940
So I'm gonna end that there. That is Reddit's 50/50 challenge.

204
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,940
If you want to go down the rabbit hole of this horrible, horrible, horrible subreddit,

205
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,410
feel free. I'll put a link in the description.

206
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,800
You can turn not-safe-for-work off, but there are fewer submissions, obviously.

207
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,600
But you know, hey.

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,740
You know, pick and choose at your own risk, see what's worth it. Try to have fun, and...(emphasis on TRY)

209
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,220
*mark wants to die*

210
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,800
Thank you everybody so much for watching. Thank you for subjecting yourself to this with me,

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,620
or just watching me subjecting myself to horrible stuff. I mean, obviously I censored

212
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,540
the best of it

213
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,640
Oh, this is why it took over a year to do it again, yeah anyway, but thank you everybody so much for watching.

214
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,860
I hope you guys enjoy this, lemme know what you thought in the comments below whew, oh, man and, uh...

215
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,550
Thanks again for watching. Oh, and just FYI, if you're looking to support the channel, it's no longer called &quot;sponsorships,&quot;

216
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,000
they're now called &quot;channel memberships.&quot; The big sponsor button has changed to a join button. That's what that is.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So, if there was any confusion, hope that cleared it up. Thank you again everybody so much for being here.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,780
*inhale*

219
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,080
And as always, I will see YOU in the next video

220
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Buh-bye!
