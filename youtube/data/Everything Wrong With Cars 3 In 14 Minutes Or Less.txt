1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,160
45 seconds of logos okay

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,830
here we go focus speed I am speed movie

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,880
that goes back to the first film's

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,260
opening because it doesn't have anything

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,490
original to say also narration one

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,460
winner forty two losers this is the same

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,199
opening as the first movie - the show

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,710
crow that is for each area of this film

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,570
that used unreleased posthumous audio

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,980
for this character each of Paul Newman

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,600
salad dressings receives one cents

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,829
putting your movie title on a Jumbotron

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,899
is cute but kiss-cam still plays better

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,670
with crowds of all sports wow I realized

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,079
that it's pointless to start arguing yet

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,910
again how the hell works in this world

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,620
of talking cars if one car pulls in

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,149
between two cars like this it's pretty

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,920
much gonna come up right I mean this is

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,390
their physical body their skin it

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,860
essentially and this Chris just

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,120
squeezing right in between them probably

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,590
doing damage to the equivalent of major

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,879
organs just so he can watch a race

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,020
pretty sure cars for was going to be

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,430
about how cow has had enough that

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,820
becomes a serial killer hey Bobby

28
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,960
he's a next-generation race car

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
inexplicably voiced by Armie Hammer

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,590
better than you in every way but somehow

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,270
he was built added to the circuit and

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,500
enrolled in this race without you ever

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,820
hearing about him or the media even

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,799
knowing he existed until now who is this

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,350
mysterious newcomer Jackson Starr and

36
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,240
why is he so mysterious given his

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,740
existence represents a massive leap

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,020
forward in racing technology also naming

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,150
lightnings main antagonist storm is just

40
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,530
the amount of lazy I expect from Disney

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,100
these days

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,020
Jackson's storm is part of the next

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,509
generation of high-tech racers unlike

44
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,460
the veterans of yesterday know what

45
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,860
old-timers like this guy cars three get

46
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,670
off my lawn

47
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,530
storm achieves his top speeds by

48
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,810
exploiting the numbers I refer of course

49
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,070
to racing data Moneyball we've got six

50
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,020
or next generation rookies in the field

51
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,640
this is as good a time as any for me to

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,200
once again ask where these fucking cars

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,090
come from factories are they fitted with

54
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,590
personalities in a factory did two

55
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,150
former race cars have sex and create a

56
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,680
more advanced race car they're treated

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,060
like individual people but this whole

58
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,920
next-gen nonsense suggests that they're

59
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,360
just machines being created by some

60
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,830
big-ass god car in the sky

61
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,720
whether he's hanging up his lightyears

62
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,509
no no comment on that either good a

63
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,860
bunch of the Pixar creative staff get

64
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
together and decide that doing a movie

65
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,890
about retirement and getting older was

66
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,150
what the kids today wanted to see there

67
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,740
was more life and up which is a movie

68
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,150
that has an old retired guy as the lead

69
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,860
character thankfully when doc died it

70
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,330
was discovered his will specified that

71
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,860
any of the town's folk could enter his

72
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,330
garage and watch his old racing films

73
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,730
for inspiration your history movie pans

74
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,170
out its run time which is already too

75
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,790
long with archival footage of the Paul

76
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,650
Newman character just waiting for a CGI

77
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,709
grand moff tarkin to pop up randomly

78
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,630
again why because I'm sad and in Doc's

79
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,489
garage staring at old doc racing news

80
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,560
clippings you can either take it or you

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,630
can do what you've been doing sitting

82
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,800
aren't they always in the same position

83
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,450
so couldn't you argue that they're

84
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,739
always sitting because problem with the

85
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,239
Cars universe is that the dialogue is

86
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,680
full of humanistic expressions that

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,150
don't fit into the parameters of their

88
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,680
universe I get that after the reception

89
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,150
of the second Cars movie the creators

90
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,100
wisely realize that less mater is better

91
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,750
however couldn't they have tried no

92
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,299
mater I'm gonna be faster than storm I

93
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,190
need to train like them now you need to

94
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,870
be rebuilt to have 2% lower drag

95
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,760
coefficient and 1.2 percent higher top

96
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,530
speed he's literally better than you in

97
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,209
every way and you already use that turn

98
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,380
right to go left thing in the first

99
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,709

us this Knoxville

regular old real last Knoxville on your

way from Colorado to Florida this is the

109
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,329
most unnecessary fictional name since

110
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,579
mr. Tonka penis Luigi and Guido might be

111
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,079
the most culturally insensitive set of

up during pre-production they were

to someone else is this movie about

training crews or McQueen wait I just

169
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,860
realize how this movie's gonna end

170
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,870
also cars 3 is competing with rocky 4

171
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,680
for being over 60% montages

172
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,700
[Music]

173
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,590
well I'm no racing expert and much has

174
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,060
been made about the power of dirt on the

175
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,740
tires but maybe you should speed check

176
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,180
yourself on asphalt instead of sand

177
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,800
surface does make a difference you know

178
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,210
might be the first ever instance of the

179
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,010
street sign X not gonna sin that's what

180
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,520
I need to race against actual racers you

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
need 10 to 15 more miles per hour speed

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,940
you are not going to get it through

183
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,620
motivation I mean you probably will

184
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,060
eventually because this movie hates me

185
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,320
but you should not get it through

186
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,610
motivation this entire movie is

187
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,840
happening when they could have just

188
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,370
given him a new engine or something nos

189
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,940
[Music]

190
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,110
unless it rains or the mud flies off

191
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,050
while he's racing but semantics yep

192
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,490
Lightning entered a small crazy eight

193
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,930
track race without knowing it because

194
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,210
this movie has you by the balls also no

195
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,740
way and he can test his top speed on

196
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,140
this track FYI so basically he entered a

197
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,810
race and vigilante 8 I wonder how many

198
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,040
audience members shared the same

199
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,370
sentiment 10 minutes into this movie

200
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,970
goddamn shit bitch yet I'd like to ask

201
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,620
our editors Brad and Chris totally

202
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,090
different Chris by the way to find a

203
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,889
transparent PNG of a middle finger being

204
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,449
flipped and add it to the next couple

205
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,710
seconds of the movie footage while also

206
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,330
animating it with keyframes to slide

207
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,740
back and forth across the screen like a

208
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,900
windshield wiper okay

209
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,699
that's the I'm talking about them right

210
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,169
off the bat the school bus and RV

211
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,409
keeping up with lightning is bull I'm

212
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,849
glad this extended and utterly useless

213
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,889
country track Racine found time for yet

214
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,639
another callback to the first movie okay

215
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,530
it's not rain but I'm still right also

216
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,509
other than wait why would a former water

217
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,400
truck have water in its tank school bus

218
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,870
doesn't have kids in it the RV doesn't

219
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,250
have Robin Williams in it this should

220
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,870
actually be against the rules whatever

221
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,699
we need lightning to be exposed so what

222
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,650
shall be usually every mile of this trip

223
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,389
was to get me faster than Jackson's

224
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,490
storm I can't get any faster because I'm

225
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,430
too busy taking care of my trainer but

226
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,469
you chose all the destinations bro from

227
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:57,940
the beach to the country dirt track race

228
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,740
bitch now Cruz is just more selfish

229
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,060
behavior will just become the norm for

230
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,590
you god Lightning McQueen may be the

231
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,090
biggest dick of a protagonist in the

232
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,380
history of film ever because of you

233
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,400
because of him

234
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,710
really he's a selfish dickhead he won a

235
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,180
lot sure but this is like wanting to

236
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,560
become an NFL player because of Tom

237
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,800
Brady I used to watch you on TV flying

238
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,870
through the air was he on pole vaulting

239
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,250
with the car stars why would he be

240
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,630
flying through the air during a car race

241
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,599
being small crews that's what my family

242
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,259
used to say dream small or not at all

243
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,360
Cruz's family is a dicta Cruz I just

244
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,029
left it was my one shot and I didn't

245
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,010
take it well something tells me this bag

246
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,300
of cliches movie will give you that

247
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,560
chance to race you thought was gone

248
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,279
forever

249
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,320
lightning needs ten to 15 more miles per

250
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,850
hour to win this race so naturally he

251
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,170
calls mater for moral support

252
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,980
that's just it mater I don't know I feel

253
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,410
like I'm all out of ideas Pixar's new

254
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,260
slogan what I don't know

255
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,310
pretty sure an early screenplay a

256
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,630
meeting interaction just made it into

257
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,660
the script I'm sorry

258
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,220
some people actually like this movie hey

259
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,770
Cruz you want to check out the home

260
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,590
track of the greatest racer ever why not

261
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,030
we've got 40 more minutes to kill

262
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,920
somehow ok this animation right here

263
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,990
amazing I'm taking a sin off for a movie

264
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,250
I didn't enjoy because I'm all amazing

265
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,900
this is lightning slams on the brakes

266
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,580
here instead of just steering his car to

267
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,450
either side of this truck on the track

268
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,470
apparently these older cars just like to

269
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,030
sit around and a bar and listen to songs

270
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,130
about how old they are cars 3 might be

271
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,840
the saddest animated movie since Bambi

272
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,120
oh that's too short to take no for an

273
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,380
answer I'm sure this is the best message

274
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,690
for kids without some context everything

275
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,820
changed when the rookies showed up how

276
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,680
about that doc had the exact same thing

277
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,820
happened during his career that is

278
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,410
happening now - lightning what sweet

279
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,090
symmetry wonder if he did a sweet racing

280
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,710
move that lightning or someone coming

281
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,450
close will copy later in the final race

282
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,550
racing wasn't the best part of the

283
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,280
Hood's life you were Jesus they got on

284
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,360
the same page at the end of the first

285
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,720
movie

286
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,100
everyone in the world forgets the book

287
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,750
that is the second movie now suddenly

288
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,340
they had a father-son relationship off

289
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,050
screen between movies and lightning was

290
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,640
unaware of how happy this made doc until

291
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,050
he saw a newspaper clippings you'll

292
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,790
never be as fast as storm

293
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,590
finally someone says it but you can be

294
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,410
smarter than him what he literally takes

295
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,030
the optimum path on every lap and his

296
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:20,350
faster than all cars to sin to sin the

297
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,700
fact that he around this whole time and

298
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,410
miss qualifying the fact that this movie

299
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,970
feels he needs more obstacles to winning

300
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,410
than just a rookie car that literally

301
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,370
goes faster than him

302
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,990
a little really nothing he's done this

303
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,310
entire week has actually done anything

304
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,960
to benefit his desire to beat a much

305
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,680
faster car

306
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,090
this tractor version of house simba

307
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,530
killed his father is supposedly teaching

308
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,150
something to lightning supposedly yeah

309
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,420
that's when you were fast now you're

310
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,730
slow but couldn't they just add parts to

311
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,650
McQueen to make him faster I had to

312
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,210
repair him after the crash so why would

313
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,320
adding a better engine or something

314
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,090
along those lines be such a stretch no

315
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,900
lights

316
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,520
lights and instinct are not opposites

317
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,200
instinct discrete but even Sherlock

318
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,610
Holmes stubs his toe on something in

319
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,260
total darkness yeah yeah there's a Bruce

320
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,730
Almighty moon in the sky but this is

321
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,560
still some total crap also how is this

322
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,880
supposed to help this McQueen going to

323
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,590
be blindfolded in the next race does he

324
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,880
have to take down the Death Star because

325
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,040
his eyes can deceive him et called it's

326
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,040
not flattered Mac shares the sentiment

327
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,420
of anyone who watches this movie

328
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,770
Lightning has a crisis of confidence

329
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,420
right before the big race there are only

330
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,100
two ways this movie ends he regains

331
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,660
confidence touch that wall flip Trickett

332
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,820
docks and wins or he loses but finds

333
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,170
peace and retirement and starts training

334
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,760
Jackson's storm there may be cruise my

335
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,230
money is on the last one but either will

336
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,210
feel cheap but how is he catching up

337
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,680
with all these other cars they are the

338
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,300
same variety and build a storm then

339
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,340
wouldn't they be as fast as him got that

340
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,170
spoiler and those racing tires you look

341
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,070
ridiculous you are a trainer remember ok

342
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,140
now 100% certain lightning will accept

343
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,580
retirement and train crews thanks for

344
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,060
tipping your hand buoy they're not gonna

345
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,350
let you just replace yourself with your

346
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,690
trainer mid-race dude I mean wait the

347
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,900
Argo let him do that you're gonna finish

348
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,120
what so everyone wants to see McQueen

349
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,040
get his one last shot of glory but we're

350
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,840
now gonna have to watch cruise I don't

351
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,220
recall the rocky movie where after three

352
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,690
rounds rocky put his gloves on Paulie

353
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:21,500
and said go get him questions that could

354
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,240
be asked after the race do these cars

355
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,650
even understand the concept of a time

356
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,690
crunch also what makes cruises car type

357
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,070
able to compete with these new models

358
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,630
she looks like she's in the same class

359
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,370
as McQueen so how does she end up

360
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,810
winning this race especially when she's

361
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,950
so behind or or just put a headset on

362
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,660
McQueen since he's her trainer now and

363
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,070
yes they're gonna do that but only after

364
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,630
three of these tell her this moment's

365
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,430
cruise follows a psychological cliche of

366
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,080
picturing everyone is naked tractors to

367
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,760
get over her anxieties so she can win

368
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,050
the race movie has already shown her

369
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,430
passing more cars than her even in this

370
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,230
race

371
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,120
god damn it was this contractual and if

372
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,650
it was Pixar why did you agree to that

373
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,210
stipulation intentionally ramming

374
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,380
another car into the wall for our half

375
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,760
turn at the track should be illegal as

376
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,680
this is not bumping this is attempted

377
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,319
murder

378
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,179
here's that dock wall flip moon band I

379
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:08,769
wrote this movie screenplay in my sleep

380
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,989
as you know we have a long history of

381
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,660
great racers set for cow movie felt like

382
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,500
it had time for one more dig at cow

lightning to the winner's list before

386
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,069
the Jumbotron changed

387
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,429
he's fucking psychic you're the star of

388
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,929
the movie maybe you did some mediocre

389
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,489
racing earlier today does it really

390
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:27,759
matter

391
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,220
he decides when he's done racing that

392
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,589
was the deal oh yeah Sally

393
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:33,970
Jean was his girlfriend up until this

394
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,559
movie but I guess they had an amicable

395
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,389
breakup and remained friends this movie

396
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,859
treats Sally like any random Radiator

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,500
this test no point I just thought he

408
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,940
could stand to lose a little weight

409
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,790
yeah I do they're really important in

410
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,950
this pose that you arch your back and

411
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,680
keep it flat at the same time I feel

412
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
like those are opposing ideas
