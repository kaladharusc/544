00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,940
that's the DJI spark we got tiny it is

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:30,179
look how tiny is also this is it this is

3
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,710
the DJI spark

4
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,350
I wish there the way I could show you

5
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,580
just how small it is

[Music]

7
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,670
anything that doesn't do it justice you

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,260
have to hold the senior hand it is

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,079
fantastically small remember how small

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,390
the Mavic was when you first saw it this

11
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,570
thing is miniscule its tiny it is

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,080
smaller than the old tiny iPhone this is

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,680
my red jacket pocket phantom for spark

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,649
look at this look at this

15
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,409
could easily carry this around this is

16
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,289
the 747 this is the space shuttle that

17
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,920
flies on top of it all right now it's

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,780
time to get out of the studio and do an

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,479
actual performance test of this early

20
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,880
version of the spark there is one small

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,830
problem with testing us though and that

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,100
is that I'm under investigation by the

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,410
FAA and I can't fly in New York City

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,640
anymore so I don't want to get in

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,259
trouble and if you're responsible and

26
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,810
you shouldn't do it either so I got to

27
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,860
go somewhere where I can fly this thing

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:58,520
safely

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,649
boosted board is out of range I'm going

30
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,869
to need a better vehicle to get out of

31
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,259
the city to shoot this video

32
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,170
can I borrow swing do you have a car I

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,180
can borrow that matches my jacket this

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,660
one is that like the 458 Spyder has a

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,730
slightly better reign is just a little

36
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,739
bit quicker than the skateboard so I'm

37
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,170
headed out of the city now I just need

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,879
I'm going to go meet a friend who can

39
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,920
help me with the tech aspect of this

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,790
video review

42
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,330
we'll mark it slowly with a deck review

43
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,950
I'm gonna help you out yeah all right

44
00:02:46,950 --> 00:03:05,450
let's go oh god I don't know how to lock

45
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,250
okay Marquez just like everybody else on

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,430
planet earth has never seen the tiny DJI

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,760
spark before tiny like time you like

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,300
Mavic is pretty matted that's smaller

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,670
than your smallest cell phone that

50
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,560
that's a bomb that's the smallest drone

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,020
box that's an okay slide open Marco's

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:35,820
right oh you did not lie did not why is

53
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,620
that Wow

54
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,660
all right some very important

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,340
disclosures before I fly this thing for

56
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,770
the first time number one this is not a

57
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,050
paid review number two they were very

58
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,120
specific this is a prototype this is not

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,860
the final one the ones they ship is

60
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,209
going to be more perfected than this

61
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,410
number they don't actually have a

62
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,910
controller ready yet so I'm we can

63
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,620
filling this with my cell phone and see

64
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,480
this is not a complete review this is

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,250
just a first look to see what this thing

66
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,560
is like because this is unfinished to

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,459
hardware and software let's fly it do it

68
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:11,550
alright here we go take off

69
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:21,300
oh why nothing is super super steady

70
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,730
I mean it's wobbling but the shock

71
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,130
steady that's like saying foot

72
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,479
you never get this close to any other

73
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,420
drum

[Music]

75
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,730
the controls even just using a cell

76
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,160
phone are really really responsive it's

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
just like flying a regular big Mavic or

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,140
phantom but instead of having physical

79
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,370
buttons you're using the touchscreen

80
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,130
some other things it always use 1080 not

81
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,430
4k it has a two axis gimbal not a 3 axis

82
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,740
gimbal which means it goes up down and

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,160
it stabilizes the rotation axis got it

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,400
like this but it doesn't do this right

85
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,130
it doesn't turn

86
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,570
brave man

87
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,970
I'm a trusting that it's cable right

88
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,770
yeah rock-solid and there's a little bit

89
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,660
of grief this is the scene in the test

90
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,280
where I'm going to be pitting the tiny

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,550
spark again see slightly larger Mavic

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,710
we're going to use the Ferrari as the

95
00:06:37,670 --> 00:07:08,450
I think it's early around five six

96
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,910
hundred bucks its marketed for people to

97
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,890
take tip photos of friends and stuff

98
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,140
like that not like a hardcore little

99
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,240
lesson of film tool but more of a fun

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,520
tool exactly like it's meant for people

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,860
who've never own drum it's unbelievably

102
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,080
impressive I'm not being paid to say

103
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,870
that but I give it a fat thumbs up not

104
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,340
being paid to say anything either but

105
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,590
I'll have a more detailed comparison I

106
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,510
yes and definitely is that a plug for

107
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,190
your channel oh you should go check out

108
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,940
go check out marques channel links alone

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,940
that's it okay that's it but seriously

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,650
DJ I thank you for continuing to push

111
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,030
the boundaries of what's possible with

112
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,350
