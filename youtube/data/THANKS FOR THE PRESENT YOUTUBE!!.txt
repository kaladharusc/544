1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,720
who killed me

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,170
it's five six in the morning I and in dubai here in the middle east side of

3
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,910
some sort of sandstorm happening outside to leave this hotel now but applying out

4
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,380
of this lovely City at ten a.m. this morning so now i gotta pack up and get

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,380
out of this hotel room

6
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:58,250
watch how quick this camera box up that the model is out here

7
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,120
yeah

8
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,560
yeah

9
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,780
excellent session having allowed flight boards two minutes

10
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,920
dubai just want you to know what a lovely 24 hours it's been

11
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,880
I look forward to returning again sometime soon

12
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't have a window seat freak out of the window seat and trying to see this

13
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,810
is difficult with the general in charge

14
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,720
you just gotta believe that was fast you got to have things your shin

15
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,729
ok

16
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,890
yeah

17
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,220
yeah

18
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:39,040
is serious amenities kick this leg of the trip

19
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,990
like much longer than the last one this

20
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,440
13 or 14 hours so

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,040
trying to stay focused and not horse around like I did from New York to

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,330
divide the generalized gosh blood and then I

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,000
some work but mostly I'm gonna focus on sleep

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,590
look at lunch looks

25
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,910
absolutely these

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,010
flights on the airplane nothing more

27
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,150
real excuse to sit down

28
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,409
dislike the play also is not a special party atmosphere as the previous flight

29
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:22,140
right beside i couldn't vote this is 40 jahre little brownie ID these snacks for

30
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,079
days

31
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,819
have you ever been on one

32
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,819
these places with the bar

33
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,120
anyone trix are coming too

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,750

37
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,780
the child was an interesting people

38
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,830
the pot is just like the fun spot where we're going to play

39
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,580
seven hours into the flight eyes that most of that time sleep

40
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,850

41
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,290

possibly travel to the other side of the planet and bring their own skateboard I

87

did actually bring my own skateboard the other side of the planet but it's still

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,310
thoughtful

89
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,360

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,789
rehearsals and things like that

98
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,060
yeah I'm super super excited about it a lot of people don't really know how to

99
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,690
structure these episodes for that I went there so many time zones that today's

100
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,850
tomorrow but this morning was actually yesterday so this isn't like a full day

101
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,180
but it has been 24 hours confusing i know i'm just going to go ahead and end

102
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,760
it right

103
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,699
yeah

104
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,699
hotel they might be like

105
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,699
plus you've got a bouncer at either entrance

106
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,050
there are no bouncers on the plane
