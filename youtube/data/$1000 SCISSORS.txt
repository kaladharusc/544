ya know

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,580

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,000
this is a good boutonniere this is very Nucky Thompson

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,770
yeah how much you taken i'm going to just going to clean around the edges so

20
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,110
you kind of like look good for photo anyway

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,110
ready yeah these are serious

22
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,640
a thousand dollars really yeah if you cut hair and you use like a

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,149
two-hundred-dollar scissor vs this you can see a huge difference

24
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:09,789
we're getting the tuxedo ready and then we're going to leave and we're going to

25
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,060
do the actual photo shoot in the street somewhere

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,420
that's the details have not been figured out yet but I do know that there is in

27
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,420
the escape were involved and

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,020
that purple deep that's going to be the chase card probably chased me around in

29
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,020
and shoot photos under the back room

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:37,580
headed down to like Wall Street area to take this picture through some tests

31
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,420
photos now that's the situation looks like it's kind of ridiculous but

32
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,640
yeah

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,330
where in midtown now trying to get the shop but traffic is really making a

34
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,420
difficult

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,700
see I'm trying to skate board up the middle of the day that within the law

36
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Cameron

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,260
drivers in midtown are crazy

38
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,400
don't know much but I do you know the driving the back of the Jeep like this

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
to midtown Manhattan is against the law

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,980
it

41
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:39,430
ok all you follow - nice to me but let's get you out of here safely

42
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,090
okay all right up to the end

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,380
all right anything broken I was quite sad your bike your body all right yeah

44
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,030
it's just your handlebar his bikes broken but the more important thing is

45
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,070
that the the second skill to have a white

46
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,430
he was no I got him he's not going to work something out the way

47
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,430
take care thank you take care of them

48
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,420

I don't know how you did it for that many years I don't know

they put it on the menu vote if you need to put that in your head right

87
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,680
however this is like it my own concoction like the secret menu in and

00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:50,569
support

92
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,080

95
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:07,610
our enemy is its past right

96
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,600
it's fast we're dressed all right all right give that up

97
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,090
No

98
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,090
that proves it - faster

99
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,849
yeah

100
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,620

102
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,110
really

103
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,680
yeah

104
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,910
just you know it effectively against the law to skateboard on the west side

105
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,240
highway
