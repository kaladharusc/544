1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,170
Hilary Clinton I will be voting for

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,290
Hillary Clinton I avoid talking politics

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,290
on this channel on this forum because

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,639
politics are divisive there's always two

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,760
sides Republicans and Democrats there's

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,740
left and there's right I can have my

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,150
opinion and there will always be an

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,100
opposing one that is the nature of a

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,289
healthy democracy but this is not that

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,449
this is about a megalomaniac who's

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,150
driven by nothing but ego a man who

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,000
cares exactly zero about the people of

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,010
this country a person who brags about

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,989
sexually assaulting women and shames

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,969
others for the way they look I'm

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,590
speaking up now because this election

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,680
has very little to do with politics

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,870
policy or legislation this has to do

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,510
with morals and principles I'm voting

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,579
for Hillary because make no mistake

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,949
there is only one person that can defeat

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,110
him one person that can keep him away

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,690
from power and it is her I'm not a huge

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,940
fan of her stale politics I'm entirely

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,980
aware of all the criticism against her

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,690
I'm aware of all of her failures and

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,489
shortcomings but she's intelligent and

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,740
she knows what she's doing more

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,110
importantly she's mentally sound she's

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,680
responsible and she's saying I want to

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,810
end this by calling out all the big

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,330
youtubers some I know and some you

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,369
viewers might know see making videos

34
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,350
like this they're not popular they're

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,880
not going to get you subscribers they're

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,799
not gonna boost your view counts but

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,020
there is something much more valuable

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,049
than subscribers or dollars and that's

39
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,020
backbone that is not being scared to

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,090
stand up for what is right regardless of

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,369
the costs the top 20 youtubers reach

42
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,159
over a billion views every single week

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,979
every seven days we have the power to

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,960
activate a demographic an electorate

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,600
that isn't typically very active that is

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,689
young people you see this generation if

47
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,030
we're all banded together we have the

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,540
power to ensure that this tax avoiding

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,350
lying racist misogynist stays away from

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,200
power and out of the White House but it

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,439
requires all of us coming together so if

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,899
your favorite youtuber says things like

53
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,910
I don't like to talk politics on my

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,740
channel or

55
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,090
I'm not going to reveal who I'm voting

56
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,420
for call them out sitting on the

57
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,880
sidelines this time around is not okay

58
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,760
this election is different and if this

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,280
guy gets elected and you stood back with

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,930
your arms folded and didn't speak out

61
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,210
against him it makes you complicit it

62
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,610
makes you partially responsible for

63
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,390
handing him the reins of power all right

64
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll see you tomorrow for a fun happy

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,470
video thank you for your understanding

66
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:49,170
and thanks for the time

67
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,000
you
