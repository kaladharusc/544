hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic I

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,000
remember it so you don't have to the

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,190
Powerpuff Girls

6
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,539
well I can't say I grew up with the show

7
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,190
I think I was entering college at the

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,140
time I can say I'm quite familiar with

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,750
it because well it was everywhere my

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,219
first introduction to it was a Space

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,079
Coast cartoon showing pilots for there's

12
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,539
a new channel Cartoon Network well it

13
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,430
looked a little different that does now

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,109
it was still unlike anything I've ever

15
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,239
seen it was like a mix between Ren and

16
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,640
Stimpy and anime it was uniquely bizarre

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,050
and adequately funny

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,360
the popularity grew so much that Warner

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,679
Brothers eventually gave them their own

20
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:14,190
Powerpuff Girl movie the Powerpuff Girl

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:22,470
movie being the first theatrical release

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,420
from Cartoon Network this superhero

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,700
beat'em up got an astounding okay

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
response from critics and received an

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,140
amazingly adequate box office and the

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,890
response from viewers was a phenomenal

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,860
school nobody really talks about this

28
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,840
movie too much and on some level I can

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,390
see why kind of just shows up does this

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,220
job and then leaves your consciousness

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,660
kind of like fish but is there more to

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,369
analyze about this movie is there

33
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,989
something to recognize beyond just

34
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,789
distracting you for an hour and a half

35
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,379
let's hope not or else the Madea movies

36
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,420
will have nothing to survive on so slap

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,099
on your white socks and act like having

38
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,660
no fingers or toes is part of being a

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,030
kindergartner I'm glad somebody else

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,830
have that childhood this is the

41
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,039
Powerpuff Girls movie ah back when

42
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,720
Warner Brothers the pan and scan would

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,050
be the future I miss you I soars in the

44
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,670
city of Townsville crime is on the rise

45
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,860
as well as narrators talking about how

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,800
crime is on the rise for there is a man

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,879
who looks back to a sweeter time

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,430
everything was nice when women's eyes

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,019
weren't black and white cookies the

50
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,840
world has changed this man the narrator

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
simply calls the professor tell me

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,110
there's a fan theory connecting these

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,940
two goes home to conduct an experiment

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,620
while his lab monkey starts wreaking

55
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,030
havoc

56
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,530
hey hey it's how some fans react to the

57
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,420
new Powerpuff Girls cartoon with a weird

58
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,100
name like that he won't go anywhere

59
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,530
the monkey spills chemical X into the

60
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,550
mix and well using the opening don't

61
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,500
look at them too long I think the ring

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,200
video is in their eyes

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,210
yeah like many of us say their look can

64
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,700
be a little night terror ask but they're

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,380
cute personalities do shine through the

66
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,210
more he interacts with them I can't

67
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,750
believe it

68
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,950
I wanted to make some kids that liked it

69
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,480
each good and bad right and wrong and in

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,890
turn maybe they do some good for this

71
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,930
terrible town and now I can it's nice

72
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,850
knowing the motivation after he did the

73
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,490
motivational thing he quickly finds out

74
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,830
that they have superpowers thank God for

75
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,170
this slow pan over to Chemical X or else

76
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,640
we never would have found out what did

77
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,040
it except for the other times you

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,300
focused on it and the fact that's

79
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,560
repeated over and over and the show's

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,210
opening credits I think kids can connect

81
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,540
the dots what the stupid was affected to

82
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,670
and abandons them for the time being the

83
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,290
girls help the professor do everyday

84
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,390
things like paint their room bring in

85
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,190
toys and even put in some windows I

86
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,380
could see some windows I'll call a

87
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,830
contractor tomorrow it didn't know Satan

88
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,110
sonam at everything nice you will also

89
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,660
see does Cookie Crisp before bedtime the

90
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,560
dog is cute it looks like they're laser

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,300
eyes make the windows and all this

92
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,430
oddness tires them out so they're put to

93
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,870
bed while the professor comes across a

94
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,380
picture they drew

95
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,030
okay the peachy promised me non-stop

96
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,400
frenetic animated action which sounds

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,810
more like a critic quote than a warning

98
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,910
but you come through what my parental

99
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,400
guidance is required the next day he

100
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,450
takes them to school and they're

101
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,060
introduced to their teacher miski why

102
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,830
does every kid's eyes look like buffalo

103
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,810
bill should be staring down them do you

104
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,190
think they'll be okay because they're

105
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,460
really special I mean really special

106
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,070
don't worry we take all kinds of kids

107
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,300
but that one the corner for example

108
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,450
hasn't blinked in days it still haunts

109
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,510
my soul the kids seem to fit in fine

110
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,290
until they play a game of tag what's

111
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,280
going on here

112
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,990
wait puppets testicles dropped at an

113
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,360
early age the kids show the girls how to

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,700
play and they take it well a little too

115
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:08,950
seriously

116
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,200
Popples recovers and the girls use their

117
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,970
superpowers to play the game destroying

118
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,400
chunks of the neighborhood well the

119
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,720
video games designed what other

120
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,210
merchandise do we have to make so okay

121
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,730
well this is a cute idea it goes a

122
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,150
little long like a lot a little long the

123
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,710
whole tag sequence from beginning to end

124
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,830
is nine minutes nine minutes it's like

125
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,300
imagining one of those pointless fight

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,070
scenes in the Matrix Reloaded except to

127
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,510
make it even more pointless they're just

128
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,350
playing tag

129
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,450
you're Garrett you're here and you're it

130
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,060
you're it gara gara gara well to point

131
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,170
toward Yuri Jada granted the action is

132
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,880
kind of creative but there's no conflict

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,440
outside that people just want them to

134
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,390
stop playing tag that's a superhero

135
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,190
movie even for kids that's not

136
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,380
especially exciting this makes me laugh

137
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,800
though you know I've got a nice guy I'll

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,270
just assume by that like I'm screaming

139
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,140
both people are dead

140
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:14,199
[Music]

141
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,940
the fine thing is man a steel fan

142
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,350
somehow interpret this as saving the

143
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,080
city the mayor of Townsville sees the

144
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
destruction and in an almost minute and

145
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,300
a half filled up to a joke I like to

146
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,340
play the long game in this he gets a

147
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,900
pickle instead of responding to the

148
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,880
violence back when a politician doing

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,910
that almost sounded silly

150
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:39,690
[Music]

151
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,910
that classic mayor slowly putting pickle

152
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,650
closer to his mouth while sweet girls

153
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,360
destroying the city quickly rushed

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,250
towards you I don't care how long you

155
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,890
take to film it the routine is timeless

156
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,360
the girls eventually crashed into him

157
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,950
and the professor runs into the girls

158
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,720
finally taking them home three little

159
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,480
girls had a very busy day today well I'm

160
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,070
glad you had so much fun because

161
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,380
tomorrow will be a busy day too we're

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,420
going to explain to truthers why what

163
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,010
you did wasn't planned by the government

164
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,890
it's your super powers I don't think you

165
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,080
should use them in public anymore just

166
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,610
give Townsville a little time to

167
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,830
understand your specialness we're gonna

168
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,330
try and eat frozen to this but the

169
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,360
earworm we have is a literal earworm

170
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,580
people often get scared or angry when

171
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,380
they don't understand something special

172
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,970
or unique that's silly

173
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,880
well I think so too oh and you blue

174
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,390
up kind of a legit reason to get mad the

175
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,950
news spreads through town and the next

176
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,600
day the kids are not greeted with much

177
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:46,960
warmth well that PG rating did not

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,630
include Yosemite Sam language the

179
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,890
professor is brought in for questioning

180
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:57,060
leaving the girls alone after school

181
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,610
maybe he hates us and here I thought ed

182
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,170
Helmes was the worst thing to happen to

183
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,810
tag has more news spreads about them

184
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,120
shocking even mini ron jeremy the girls

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,160
feel like outcasts

186
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,480
don't worry the invention of social

187
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,940
media will balance everything out there

188
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,500
is something I like about them not using

189
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,540
their powers to go home realizing what

190
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,520
it's like to be a normal person living

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,140
through their destruction things get

192
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,340
even more intense when they're stopped

193
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,550
by a local gang you know just because

194
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,810
the guy new member doesn't mean the

195
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,290
guerillas need to do crossovers but

196
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,479
they're saved by you know and they

197
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,370
follow him to a box he lives it have

198
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,530
been lashed by heart that's disgusting

199
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,810
because you are he says his name is Jojo

200
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,180
and like them he's an outcast heads up

201
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,350
this is my favorite shot in the movie

202
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,630
and if you just give people time they'll

203
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,430
start to understand your specialness

204
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,090
yeah you just gotta believe in yourself

205
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,440
mmm that's entailing a bottom Carter as

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,020
a monkey look so creepy so funny enough

207
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,970
the movie goes from a snail's pace to

208
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,250
suddenly pretty damn fast when Jojo

209
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,170
reveals his ideas and how the girls can

210
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,480
help John then take this device I built

211
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,700
into the volcano losing my ideas are

212
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,260
your powers we will build to help the

213
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,520
town to make it a better place machine

214
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,380
Jesus the micro machine guy took over

215
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,110
his editor they agreed to help Jojo with

216
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,790
his plan to repair the town even though

217
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,590
they don't understand what the machine

218
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,840
they're making does as a reward he takes

219
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,550
him to the zoo but he seems to have

220
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:40,390
other plans than just sightsee it's

221
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,720
funny because butts always wanted to go

222
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,610
to commercial on that line

223
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,580

Jojo starts his evil plan transporting

279
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,350
all the monkeys from the zoo to his lair

want to talk about something

286
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,760
their brains all seem to grow as the

287
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,110
next morning both the kids and children

288
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,820
will prepare for their big day

289
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,440
the girls things are gonna help the town

290
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,820
but they accidentally caused the

291
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,590
apocalypse oops

292
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,050
Jojo think it's the best introduction to

293
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,610
a new name since the artist formerly

294
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,660
known as Prince

295
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,820
the hobo formerly known as Jojo is no

296
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,220
more from this day forward I shall be

297
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,470
known as that's so funny I totally

298
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,850
glanced over that there's two weird

299
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,620
focuses on butts in that shot again

300
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,160
movie you want to talk about something I

301
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,420
don't know who to believe I thought you

302
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,260
were good

303
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:05,600
e to profess a but Mojo Jojo finds out

304
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,250
his minions want to be in charge instead

305
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:19,580
of his my name is and here is my speed I

306
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,880
don't remember getting high but I'm

307
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,630
clearly high I think it was brave to

308
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,370
have the makers of Dexter's Lab do the

309
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,570
pink elephant scene in Tim Burton's

310
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,720
Dumbo sprite can be better than what

311
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,240
we've really yet meanwhile on Planet

312
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,610
artsy cut away your Powerpuff Girls that

313
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,240
tree of life the girls seem to sit on a

314
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,520
I'll just say it I have no idea what

315
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,900
maybe it's the debris of the town

316
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,700
flowing into space maybe it's where

317
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,380
Marvin the Martian lives maybe it's all

318
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,000
the sets to the Superman sequels that

319
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,290
are never gonna make but whatever it is

320
00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:01,810
they try to figure out what to do

321
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,090
what is this a Swedish expressionist

322
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,580
belches punch yet but they hear the

323
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,130
professor cry in pain despite he's kind

324
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,390
of the reason they were up there to

325
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,810
begin with

326
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,730
and they rushed back to Salem on the way

327
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,330
they find they can save other people too

328
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,620
that's my cat's favorite scene you

329
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,770
should see the look on his face that's

330
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,950
the face he makes but Buttercup punch is

331
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:34,900
one of them and they get an idea that's

332
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,380
what'll save the day we had to do so

333
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,839
many PSAs to balance this out wait

334
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,310
that's not a thing when this was made

335
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,960
oh good just blow up to blow

336
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,710
up I'll just say it it's really weird

337
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,200
but really awesome to see this much

338
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,690
animated violence in a kid's film again

339
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,400
I don't think I've seen this much

340
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,350
hand-drawn explosion punching for

341
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:10,610
children since GI Joe the movie

342
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,950
but gotta say the professor from Mojo

343
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,930
Jojo but he turns himself into a giant

344
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:24,079
because Giants are cool well somebody's

345
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,630
found a new beer label the girls of

346
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,920
course trying to stop him leading to

347
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,480
even more fun action ones who hated you

348
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,820
the ones who are clearly artists and

349
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,860
writers trying to get their faces in the

350
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,450
picture I haven't looked it up or

351
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,670
anything but look at them that's clearly

352
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,050
drawn by people eleven sense of humor

353
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:55,010
about how they look well that's a shock

354
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,839
I really thought they were gonna join if

355
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:57,680
do you think these are Mission

356
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,230
Impossible twist they defeat him just as

357
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,700
the professor comes up with an antidote

358
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,680
to shrink him down the girls even have a

359
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,420
chance to take away their powers but the

360
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:12,709
town wants them to keep thank you oh my

361
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,209
god you can talk so the town loves them

362
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,279
now and lets them fight evil wherever it

363
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,510
works Powerpuff Girls hey that's a good

364
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,790
name for them I like that

365
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,040
I wonder if they will I wanna try it I

366
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,200
mean I was gonna go with creepy sperm

367
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,380
dolls but I guess that works too

368
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,000
the Powerpuff Girls movie has a strange

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,120
problem of taking itself too seriously

370
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,320
which is fine if you want to try

371
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,090
something new but it needed a more

372
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,370
complex story with twists and emotions

373
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,170
when the action the comedy does get

374
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,890
going though

375
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,990
it is kind of fun it's not as fast or

376
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,820
creative as the show but the up to

377
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,650
production value does make it nicer to

378
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,870
look at especially for a time period

379
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,580
when this kind of style just wasn't seen

380
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,440
in movies nowadays this kind of

381
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,390
simplistic style with fast action is all

382
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,070
over the place but back then this was

383
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,870
pretty rare so I guess you could argue

384
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,790
on a technical level it was a little

385
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,680
ahead of its time as a movie though

386
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
that's all right I would have liked if

387
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,190
it was a bit more clever in its writing

388
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,350
but it still felt big enough to be more

389
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,750
than just an extended episode fly on in

390
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,160
and check it out for yourself

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,330
I mean it's got to be better than next

392
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,780
week's movie what are your thoughts on

393
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,170
that Chaplin I think that face says it

394
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,300
all

and those in need they do this by

406
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:20,210
creating and supporting unique programs

407
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,690

strengthen and build communities the

409
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,139
experiences of War leave an indelible

410
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,899
impact on our defenders when they return

411
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:32,149
to civilian life the physical emotional

412
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,519
and psychological challenges they face

413
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,220
are often difficult as citizens we

414
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,899
benefit from the freedom and security

415
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,720
they fight to protect so supporting our

416
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,149
heroes is a responsibility we all should

417
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:46,369
share each of the foundation programs

418
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,499
originated from Gary Sinise's personal

419
