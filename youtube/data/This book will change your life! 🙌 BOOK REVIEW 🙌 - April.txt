Book review

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello everybody. I'm back. Did you think I forgot?

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,780
No, I didn't.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,060
I just been not doing my homework.

(excuse me in japanese)

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,900
I am sorry. When I was in Japan last month,

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,020
i didn't really have much chance to read I

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,689
I knew my time there was limited. So I really just wanted to focus on

12
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,250
Being in Japan. There's been a lot of news articles about book club.

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,300
I don't know if you read them. But so- some of them are great.

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,000
Just praising the idea that

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,350
uhhhh..

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,940
Obviously getting more people into reading a British bookstore a very very big British bookstore

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,960
they had a select table of books and there were all books that I had reviewed and

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,059
It made me think wow, it

19
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,320
definitely had an influence on sales if they

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,390
feature these books in in a specific way

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,300
It's not like they'd said Pewdiepie Isle

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,493
or anything like that,

23
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:01,289
but it's cool. Should I force anything else positive into this before

24
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,620
I begin? I don't think we need to do that. Thank you.

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,320
??

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,450
Now, first book I read was the &quot;Dice Man.&quot;

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,470
Written by Luke Rhinehart this was suggestion by Brad

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,720
Hooray for Brad Thank You Brad for suggesting

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,680
A lot of you guys suggested this book as well and I can definitely see why. I think Brad told me that he read it

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,580
when he was younger and I

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,280
Think it's the kind of book I would probably appreciate

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,299
If I was younger as well not saying that it's stupid or anything like that

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,760
It's just it has a lot of flaws that I thought was a bit hard to

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,160
Over- oversee is that how they say it (overlook) doesn't matter. The book is written by Luke Rhinehart who is also

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,700
Conveniently the protagonist. Mmm how strange. It follows a story of Luke who is a

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,070
Psychiatrist he's very successful. He earns a lot of money. He has his wife

37
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,540
He has his kids, but he just doesn't feel happy where he is in life

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,000
His best friend is advancing before him even though he's not as clever as he is

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,630
He just feels stuck in a rut basically so in a drunken idea

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,920
Late at night. He decides that he's going to roll a dice and if it lands on a six

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,610
I think it was a six. It doesn't matter

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:21,470
he is going to rape his best friend's wife who has been sort of flirting with him a little bit and

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,920
Here it sort of shows how amateurish the writer is or maybe just needs a better editor. I don't know

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,530
There's really no reason for him to want to rape his

45
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:38,230
Best friend's wife. I understand that he needs to undergo this drastic change of character, but they justify it as &quot;Oh well

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,760
&quot;she- she liked it more than I did&quot; *weird noise*

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,440
I feel weird i've been talking about it and it's not like I'm prude or anything like that

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,670
But nevertheless this event has such a drastic change of his character that he becomes the dice man

49
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,040
And he decides to live his life by the roll of the dice

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,190
he will write down a couple things that he wants to do and a couple of things that he doesn't want to do and he

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,290
place them on the number of the dice

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,000
So if it rolls a 1 or a 2, he'll do this two to three or four he'll do this

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,980
five or six he'll do this, so that determines his life and it's interesting in a way how that makes him break free from his

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,260
Rut essentially his character that's just too comfortable. A lot of times

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,280
it's obvious what you want to do and you always go for the obvious choice and

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,050
he explains that the dice man as

57
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,010
You there's so many things that you miss out on by not doing and

58
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,030
that never gets to live because you always go with the obvious choice and by

59
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,090
Constantly going with the obvious choice you may end up too comfortable and in the way that Luke was in the beginning of the novel

60
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,530
Luke really decides that he's going to push this for

61
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,600
Scientific purposes or for his studies. He's going to push the limit of the dice and

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,860
Following the dice as a godly figure to its very limits. It's not like the whole idea of flipping a coin is anything new

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,690
it's not like there's anything that

64
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:11,450
Special about it, but it becomes a cult and he becomes a cult leader of that of the dice. It's an interesting concept of

65
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,380
self-control also letting go of that control to something else and while reading it I was feeling

66
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,820
Like I want to try this out when I was in Japan, for example

67
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,530
Me and Marzia a lot of times the things that we enjoyed the most were not the we had planned for

68
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:34,420
but things that we just happened to stumble upon which I think is why what it's trying to get at. The book very

69
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,200
Confidently says on the cover. This book will change your life

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,690
It won't. I really enjoyed it at the first half but the second half was just

71
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,160
Unnecessary, I think it tried too hard to be commercialized

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,760
The story takes almost like a movie like plot

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,370
The FBI is after him and there's just so many sex scenes in this book

74
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,720
I think there's like 30 sex scenes in it and it just became cringe-worthy after a while

75
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,390
I'm like, this is just ridiculous. At the end of it

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,130
it sort of made me question the

77
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,300
the skill of the author and if the concept of the dice was even that great to begin with. It just seems so like some sort

78
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,190
of pseudo-psychiatry and

79
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,260
who knows? maybe that's what it was trying to mock anyway. Next! I read &quot;Stoner&quot; by John Williams.

80
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,860
This was a book that when he came out it barely sold anything, but then later- fifty years later

81
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,390
It got translated and it picked up in popularity. Now,

82
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,400
it's very highly regarded.

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,860
When I explain my favorite novel to people, or at least a novel that I really enjoyed, a lot of times I met with

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,160
a skeptic look like:

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,729
&quot;That doesn't sound interesting at all!&quot; What are you talking about? A good testimony of a good writer is that if you can tell a

86
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,900
seemingly uninteresting story and captivate your your reader

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,600
That's a great way to test it

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,540
And I think Stoner is exactly that. Now I was reading this and I kept thinking

89
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,740
&quot;When is the punchline coming?&quot;
&quot;When is the weed joke coming?&quot;

90
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,310
I was on page

91
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,940
420 and I realized, &quot;I've just spent hours reading a boring book about a boring man's life!&quot;

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,240
It has nothing to do with weed. Not a single weed reference. I'm just kidding. Obviously. It's actually a really great book

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,520
I really enjoyed reading it

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,520
It follows a story a William Stoner, which can be summarized as &quot;Life sucks, and then you die.&quot;

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,140
&quot;So fuck the world and let's get high! 420 everybody!&quot; It's so cringe-worthy jokes. I'm sorry.

96
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,630
William Stoner grows up on a farm. He goes to study agriculture and

97
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,850
a part of his study

98
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,990
he- it's obligatory to study English literature and he completely falls in love with it and he loves- and he switch

99
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,430
his studies completely to literature instead of agriculture and

100
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,090
At the day of his graduation, he very selfishly

101
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,930
Tells his parents, &quot;I'm not coming back to help at the farm. I'm going to keep studying to become a teacher.&quot;

102
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,520
I can't relate to that at all.

103
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,900
I escaped to Italy to become a youtuber and abandon my studies

104
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,720
so maybe I can't fault Stoner too much in this. It sets the swing of

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,840
The story in of Stoner's life whenever something positive happens to Stoner so- it's met with something negative.

106
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,720
he falls in love with literature, but at the cost of

107
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,830
Disappointing his parents. He falls in love with a woman and they get married very quickly

108
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,980
But then he discovers that she's actually very horrible to him and they don't match at all.

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,610
So anytime something positive happens to Stoner, it's met with something negative.

110
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,250
He loves teaching his students at school, but it becomes very hard for him to do so

111
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,780
because of the department. He gets a daughter that he loves very much and care for but the daughter

112
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,860
After a while sort of turns against him because of his wife

113
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,460
It just keeps on rocking back and forth for Stoner and you just have to, when reading it, you can't help but appreciate his immense

114
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,660
stoicism and

115
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,860
How much he endures of

116
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,460
bad behavior from other people that just

117
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:16,080
brings him down. You just want to pat Stoner on the back and say &quot;It's okay you did your best, man&quot;.

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,940
I always try and find some sort of

119
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,120
ideas in there. I don't know if I'm right or wrong

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,020
But the way I saw it is that there's two sides of the coin in life.

121
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,200
You're gonna be happy sometime and you're gonna be

122
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,060
unhappy sometime and you can

123
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,960
just hope that you end up on one side more than the other just because you endure a lot of pain and a lot of

124
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,020
Bad behavior and just because you're a good person and work really hard for the things you love that doesn't necessarily mean

125
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,470
Happiness is some sort of reward or something that's owed to you. It just- doesn't work like that.

126
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,899
That's just a state of life

127
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:57,600
And that's the balance that we all have to go through. Stoner dusted in such grace and the way he endures it all

128
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,999
You just- you can't help but look up to him and his character. In a lot of ways

129
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:06,199
he's a hero and I think that's how the author described him as, as an angel in the end.

130
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,769
It's a fantastic read. I really enjoyed it. From start to finish,

131
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,620
I think this was a novel that I found the easiest to read and

132
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,020
flow through so if it sounded interesting give it a go. Next up, we have &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot;

133
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:27,520
It's a classic, you've definitely heard about this... Have you heard about this? It's written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky in 1866.

134
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,660
It was the longest one I read, and I- I mean that.

135
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,960
Sometimes this book was very hard to get through, but the parts that

136
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,019
shines in this novel

137
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,429
truly shines. And I do

138
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:44,160
Understand why it's a classic and I want to just focus on the bits that I really really enjoyed which is the bits

139
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,860
revolving around the main character, Raskolnikov.

140
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,279
Raskolnikov is a young man who lives in St. Petersburg. He is, like I said, young,

141
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:01,499
attractive, intelligent and since his father died, his mother and sister had focused on him a lot more

142
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:05,300
which led him to come up with the

143
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,280
Insane idea that he is going to murder and rob an elderly

144
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,060
pawn-broker named Ivanovna. He sees

145
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:21,640
Ivanovna as a lesser human, a bad human, and she has the only thing that Raskolnikov doesn't have which is wealth.

146
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,259
 

147
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,429
Raskolnikov is very poor and he sees it almost as an injustice

148
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:27,569
following

149
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:33,079
Raskolnikov's ideas around why he wants to commit this murder is the bits where I really really enjoyed.

150
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,949
I don't know what it is about following someone's internal thoughts about something

151
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:45,540
that's just bizarre and insane, the truest honest thoughts about someone. And I think that's why I really like Japanese literature as well

152
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,709
nevertheless

153
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:51,959
Raskolnikov doesn't see anything wrong with murdering this woman. He thinks is it's justified and

154
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,970
He almost sees it as a practice of: Can he commit this crime?

155
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,160
Is he able to commit the perfect crime even? And he sort of sneers at other people that it hasn't

156
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,560
been able to commit the perfect crime. So he sneaks into Ivanovna's apartment and he murders her with an axe.

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,240
Unfortunately, Ivanovna's stepsister enters the scene of the crime and

158
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,370
Raskolnikov is forced to murder her as well

159
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,050
Now obviously this wasn't part of the plan and he sort of very clumsily

160
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:27,660
Escapes the the murder scene and he only gets a little bit of gold from the apartment, but still somehow he managed to escape

161
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,459
without anyone

162
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,560
Seeing him commit the crime. He hides all the gold and the murder weapon and

163
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,569
Then we're followed with the second part of the book, The Punishment. We get to follow Raskolnikov's internal struggle

164
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,079
with- through conversations with other people of

165
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,480
why he committed this crime and

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,170
What made him want to actually do it. If he didn't take the gold,

167
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,209
what was the reason- true reason behind it and the guilt with it?

168
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:02,970
The bits I especially enjoyed was the last third of the book. Raskolnikov wants to confess to his love, Sonya,

169
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:11,040
that he committed this murder and he stumble upon his words and he stumbles upon his reasoning that before was so clear to himself

170
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
But when explaining it to someone else he just can't get the right

171
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,560
Reason and words out and I really enjoyed this bit. I don't know. It's just it's so interesting following these thoughts and

172
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,290
The change of Raskolnikov. Eventually, he turns himself in despite the fact that he- there was no real evidence against him.

173
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,819
I think he was just so tired of dealing with this internal struggle and conflict and

174
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:39,139
Even though he doesn't necessarily think that what he did was wrong,

175
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:46,259
he compares his- his murder with what other- what other people have done in the past and

176
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:51,199
Not received any punishment for people doing even worse things than him and getting away with it

177
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,600
So why should he have to feel bad but he turns himself in because of Sonya, the one he loves, and he wants to

178
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,740
serve his punishment and I think the epilogue where they explained this was a bit forced. These

179
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,629
classic novels, they always have the a very strict conclusion to them,

180
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:11,339
at least what I read so far, so maybe that's why the reason why. The reason why Raskolnikov struggled so much

181
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:18,320
Maybe he had found logic behind what he but he put himself above society and that was his demise

182
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,850
What do you think? Have you read it? What what do you think? Personally,

183
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,260
I was extremely bored with the family conflict that was going on throughout this book

184
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:34,180
It didn't interest me at all. But nevertheless, I really enjoyed it. I would love to read more from Dostoevsky in the future

185
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm told that &quot;The Idiot&quot; is even better. Are you still with me? Next up, we have &quot;No Longer Human&quot; with Osamu Dazai

186
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,600
I feel my voice is just different

187
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,839
Talking about this. It's just such a sad story. It follows a story of

188
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,220
Oba and

189
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,490
We follow it through some notebooks that he has left behind. I love Japanese literature. I

190
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,899
Really enjoyed reading Murakami, but I love reading

191
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,580
Yukio Mishima and now Dazai. They so beautifully

192
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,029
describe the internal monologue in it where the protagonist is so extremely self aware of the

193
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,220
Interaction and ideas that they have... I'm explaining this really poorly,

194
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,180
but essentially, the way Japanese culture are so polite, It's hard to understand the true character behind a person and

195
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:34,960
To then read a Japanese novel by- by these authors so- so brilliantly described,

196
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,070
I just feel so immersed into it. Funnily enough, that's exactly- well, there's nothing funny about it, but that's exactly what No Longer

197
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,400
Human is all about. The main character, Oba, can't present

198
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,790
his true self to other people.

199
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,900
He has this facade that

200
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,190
he hides behind

201
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,750
and he makes jokes to other people to hide his true self and he's extremely self aware of this fact

202
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,669
And we don't- we don't get to follow the jokes that he makes other people instead

203
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:10,280
we get to follow his ideas of how he thinks other people perceive his jokes and

204
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,080
It doesn't sound interesting at all. I says I just wanted to give you an idea how it's written, basically.

205
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,240
Something that I've really grown to appreciate over the years is honesty. If I noticed that someone isn't being

206
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,480
really themself or being honest, I

207
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:34,420
always wonder if you're not honest, then who are you? What are you? I don't want to play along with your facade and

208
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,709
Sometimes in this novel,

209
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,819
someone calls out Oba for not being genuine

210
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:43,249
Maybe he laughed in a way that they didn't think was really

211
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,869
Authentic and he recollects on these moments in his life where he did get called out

212
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:53,480
for his facade and he he describes that in such immense pain that

213
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:00,960
Someone is discovering that he isn't actually human. The story of no longer human is an incredibly sad story, especially

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,540
Afterwards finding out about the author himself

215
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,139
Dazai, who shares so much with the main character

216
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:13,939
He was sexually assaulted as a child which is most likely what led to him

217
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,029
protect himself behind this facade. The

218
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,799
double attempt of suicide with his wife where the wife died

219
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,149
but he survived, and the guilt of

220
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:30,019
keep on living, problem with alcoholism and drugs, all these things that the character Oba,

221
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:36,220
Goes through has happened to Dazai at some point in his life as well, the author. At the end of the book

222
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,269
There's a very chilling moment

223
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,619
where

224
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,329
Oba is

225
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:42,769
talking to

226
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:50,269
his friend Hokiki (it's Horiki btw) I think his name was, I don't remember and Hokiki is sort of his character opposite

227
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,619
It's his friend, but almost so sort of his enemy

228
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:55,720
He's very direct and very straightforward

229
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,569
Unlike Oba who hides behind a facade. Hokiki- and whenever Hokiki is involved in his life

230
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:10,100
It sort of triggers these bad behaviors, you know where he turns to alcohol and all these things. In this moment, they're both drinking and

231
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:17,059
they're discussing the &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; funnily, and discussing what the antonym of crime is and

232
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:22,520
Oba sort of goes off as he usually does in his analytic way of

233
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,580
What it actually is while Hokiki is just sort of

234
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:32,700
not really following and making these really dumb assumptions. Hokiki then leaves the room and

235
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,720
Commits adultery with Oba's wife

236
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,340
Oba doesn't do anything to interfere with this and it's at this moment

237
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,710
when you read the novel it's because

238
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,710
he's no longer human and

239
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,190
this happened to Dazai as well and

240
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,190
It's clearly a very personal tale

241
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,680
Reading it at almost in retrospect, it almost feels like a goodbye and

242
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,640
The same year 1948 Dazai's novel came out. Dasai, you know, he had multiple suicide attempts

243
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,350
Finally he succeeded

244
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:14,450
To commit suicide by drowning himself in the river and his body was found on the day of his 49th birthday

245
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,010
I feel like I didn't do it justice by reading this book first

246
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:24,290
this is clearly the final chapter and I want to try and be more careful in the future when I

247
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,230
I pick a new author to make sure that I read

248
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,030
Read in the right order. I absolutely loved reading

249
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,990
This book. Dazai clearly is a phenomenal writer and this is everything I would want from a novel. Next up,

250
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:45,070
I read Yukio Mishima's &quot;Sun and Steel.&quot; I'm not gonna discuss this book because I'm think- I want to save you Mishima for another time

251
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:51,610
I just want to give a quick thanks to blue D on Twitter for sending me their copy of the book

252
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,270
I couldn't find one before I left to Japan and I really really wanted to read it

253
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:04,220
It was funny. I- I walked around with a book. Long story short, I needed to put a paper in something without crinkling it and

254
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,680
So I was using the book because it's very big. It's already becoming too long

255
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:16,220
A lot of other people saw me holding this book in Japan and they were all, &quot;Oh! Yuki Mi- Yukio Mishima!&quot;

256
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:23,860
I don't know if it's- I get I didn't realize how popular it was. I wonder who looks up to Yukio

257
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,270
Mishima in Japan.

258
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,940
Super fascinated by Mishima, but we'll save that for another time. Next up for next week,

259
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,250
We're going to read &quot;Inferno&quot; by August Strindberg. I want to read as-

260
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,450
&quot;Spring Snow,&quot; I think it's called, by Yukio Mishima and

261
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,330
&quot;Runaway Horses&quot; by Yukio Mishima

262
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,910
I'm gonna be a little bit selfish and just read books that I genuinely just want to read

263
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm sorry, but other than that, I just want to say thanks for all the support on the book review.

264
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,740
It's been fantastic. I always doubt myself if it's really worth it or not

265
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,890
To make these but all the positive support and all the comments has been great. So, thank you very much

266
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,429
That's it for me for now. I'll see you by the end of the month

267
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,390
With another book review you can read all of them or none of them

268
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,000
But I'll see you then. Goodbye.
