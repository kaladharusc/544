*clap clap clap clap clap clap*  YES! (yay!)

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,560
I was hoping you would make another Tik Tok video!

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,160
I know. You're welcome.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,040
This is why I am-

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,640
*pauses*

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,420
Losing against T-series. THEH!

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,020
Listen up kid! Tik Tok is spending ads on television. (OH HELLL-)

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,800
Okay?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,380
I'm getting that (brain or braid. IDK, I got hearing problems!) . Papa needs that brain(braid?)

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,420
(The more you know!)

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,620
*rethinks wtf he just said*

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,600
What is he holding? (a microphone!)

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,380
Is that a- OH. It's a microphone. Hehahahaha!

18
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,320

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,980
(IDK!)

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,020
Ya know, when is this meme going to die? (never! the power of being Trancer will never die!)

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,760
NEVER!

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:12,820
This girl will just be bullied until infinity.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
You gotta appreciate it!

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,440
It's like everybody wanted Vine(rip :&lt;) to come back.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,520
Ehhhe, here it is! (ew, no)

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,420
This is it!

27

I'm starting to-ya know. I'm okay with it. (i'm not!)

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,860
You know what! I'm okay with it! You know what?

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,160
I like Tik Tok. Screw you haters! (haha!)

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,700
Why do I have the green screen if I can't even key out my sweater? (ion know!)

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,960
*trys to fix green screen*

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,620
(ugh, this again!)

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,980

*hic*

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,380
This is how real gamers play. (you hear that you false gamer boys and gorls! ya doing it wrong!)

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,240
Just..massage your friends scalp.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,000
That's how you unlock a tactical nuke! (TATICAL NUKE!)

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,040
(oo The Office theme song! with a twist! hueheu!)

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
That's pretty go-*breathes in*

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,120
AHHH!

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,600
That's a forbidden song!

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:14,320
*oml tf is this!*

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Hehahahaha!

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
*hic*

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
So good! (ikr)

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,420
It's like-it's like vine with bullying!

47
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,980
It can't get better better than this. (it can!)

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,920
I-I-I don't think so.

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Okay, this meme can just stop, okay. (finally!)

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,740
Just stop the Winston meme. It's-we done it now.

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,180
We done the Tracer. We done the Winston and we nerfed the Baston!  (pew pew!)

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,100
Now, stop it!

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:44,740
*reads* &quot;You're pretty.&quot;

54
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,640
Pretty gaaay!

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:57,500
You know, you think Tik Tok memes are gonna peek but they just keep going stronger. (istg!)

56
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,520
*shooketh!*

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,580
OH! OH!

58
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,520
Daaamn! How did he do that? Can we get a replay on that one, Brad?

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,660
He's the chosen one!

60
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,140
I love the dead face as well. KEHEHE.

61
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,880
You know something is wrong when people stacking cups are bullying you. (it's very wrong! owo)

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,860
*laughs*

63
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,360
Welcome to 2018. (thanks, but i'm ready to die)

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,280
Where the bullied bullies you.

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,300
*breathes in* I love it!

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,680
It's fantastic!

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,360
*reads*

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,200
*reads then laughs* (as you can see, i'm getting very lazy with the subs!)

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,420
UGGGHHH!

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,080
Think about that. For all of you that failed No Nut November. (i'm a girl..TRIGGERED!)

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,880
Think about the people with no arms.

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:53,100
How do you think they feel? (loaded! HAHAHHA, ok sorry.)

73
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,960
PFFT. Got....DAMMIT!

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,880
It's not a 'You Laugh, You Lose'!

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,120
Look! I'm still in the game. *chuckles*

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,180
They're so dumb!

77
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,480
I kinda like it though. (oh, do you now? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,420
You know, cuz Youtube has always been overflowed with these stoopid uh, vines that make me want to die.

79
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,340
Or vines thats makes me wanna go to the dentist. (why the fuuuc-)

80
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,060
Or vines that makes me wanna finger my(NOPE)

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,900
Just to see if it smells bad down there. (oh!)

82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,880
But now, we finally just have Tik Tok videos again.

83
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,840
And all you have to do is just replace the music and you got yourself a (CPM?) like the apocalypse never happened baby!

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,640
Because..I guess I don't care! (same)

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:38,740
Ooahahah.

86
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,100
I don't know why Minecraft Girlfriends, out of all breeds, have to be the thotty-ist of them all.

87
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,360
You think you meet someone that truly matters. You think-You think you meet someone that you can finally settle down with.

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Never fool for a Minecraft Girlfriend! (very desperate! but hey!)

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,380
They'll break your got damn heart. (owie)

90
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,420
Actually, they'll break your house like a Creeper in the dark.

91
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,180
Alright I-I take back pretty much everything positive I've said about Tik Tok. *laughs*

92
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,960
Jesus Christ. (please help these childrens!)

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
This is what kids are doing these days. (every single fuu-!)

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,240
You know what? (what?) I-I got an idea! (oh wewwy?)

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,620
Gonna stick a phone in my uh mouth. Print a dozen papers of hand emojis.

96
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:34,420
And that'll get me the clout on the internet that I deserve.  *laughs*

97
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,040
*rethinks life again* I don't know- I dont't know what I was expecting.

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,960
This is uh- that's the footage of me uploading a video to Youtube. Hahahahhaha.

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,900
Let's get this bread. Hahahahha.

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,260
I don't know why I have the green screen. I can't- Like What is this? Why is it reflecting on me?

101
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,700
What is happening? (idk, but do something!)

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I'm disappearing guys. (oh no!)

103
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,500
Oh what. No. *becomes sad* You know what? (can't hear what he said) is going to complain. So. (oo sassy)

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:07,380
It's too late. I might as well comment.

105
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
HNN-

106
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,180
Oh my god. They're so dumb!

107
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,840
That it's just-it's just the perfect humor. It's just- I can-*chuckles*

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,340
It's the (wha?) for you-for you dumb balls! (rude much!)

109
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay! I only laugh at smart stuff! (SURE YOU DO!)

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,940
What is this?

111
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,760
Oh my god! (he's so hot!)

112
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,700
*rethinks life for the 3rd time*

113
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,200
(y'all, i've been typing these subs for like an hour)

114
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,540
I wish.

115
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,580
I wish that was my dad.

116
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,720
Oh my god. These.

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,700
OH!

118
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,000
OH!

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,960
OH!

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,720
OH! (ok, got damn!)

121
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
OHHA!

122
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,920
OHAH MY! *laughs*

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,220
Aye, aye. Oh, it's ROBLOX. *laughs*

124
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,140
*hic*

125
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,360
Okay, that one was good.

126
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,880
Well played.

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
*claps*

128
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,300
I almost got angry there for a second.

129
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,760
How could I be so..easily suade?

130
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:27,020
&quot;Grand Theft Auto Roblox&quot; is one of my favorite games. (very fun to play!)

131
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,800
Jesus Christ.

132
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,820
Weebs go to Pluto to get killed by Naruto. (not if Sasuke is there to protect us! or Kakashi!)

133
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,660
That *hits desk* is deep.

134
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,280
Like this video if this left a profound impact on your life. (likes video)

135
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,140
OHMYGOD! STOOPPP! *laughs*

136
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,240
*hic*

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,080
*hic*

138
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm actually terrfied. What in the world?

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,620
Is it Google maps? Oh my god! Jesus!

140
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:11,080
I wanna know where that is. Is that real? (yes ofc!)

141
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,340
This is what I'm talking about!

142
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,380
The Tik Tok bread. (yummy!)

143
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,680
Everyone gets it!

144
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,780
Come on! Alright, it's not that great. But, it's kinda laugh worthy at least.

145
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,300
It's chuckle worthy at least.

146
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,180
It's kinda like my videos. (very cringe worth-JK! i luv ur vids)

147
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,360
You know, there's no redeemable quality. Their really not that funny.

148
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,180
But, uh, people seem to watch it anyway!

149
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,060
That's it! We found it. It's a perfect match!

150
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,820
Outdated memes? Hmm? *chuckles*

151
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,980
Need I say more? I don't think so. (oo sassy!)

152
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:55,880
PFFTTFTFFFTF!

153
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,660
WHY AM I LAUGHING AT THIS? (bcuz it's funny!)

154
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,220
Come on! It can't- I don't know why I have to keep make a case every single one of them.

155
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,560
Like, okay yeah! That was *laughs*

156
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Jesus, stoop!
