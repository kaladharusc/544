[Music]

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:14,490
hey we just got back from rampage where

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,260
we saw we saw two movies this week you

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,360
know we just we just saw a quiet place

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,130
and we got together you know and we saw

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,580
rampage I wanted to see it it was you

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,400
know it's video game movie and I like

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,859
video games and yes we're working on the

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,030
other stuff you know we're gonna you

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,629
Kooza and what is it or god of war is

11
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,120
coming up probably gonna have to skip

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,899
far cry but anyways so I wanted to see

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,899
this because I'm a fan of no yes I

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,940
actually am a fan of bad monster movies

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,920
and I'm a fan of uh you know the rock

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,980
Dwayne Johnson he's a charismatic dude

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,879
next sort of action star I guess after

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,640
Autosports and Egger and yeah so this

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,550
one it has no right to exist it's a moot

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,450
I have no idea how it got made rampage

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,570
of all the video game licenses this is

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,640
the one you're gonna give me I mean to

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,929
go over the top

24
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:18,360
I want a Neill Blomkamp sort of halo I I

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,380
wanted any any Mass Effect you could

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,319
pick any video game license and screw it

27
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,410
up and and you know come up with

28
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,720
something maybe as far as a premise a

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,670
little bit better than this so what's

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,470
the plot in this film there is no plot

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,289
abysm know what is the plot of the film

32
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,479
it's an evil corporation that is it's

33
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,280
like it's run by pretty much cartoon

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,360
villains oh yeah so bad boris and

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,640
Natasha instead of moose and squirrel

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,009
they are genetically engineering rat

37
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,130
monsters in space in space and the space

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,739
station explodes and that's how they

39
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,600
caught sort of dispersed yeah we get

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,330
remaining of all gets all gets really in

41
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,580
the u.s. yes that's just convenient that

42
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,450
it hits but okay so I buy that and that

43
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,520
you've got these not worse it's not the

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
worst yeah I'll call it I'll let it go

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,860
and so eventually they get

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,930
over-aggressive and they come up with

47
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,410
perhaps the stupidest plan in in movie

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,720
history maybe not quite as stupid as uh

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,260
what is it Kingsman to but it's pretty

50
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,900
stupid they they they basically attract

51
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,880
the monsters to the city so we can have

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,239
our movie okay that's the plot and I

53
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,430
think I actually have a different

54
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,520
opinion thank you guys because I think

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,170
this movie was better than any write it

56
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,650
better than better than better than what

57
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,530
I thought it was going to be a movie

58
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,930
based on rampage we're literally all you

59
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,330
have is you have a wolf you know I'm

60
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,080
fucking Godzilla ripoff of the monkey

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,250
destroying the city an8 right and and I

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,739
guess this is about as best as you can

63
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,930
do that premise know if you think about

64
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,820
it this honey

65
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,950
yeah this movie was so easy to have a

66
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,459
slam-dunk if they had it so it's so dumb

67
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,160
and we all know it yeah but so if we

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,390
were talking about this beforehand if

69
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,940
this was a stupid monster movie that new

70
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,500
was a super monster stupid monster movie

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,690
and we got action and fun that I would

72
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,650
have enjoyed it thoroughly

73
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,070
this drug scene and this movie forgot to

74
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,030
there was the stronghold building it was

75
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,350
military shooting alright that's the

76
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,900
whole thing yes you know this movie's

77
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,519
gonna be over-the-top why not make it

78
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,620
that way yeah I've done with it I wanted

79
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,420
it to be kind of close to the video game

80
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,000
it was like alright are actually humans

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,489
most likely die whenever you play again

82
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,620
you die you turn inhuman maybe this

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,540
company whatever they were doing like

84
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,130
some kind of illegal research or

85
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,840
something like that they start like

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,830
messy with some convicts and then

87
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,160
these massive they could become a

88
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,920
monster okay so you you guys did feel

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,270
there wasn't enough action what about

90
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,620
this comparison it's almost like

91
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,820
Godzilla

92
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,709
you know the gods the American Godzilla

93
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,359
where they kind of didn't do any of the

94
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,890
battles and they were focusing on the

95
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,620
human characters and it was like oh come

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,020
on let me see yeah and and so you do get

97
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,060
the payoff at the end and I think it was

98
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,460
a pretty satisfactory payoff now you

99
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,320
could have had a lot more action scenes

100
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,590
in them well they do have a plane being

101
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,080
destroyed so so Dwayne Johnson pulls his

102
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,350
best Tom Cruise impression so I got a

103
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,290
hardcore flashback to the mummy

104
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,500
but in hardcore flashbacks of Godzilla

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,880
these guys are right in the sense that

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,450
the film really sort of lays into its

107
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,430
human characters and unfortunately

108
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,120
outside of the rock and Dwayne Johnson

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,700
you you're like you don't care I mean

110
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,210
Joel were don't DiMaggio isn't revenge

111
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,120
oh man shit gotta go yeah Dodie Reiji or

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,870
imagine like mm baseball this is Magic

113
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,330
Mike yeah so he's in it for like 5

114
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,270
seconds and then Yosemite Sam was in

115
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,340
this film it was like as the the wild

116
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,860
and wacky government agent that is like

117
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,200
terminally Texan yeah he pulls her he

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,820
tries to do a southern accent and you're

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,300
just having fun it's awful it's acting

120
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,870
as as his southern accent is awful but I

121
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,760
think he was just having fun with his

122
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,690
role in kind of a crap movie what's his

123
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,400
name it's a shoe not just more Jesse

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,830
Morgan I've never heard of that guy but

125
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,010
here's the thing is that I thought it

126
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,660
was better than what I thought was going

127
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,890
to be because I like the rock and if I

128
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,780
would much rather be watching the rock

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,690
and his charisma and him do things

130
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,260
rather than the Godzilla

131
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,690
character where you've got to fucking

132
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,210
you know Quicksilver and and you know

133
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,130
Scarlet Witch trying to run the whole

134
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,190
movie this one III I thought it was a

135
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,260
brisk pace and I thought that the tone

136
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,360
that the pacing was all right now the

137
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,990
dialogue I agree is awful the unchanged

138
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,090
so severe it was like thanks her neck

139
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,440
because there's sad scene

140
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,020
if you bet because you have like they

141
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,100
there's all of these innocent animals

142
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,510
killed and you do feel bad and they're

143
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,860
trying to make you feel bad about it and

144
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,090
then all these people dying they try to

145
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,410
make you feel bad but then their

146
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,970
equipment about something that's not all

147
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,500
that funny and then your sanity Sam

148
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,210
comes out and he's like rubbing his

149
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,520
oversized Texas belt buckle and making

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,590
up southern sayings like that slippery

151
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,960
than a wet raccoon in a tornado storms

152
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,030
animals have to stick together what are

153
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,680
you talking about and then it got

154
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,940
serious and then they try to be funny

155
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,560
and everyone's still dying but they're

156
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,940
trying to be funny again yeah and then

157
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,500
it said and it just did I think there

158
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,000
was something like four riders and you

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
can really tell it that L there is a

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,640
moment where they revealed the alligator

161
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,270
and and the camera zooms in on the rock

162
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,010
and and the I'm like all right and we go

163
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,700
one-liner

164
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,100
it's like the worst one-liner ever ever

165
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,560
heard it was like well this sucks yeah

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,190
and I was like yeah okay yes you did

167
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,950
kind of just know that much but

168
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,780
maternity sucked his than he wasted that

169
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,210
or the writers wasted that so yeah it

170
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,100
said the tone is there is all messed up

171
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,140
but I did the best parts of this film

172
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,170
are Dwayne Johnson and the monkey George

173
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,740
hey babe babe babe George because the

174
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,080
the CGI I thought was pretty well as

175
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,130
excellent very realistic up to par with

176
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,900
Planet of the Apes we're trying to

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,720
conserve money here's a guy let's make

178
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,790
the amazing CJ at the end because we

179
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,440
can't afford to do this throughout the

180
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,220
whole film yeah that's yeah so you want

181
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,750
to see more City more destruction more

182
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,770
rampage in the entire film they really

183
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,390
only deal with one building and but

184
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,400
they're much smaller dough compared to

185
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,740
say Godzilla and kaiju

186
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,600
causing a lot of destruction yeah me

187
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,790
yeah and the destruction was good but

188
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,040
yes unfortunately it's only at the end

189
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,200
so what do you guys agree with me on the

190
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,640
character surrounding the supporting

191
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,170
character I don't care about the

192
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,990
non-existent I thought the general did a

193
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,000
good job he's a fucking asshole general

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,010
and and I was like yeah believe him he's

195
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,320
he's really good at his job except for

196
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,940
the fact that he ignores everybody and

197
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:49,640
he's job okay yeah bring it up okay this

198
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,390
this fear we have I appreciate it they

199
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,830
didn't really make her into a love

200
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,490
interest

201
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,420
they made a joke out of it at the end

202
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,040
this a film is gonna appeal to you if

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,780
you're younger I guarantee because the

204
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,700
the kid in me was laughing at all the

205
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,140
jokes so the monkeys just flipping

206
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,110
people off and okay for the love of God

207
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,470
okay so hey people oppening lame

208
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,000
well since I'm no longer eight the

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,100
sophomoric jokes yeah so I was like why

210
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,170
the tone is really interesting in this

211
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,640
movie but I thought like man is

212
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,590
hilarious well immediately bored the

213
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,300
firt the scene just before he's just

214
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,910
like there you go yeah it shows like

215
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,830
people they're dying in buildings and

216
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,210
like our turning children to their

217
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,730
mothers like what is this yeah that was

218
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,940
like wait what I was talking about other

219
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,500
moments where he's just you know

220
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,870
interacting with the ape and they have a

221
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,730
phrase great and you can tell the

222
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,800
friendship and and the friendship feels

223
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,110
real and it feels genuine and it's a CGI

224
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,060
character so then it's probably the most

225
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,270
well done aspect of it but overall I

226
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,860
think you can kind of see how we feel

227
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,470
about the film I think it's a film not

228
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,570
for critics it's a film for people that

229
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,780
it's just a popcorn later because there

230
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,700
are better not even bad for them all

231
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,170
right you know what final verdicts we're

232
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,030
gonna start with Alex all right so this

233
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,970
is a completely and totally average

234
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,220
monster movie but because they had it

235
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,840
was such an

236
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,940
easy thing that to do where if they had

237
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,810
more carnage more fun more rampage they

238
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,820
get a minus one for difficulty so it

239
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,610
gets dropped to a four all righty okay

240
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,460
Jose shaking his head yes I'm totally

241
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,670
gonna agree with that every drop carnage

242
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,640
the plot was terrible I knew something I

243
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,410
knew yeah we knew what we were getting

244
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,520
into right

245
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,100
I wanted a monster true to and then just

246
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
right the plot is paper-thin and and but

247
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,080
in my opinion and it's different from

248
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,140
these guys is probably about as best as

249
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,080
you can make this print no I agree with

250
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,720
you then you just blow it out yeah so

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,630
nevermind I'm lowering my rating as well

252
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,160
because these guys do make some great

253
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,130
points however I did have a lot of fun

254
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,260
in that final act I thought that final

255
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,140
act really did satisfied with the

256
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,490
carnage and and the CGI was great and

257
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,410
there was destruction was good and there

258
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,390
was tension and I did like the

259
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,120
relationship between George and Davis

260
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,110
which is Dwayne Johnson's character so I

261
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,180
think it's gonna be able to edge out a

262
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,520
six out of ten from me

263
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,650
like I said there's probably much better

264
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,050
movies to go to right now a quiet place

265
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,310
is one of them even Jumanji you should

266
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,230
see Jumanji over this though I think

267
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,600
it's out of theaters by now but yeah

268
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,670
save your money and and wait for this to

269
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,150
hit Netflix it's definitely satisfactory

270
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,940
you know to watch when you're bored like

271
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,790
joe said yeah so alright guys that's it

272
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,020
for this one if you want to stick around

273
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,840
for a very short spoiler section do so

274
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,730
and thank you for watching see you on

275

276
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,980
[Applause]

277
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,050
hey guys this is the spoiler section

278
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,180
from Ram homes how are we gonna like we

279
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,400
spoiled this movie already ok question

280
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
did I miss whenever they gave the

281
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,840
antidote to Jorge yeah they should they

282
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,060
threw it in the woman's purse and then

283
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,670
they forced Jorge to eat her in the he's

284
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,320
refugee I have ever psyche that was

285
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,460
bullshit but then I think that was the

286
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,530
only reason they just wanted you to be

287
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,360
satisfied with her death and I was like

288
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,540
yes he died but it was so awkward and

289
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,520
that was the first time George did

290
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,780
anything like there was a first year

291
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,300
really but all anybody directly eats

292
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,380
somebody if they alright nice yeah look

293
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,630
but they set that up okay so you liked

294
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,980
it because it was a payoff like the

295
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,840
videogame but I I felt like they should

296
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,340
have set it up first because it's super

297
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,100
awkward and that's George if it was like

298
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,770
the dog or the alligator or something

299
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,300
would have been cool they kept showing

300
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,920
this fucking rat this whole time

301
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,180
the villains are carrying around this

302
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,950
rad and trying to save this rat and I

303
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,720
thought maybe at the end we'd get this

304
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,280
thing like the rat would would be

305
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,050
mutated or something like that but I was

306
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,120
like nah and then I thought it was maybe

307
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,100
his pen he was like I hate this thing at

308
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,710
the end it was her she was beating in a

309
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,590
bunch during the movie it was so awful

310
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,450
the bad guys in his favorite cartoons

311
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,430
there were cartoons in this movie yeah

312
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,920
it was worse than Marvel villains it was

313
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,690
just it was Follette their whole plan

314
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,280
was to first get this research to I

315
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,790
guess

316
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,340
sell and make a mint on but the space

317
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,220
station blows up scatters conveniently

318
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,130
next to them so then they decide to

319
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,520
modify their antenna on top of their big

320
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,680
evil building which I guess they have

321
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,270
the technology to do that and it

322
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,150
attracts all three of the mega monsters

323
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,790
to them and there was that's a good plan

324
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,670
how you could die this is the building

325
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,830
you're in you can't control these things

326
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,200
they're a near indestructible

327
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,730
well they have the antidote but is you

328
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,560
if you notice they had no delivery

329
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,150
system well also didn't work they

330
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,770
specifically said this antidote doesn't

331
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,990
make them small it just makes them less

332
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,899
that's it yeah so an analogy is just

333
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,459
still gonna be agretti somewhat

334
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,140
aggressive is the same thing with a wolf

335
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,480
like the only reason why George was in a

336
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,459
dick when when he got the antidote after

337
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,470
swallowing the woman is because he had

338
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,120
the friendship and Davis and he could

339
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,399
communicate via sign language so it's

340
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,290
literally the stupidest flaw I've ever

341
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,940
heard of and there was no way they were

342
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,700
gonna get away with it and and at one

343
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,950
point they let the one guy go the the

344
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,020
agent looked at the cowboy age and looks

345
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,330
out the door and he sees just chaos so

346
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,500
he just lets him go and then a big

347
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,720
building to fuck is on it it's like

348
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,160
really the perfect timing for that but

349
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,250
it wasn't that sloppy this movie is such

350
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,430
a lock and that's why I liked it in the

351
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,649
sense that it got a six out of ten

352
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,570
slightly above average and I forgot to

353
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,490
really emphasize that in the review that

354
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,220
it's big and dumb and it's schlocky and

355
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,770
I think it knows that that's why it goes

356
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,110
back and forth between the tones but I

357
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,790
do agree with these guys that would have

358
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,820
overall been stronger if they chose the

359
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,430
tone of we know this shit is stupid and

360
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,170
dumb let's just have fun with it let's

361
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,850
have fun with it they kept going back

362
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,890
and forth between trying to make it a

363
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,740
serious you know move monster movie

364
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,529
don't make it serious and a silly video

365
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,300
game movie the only video game reference

366
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,850
they had is the villains had a arcade a

367
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,500
rampage arcade in the backgrounds like

368
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Jill look at the arcade Joe was like

369
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,170
yeah that's about it

370
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,450
oh oh and the eating of the lady that's

371
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,230
pretty much it yeah so anything else no

372
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,089
I like how it's amazing yeah they they

373
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,010
wrote themselves into a corner they

374
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,350
would just come up with oh no no no we

375
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,600
we made sure that the DNA had special

376
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,089
bat DNA in it so that they would attract

377
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,770
all monsters oh no no don't worry

378
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,690
everyone has warthog DNA's to make sure

379
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,890
that there's horns everywhere with

380
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,140
everyone oh no we can't attack flying

381
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,480
things so let's throw spines at it which

382
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,740
I thought was pretty cool I like the

383
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,140
additional DNA but I agree with you that

384
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,029
and I've noticed a lot of people give

385
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,850
criticism to a lot of female characters

386
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,580
for being Mary Sue's like

387
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,290
ray and some of these other you know

388
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,480
female characters but if you look in

389
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,240
this character like Dwayne is a what do

390
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,740
you what is the equivalent of a very

391
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,740
soon as a guy I forget what mister Mary

392
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,680
Sue miss he's good at every a John Doe

393
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,670
he's good at if I could fly helicopter

394
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,650
the standard oh you're you're yeah you

395
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,240
you are a zoologist

396
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,850
and an ape specialist and Toronto

397
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,570
Special Forces anti poacher madman what

398
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,240
is it UN my United Nations escort and

399
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,470
redacted redacted redacted and you're

400
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,959
like oh my god and all the women love

401
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,430
and all that and he's like oh my god I

402
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,800
wish in his little a doctor friend at

403
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,540
the beginning he was like god I wish I

404
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,459
was him and then the women are like oh

405
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,540
my god he was work out and you know it's

406
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,089
like and this is a duo the director and

407
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,930
Johnson have worked together I think

408
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,980
this is their third time working

409
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,500
together so you know he gets see you

410
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
stupid Iron Man put you he he wants it

411
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,230
in there I know II think so I think it

412
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,700
probably a man-crush on it was like I I

413
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,930
do think that he he likes a little bit

414
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,610
of that but he's a good guy so fuckin

415
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,920
yeah you've got I'm glad I like I like

416
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
Dwayne and I hope he continues to do

417
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,450
maybe a little bit better movies than

418
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,030
this didn't this this do it was

419
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,890
responsible for San Andreas that

420
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,990
horrible yeah they made last yes so I

421
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,940
actually wanted to talk about that and I

422
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,870
don't wanted to talk about another

423
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,520
review but I think this is better than

424
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
San Andreas at least for me because I

425
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,370
got more satisfaction out of the

426
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,290
monsters in the military shooting them

427
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,200
than I did just a random you know some

428
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,820

that's what he had with George how did

432
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:24,169
you see senator that's dilatory yeah I

433
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,210
mean like Burnett

434
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,489

435
