we're gonna look at the Zen egg ze n H

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,290
Eng the Zen egg is basically a desk

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,330
ornament made of wood it's a little

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,280
wooden egg that you can give a flick and

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,930
it wobble around because it's got a

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,090
weight at the bottom of it there's

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,160
really no other features of course you

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,830

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,420

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,759

00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,610
this kind of mean it's kind of funny but

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,289
kind of kind of mean-spirited but yeah

40
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,119
look at that it's adorable

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,030
that feels good to touch and it has a

42
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,009
pleasant smell that was the classic one

43
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,080
that's so classic alright that wasn't

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,160
too bad I thought was gonna be much

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,660
worse than it ended up being

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,770
now we're gonna read some of the

47
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,510

51
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,250
absolutely right you can get them for

52
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,050
very cheap and they're pretty much the

53
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,069

54
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,680

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,940
dumb idea can only come from a Russian

76 upvotes yeah it'll be super relaxing

60
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,000
when I chuck the egg at my sister's head

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,790
why

62
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,950
technical critiques it really just comes

63
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,950
down to it's a dumb egg you're basically

64
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,200
a snake oil salesman I don't need that

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,060
shit to feel happy like previous

66
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,920
Kickstarter where are they now videos I

67
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,900
decided to purchase the product that

68
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,540
we're gonna look at I didn't feel like

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,579
it would be complete enough if I bought

70
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,370
just one egg so I decided to buy the

71
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,120
special nest bundle the Zen egg of value

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,950
proposition where if you buy more they

73
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,260
become cheaper but not that much cheaper

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,870
the Zen eggs arrived a week after I

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,180
ordered them they came in a nice bag and

76
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,680
within this bag were all these

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,709
individual tubes these tubes were very

78
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,510
nice I must give him credit the

79
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,510
packaging I think was very smart and it

80
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,000
looks nice however there's another part

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,250
of the packaging that wasn't so nice and

82
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,159
that's when you opened the tubes and you

83
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,090
have all of these disgusting shavings I

84
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,209
understand the concept is oh it's a cute

85
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,000
little nest egg it's an egg resting in

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,340
some nest material it's sad because I

87
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,959
can't really give him credit on the

88
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,329
packaging because it should be good

89
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,760
you're selling people a wooden egg it's

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,609
it's the same concept with a pet rock

91
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,459
the pet rock came in dope packaging it

92
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,590
was like a little animal carrier with

93
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,810
what do you know little wooden shavings

94
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,299
at the bottom nest material so it made

95
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,549
you think like you were getting more but

96
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,319
you were being sold a pet fucking Rock

97
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,629
it's same thing with boxed water

98
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,070
that's dope packaging it looks like

99
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,269
you're gonna fucking carton of orange

100
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,849
juice but you're not the packaging is

101
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,310
shit the packaging can suck my micro

102
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,570
dick now with this nice bit of

103
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,400
literature that comes in all the Zen egg

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,720
tubes you have undoubtedly a plethora of

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,870
grammar issues symbolizing tranquility

106
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,349
awarness tranquilization I wouldn't

107
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,479
doubt the spelling of this word however

108
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,880
it's not a word as I continue to unbox

109
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,690
these Zen eggs I became increasingly

110
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,889
frustrated because I wasn't feeling

111
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,860
tranquil so I decided to rock them on my

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,320
desk when rocking them on my desk didn't

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
work I decided to give myself some

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,789
gentle massage but the gentle massage

115
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:59,279
wasn't working I needed to

116
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,399
something pleasant but it didn't have a

117
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,219
pleasant smell just smelled like wood so

118
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,289
I went back to rocking when that new

119
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,209
work I went back to rubbing when the

120
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:14,389
rubbing didn't work I just kept smelling

121
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,279
I wasn't getting any relief it was

122
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:32,369
getting worse in fairness does an egg

123
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,589
it's not a scam you know they don't make

124
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,659
any claims like it'll resurrect your

125
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,749
dead mother it's just a little wooden

126
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:43,529
totem a bit of desk art and I can

127
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,419
understand that you know but I wasn't

128
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,789
satisfied with zen egg is just desk art

129
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,219
I wanted to see how many uses I can get

130
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,439
out of it the first idea I had was to

131
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,049
drill a hole in the top of his egg and

132
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:58,289
create a pen or pencil holder but one

133
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,309
thing that I thought was a bit

134
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,079
suspicious when I was drilling the hole

135
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,299
is that at a certain point the drill

136
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:05,219
just gave way and it was it was almost

137
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,519
as if the egg was hollow on the inside

138
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,469
so I said an egg down and I cracked it

139
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,229
open with a hammer and it was filled

140
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,539
with corn for some reason I had this

141
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,599
perception that the eggs would be solid

142
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,579
wood throughout so if you're getting

143
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,009
this if anything you have a commodity oh

144
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,319
it's like that's a solid chunk of maple

145
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,089
so you can at least turn it over on the

146
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:27,929
wood market

147
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,699
apart from turning into a pencil holder

148
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,989
I really couldn't think of any other

149
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:35,999
uses maybe perhaps you can put it in the

150
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,919
junk drawer and forget about it for a

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,069
couple years you can throw it straight

152
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,039
into a trash can you can maybe take it

153
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,039
with you on a hike late at night

154
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,589
possibly dig a hole maybe put it in the

155
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,449
hole and then cover the hole with more

156
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,639
dirt you can use it for arts and crafts

157
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,509
you can paint it I don't know maybe put

158
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,149
a little bass on it maybe if you get

159
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,309
sick of its dumb little face you can for

160
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,439
bit of alcohol on it maybe light it on

161
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,199
fire then you can put it out with fire

162
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,139
extinguisher that'd be kind of neat that

163
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,550
seems like there's a lot of things you

164
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,869
can do with it now that I'm really

165
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,729
putting my mind to it now that we're

166
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,919
done with the egg we can explore what

167
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,409
Gasper has been up to since creating the

168
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,879
Zen egg it looks like he's been making

169
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,940
Zen egg 2.0 aka Eureka pen

170
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,120
I've learned somewhere that 95% of the

171
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,970
activity of our brain goes on without

172
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,790
our awareness what the hell it's like

173
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,890
the weird love child of Steve Jobs in

174
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,200
Willy Wonka if our mother was

175
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600
emotionally unavailable for us or

176
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,840
ignored our needs we felt lonely and sad

177
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,690
so we adopted the pattern which defined

178
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,380
our perception that love hurts the

179
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,960
person who loves you should be cold and

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,510
rough what the fuck does this have to do

181
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,480
with a fucking pen this is insane

182
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,570
as a child we needed to develop a

183
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,360
pattern of obedience in order to survive

184
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,840
in that environment later we continue on

185
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,630
with that pattern and allow other to

186
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,410
bully us

187
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,630
you're a fucking crack monkey what is

188
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,270
this you're preying on people's fucking

189
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,690
emotions to sell them a pen do you have

190
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,090
deep-seated emotional problems things

191
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,710
that have fucked you up for the rest of

192
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,200
your life do you have money problems all

193
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,010
those problems can be solved with Dee

194
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,720
Eureka pain we want to break

195
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
dysfunctional patterns up and adopt new

196
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,300
ones that helps us create the lives we

197
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,270
actually want buying Pepsi has nothing

198
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,640
to do with world peace or even us peace

199
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,850
nor does buying your stupid magnetic pen

200
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,130
have anything to do with years of

201
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,070
childhood neglect I designed it with the

202
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,980
intention for it to support you in

203
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,530
expanding your awareness with personal

204
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,020
writing

205
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,819
[Music]

206
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:05,589
to track their life you enjoy the sad

207
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,779
thing is this dumbass would probably get

208
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,989
amazing marks at any American University

209
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:12,850
Marketing teachers would love it you can

210
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,619
saw ice donuts come out that was

211
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,459
incredible

212
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,350
psychology teachers would love it oh my

213
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,319
god really you've gotten here you got in

214
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,109
here you touched me deep back there no

215
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,519
he didn't fucking touch anything he's

216
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,720
he's full of shit

217
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,389
I love Eureka moment it's such a

218
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,970
profound moment changed my life the way

219
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,759
I want in expanding your awareness with

220
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,619
personal writing I'm gonna try to break

221
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,239
this down for the average person because

222
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,399
he's using a lot of excessive words as

223
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,949
per usual to describe a very simple

224
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:45,129
concept if you write you can be more

225
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,439
creative that's pretty much all this

226
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:49,359
shit boils down to I expand your

227
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,379
awareness personal writing Eureka

228
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,929
moments cost $70 you ever pay $70 for a

229
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,649
pen no well don't as you're scrolling

230
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,179
through the project you'll notice that

231
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:03,009
pretty much everything is the same as

232
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,409
the Zen egg it just goes through all

233
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,019
these cool product shots of it but as

234
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,600
you go further down you'll notice that

235
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,209
there are these um Vitruvian Man style

236
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,839
sketches a Fibonacci sequence golden

237
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,509
section equals silhouette area

238
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,269
he's even got this really dumb one right

239
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:22,989
here at the top

240
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,829
conical shape of the pen at 0.5 degree

241
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,529
degrees the conical pen has the same

242
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,479
angle as the starting point from our

243
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,249
perspective when encompassing the size

244
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,129
of the Sun no it doesn't are you talking

245
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,350
about the diameter of the pen are you

246
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,699
talking are you saying the diameter of

247
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,189
the pen is the same as the diameter of

248
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,949
the Sun because sure I'll give that to

249
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,619
you what does that do look at all of

250
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,109
these the beauty of mathematics you are

251
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:53,350
out of your fucking gourd my dude the

252
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,389
dimensions of the heights of the Eureka

253
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,029
have been planned in accordance with the

254
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,239
multiplication of the module

255
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:03,009
9-millimeters sum of digits of any

256
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,829
dimension is nine one hundred and eight

257
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,889
millimeter shaft is one plus zero plus

258
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,379
eight that's nine the length of the base

259
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,590
is 45 millimeters four plus five is

260
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,260
Nonnie what's up ese do you love the

261
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,210
beauty of mathematics wanna learn how to

262
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,880
multiply by 9 with 9 times 3 1 2 3 27

263
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,670
it's all just bullshit it doesn't mean

264
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,490
anything say oh that's a neat fact takes

265
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,910
one design course this is a video meme

266
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,010
was what we're doing here I don't know

267
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,750
what's next for Gasper but given the

268
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,660
trend of what he's made so far I'm

269
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,670
willing to bet that the next project is

270
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,060
made of wood chopsticks maybe he'll make

271
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,490
a chopstick holder that balances like

272
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,740
that that that would be my guest if you

273
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,420
have any guesses of what Gasper is gonna

274
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,300
make next put them in the comments that

275
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,430
is going to do it for this episode of

276
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,540
Kickstarter crap where are they now

277
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,870
featuring the Zen egg namaste

278
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,240
homies thank you so much for watching I

279
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,370
appreciate the patience with the new

280
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,650
series as well I know it might have

281
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,260
seemed a bit odd to do Kickstarter crap

282
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,540
why are they now but the logic behind

283
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,370
that of course is it's something

284
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,770
familiar but it is a new series all

285
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,270
right I think that's a pretty smooth

286
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,790
transition into something different I

287
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,680
guess I don't anything more to say other

288
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,520
than stay happy stay healthy treat yo

289
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:48,300
mama with respect

290
00:12:48,300 --> 00:13:01,910
[Music]

291
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,750
I made the zi- warm and sensuous

292
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,000
material that feels good to touch
