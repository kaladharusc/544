85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,100
were gonna shoot or something I don't

86
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,110
know I don't know what I was thinking

87
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,430
let's see if I can do this without

88
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,910
killing you but I'm probably not gonna

89
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,710
know you don't whoa what's up whoa whoa

90

97
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,180
everything about this is just completely

98
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,700
100% wrong okay well anyway pitstop just

99
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,980

to be things do people to see I got

102
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,640
damnit

103
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,870
no wonder I can't keep a hat on in the

104
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,820
game wait where's my hat what god damn

105
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,120
it

106
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
I got a dress myself up a little better

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,570
I'm still in the basic outfit that I've

108
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,860
had since the beginning of the game oh

109
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,020
well I don't know where to do that is

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,570
there a place there like a clothing

111
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,730
place oh wait the tannery that's right

112
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,630
that's why I was getting all this

113
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,090
leather so I go to the tannery okay I'm

114
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,950
gonna go back to the to the base and I'm

115
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,020
gonna go to the tannery and that's where

116
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,159
I need to be it was a gun

117
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,649
wait what is that gun about the special

118
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:54,529
gun what's this all about

119
00:06:54,529 --> 00:07:03,860
Oh ooh that's a nice gun let's say you

120
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,330
look at it see what conditions it's in

121
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,009
of course got covered and shit but I

122
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,179
think it's okay all right yeah

123
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:13,429
I'm okay with that hot damn I got a

124
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,319
better pistol I think it even does but

125
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,149
more like a lot more base damage which

126
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:18,110
is probably gonna be good in the long

127
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,659
run because my pistol has not been

128
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,969
capable of killing nobody no way no how

129
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,610
so long as I get some more damage and I

130
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,959
think it'll be perfectly usable

131
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,029
oh hello wild horse how are you doing

132

Oh squat on that it hurt but at least I

think that'll reset my horse cuz

217
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,350
otherwise the horse would just still be

218
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,029
there if I know I think about that last

219
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,769
door as I left in the desert it was it

220
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,420
didn't teleport back the base until like

221
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,029
way way later so I'm just gonna deal

222
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,610
with that that's gonna be the way and

223
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,240
everything will be hunky-dory until

224
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,330

333
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,059
from

334
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,480
why I've got a market for it they made

335
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,350

346
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,880
place you know the way ya think I know

347
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,450
so what exactly are we done this is the

348
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,670
moonshine we took after blowing up the

349
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,410
braithwaite's - right

350
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,929
I think the good citizens taken the

351
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,790
trouble to return their stolen goods

352
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,160
deserve some roll order don't you and

353

it's time we made

354

past it I know I've seen Forrest Gump up

359
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:42,170

360
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,120
this for us somewhere if we can get in

361
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,470

been making money the chest is filling

507
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:43,859
up again slowly but surely part of me

508
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,479
thinks we just get ourselves good and

509
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:48,239
lost but we still need a lot more money

510
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:52,589

511

00:33:58,649 --> 00:33:59,599
peace offering

515
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,509
that's your definition of fun we almost

516
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:17,220
died and we murdered a lot of people I

517
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,919

518
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,929
drunk sequence is so so what do you

519
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,619

520
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,520
parts Oh

521
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,100
on the one side we have got the gray

522
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,000
family

523
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,790
Scots degenerates drunkards the local

524
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,460
law you couldn't make this stuff up rich

525
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,860
is Croesus and on the other they're

526
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,310
mortal enemies the braithwaite's

527
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,320
moonshiners hypocritical both rollin

528
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,130

Romeo and Juliet so what do you boys

531
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,710
thinking you try to rob them both

532
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,430
you sure why not because we got lawmen

533
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,100
in three different states after us and I

534
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,620
want us to get us in trouble but we need

535
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,750
money now we have the opportunity here

536
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,550
to put ourselves in the middle of

537
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,380
something ain't nobody gonna know we was

538
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,140
here because even without us these fools

539
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,480
are gonna kill each other anyway well

540
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,490

541
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,960

542
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,180

599
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,870
because I want to be able to get all the

600
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,000
upgraded satchel stuff because

601

eventually I'm gonna need to do that I

602
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,800

756
00:47:53,650 --> 00:48:00,119
conjecture so they undercut me still

757
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,359
compared to the guttin castration

758
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,589
defenestration and crucifixion they

759

782
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,930
just shut down the moonshine thing okay

783
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,540
that's a bad water if I get illegally

784
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,030
skinned all those cows it's a weird

785
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,560
thought to just pop into my head but I

786
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,080
just like see all the cows and I like I

787
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,530
know I need skin so maybe I should skin

788
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,270
all those cows I swear I'm gonna have

789
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,980
one of these episodes just be the farm

790
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,450
and in exploring episode maybe the next

791
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,800
one it's literally just gonna be

792
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,060
chitchat and farm and exploring and not

793
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,620
focusing on missions right away even

794
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,850
though missions are gonna happen but I

795
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,640
want to get all these good bag upgrades

796
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,050
like it's something that I really want

797
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,550
it's a big part of the game anyway so

798
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:52,480
might as well do it right I see I marry

799
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:00,700

801
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,910

802
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,320

804
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,520

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,990
don't need it right now I'll save all

806
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,430
the collecting for the next episode

807
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,590
anyway this is the exact same place that

808
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,270
I went in for the moonshine so I don't

809
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,610
know why I will come back here why they

their wake a fake where they're looking

01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:32,120
to purchase three armed men you'd be

1106
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,620
armed if you were about to spend $5,000

1107
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:39,170
we should go in the back way though boy

1108
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,609
too many questions

1109

1110
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,680
guy that has $5,000 because I definitely

1111

investment in some stables down here but

1121
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,990

can sell horses to clay and Clive at

1262
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,420
Clemens home they will pay more than a

1263
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,070
stable for stolen horses but less for

1264
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,620
purchases that make sense what about

1265
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,470
wild horses oh that's gonna be any good

1266
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,450

01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:09,820
oh boy boss that is a lot happening that

1268

1402
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,870
don't know why that still deals with him

1403
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:14,960

01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,950
to believe you about man back to the

1414
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:50,610
Civil War place why are they over here

1415
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:52,020
why would they keep him over here in a

1416
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:55,020
cornfield it's amazing out actually like

1417
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,450
I do recognize when games were like go

1418
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:58,740
back to the same place over and over

1419
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,480
again but this one doesn't make it seem

1420
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,550
like that you are going back to the same

1421
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,960
set pieces in like the first game

1422
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,670
everything is crammed together closer

1423
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,010
than it seems it has this ability to

1424
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:09,330
make everything seem like it's

1425
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:11,190
incredibly far away like the distances

1426
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,170
are just huge and I love that about the

1427
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,580
game but also at the same time it's like

1428
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,830
okay I'm sorry to say that we're all

1429
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:19,530
just in the same area here just circling

1430
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:21,270
around because I mean the area that

1431
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,740
we're in this entire area of this game

1432
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:25,920
no bigger than like a small town and

1433
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,270
