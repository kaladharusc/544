10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,420
Boot camp it is

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,780
Sorry, we're not homosexual

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,320
Are you discriminating?

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,880

Oh ****, oh no, oh no no no don't say that

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,560
That's what a gay person would say

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,120
Alright green, keep crawling

I can see the future

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,900
That's why

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,240
Are we going to win?

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,120

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,060
(Laughing)

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,040
What if we don't?

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
Well it will happen alright, don't worry about it

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,520
Just pick where we're landing

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,880
(Laughing) Ok

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,680
Is that not your style?

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,160
Yeah, no (Laughing)

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,720
That is how you win the game dude

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,380
It's the big brain strat

43
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,140
That's thinking outside the box

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,260
(Laughing)

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,880

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,540
Your going to be like swimming across and get shot down

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,060

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,060
(Laughing)

66
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,820
Alright, what did you get?

I really, really want to know

84
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,820
Just going through a bad Spice Girls reference there, but I guess it's too dated

85
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,100
Could you sing one?

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,560
Other that the, &quot;Tell me what you want, what you really, really want&quot; no

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,100

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,460
(Car beeps)

89
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,640

Are you any good?

92
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,140
Ah, I'd like to think so

93
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,940
I do autocross racing when I'm not wasting my life on the internet

94
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,760

What?

102
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,180
Are you making dirty jokes?

103
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,660
(Laughing)

104
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,180
You catch them fast man

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't like it, alright

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,460
I thought this was a christian server

107
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm going to have to report you then

108

Don't kill him

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,740
He's my christian slave

122
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,920

127
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,620

146
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,880
No, no, no I heard

147
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,580
No that's not what you said, you said a not christian word and I'm playing on a christian server

148
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,200
Can you stop, please?

149
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Ok, I'm sorry

150
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,520
Alright, you're forgiven

151
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,660
I still have to report you though

152
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,200
You're a piece of trash, garbage

153
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,560
You're a ****

154
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,260
You're a...

155
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,700
Bag of balls

156
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
That no one wants

157
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,860
(Laughing)

158
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,180
Oh, that's true

159
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,040
Alpha is too far, c'mon

160
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,580
No, it's not

161
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,180
Yeah, it is

162
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,200
C'mon

163
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,640
Alright, if I don't make it

164
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,200

165
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,140
(Laughing)

166
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,260
For what reason?

167
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,100
For lying, obviously

168
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,960
My Mom works for this game

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm not joking

170
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,040
You got to go around that mountain

171
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Yeah, I'm not sure we can get past the mountain

172

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,060
You can't talk

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,800

190
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,000

196
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,420
It was like I was a dinosaur

197
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,800
Wait, that's a point of controversy, let's not mention those Christian

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,020
(Laughing)

199
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,600

Oh, don't threaten me, I will, yeah

201
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,700
Did you see that carry last game?

202
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,060

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Oh nice

206
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,080
Well you should have stayed, I needed the support

207
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm sorry

208
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,640
I was busy reporting someone

209
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,780
Where should we drop?

210
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,360
Ughh, I don't know

211
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm not good at making choices

212
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,480
C'mon man you can do it

213
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,300
Make a choice, we will, we will go there

214
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,600
No, I want to hear where NordicBlade is going

215
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,580
Bravo

216
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,360
Aw

217
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,200
I swayed his opinion, sorry

218
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,600
It was a, it was a, it was a beautifully touching speak that he gave and it really swayed my opinion

219
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,360
And changed my views

220
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,120
Don't let him influence you, c'mon man

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,920
Be yourself

222
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,740
Hey man, you can pick somewhere else

223
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,260
Let's just go to boot camp

224
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't, no he's trying to sway you again

225
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,940
Don't listen to him

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,860
I, I was thinking like paradise but a lot of people don't like dropping hot spots

227
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,160
Paradise has the worst **** i've ever heard, don't ever give your opinion again

228
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,160
(Laughing)

229
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,060
I'm sorry, I'm just joking

230
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,060
I know, I got you man

231
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,900
Ugh, are you kidding me?

232
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,420
Green, do something green

233
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,000
I am

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,260
Oh, Oh, oh you're not doing anything green

235
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,000
Green come here
