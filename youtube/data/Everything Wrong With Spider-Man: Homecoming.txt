kids go the future Toombs his friend

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,240
would totally say she here but the movie

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,469
decides to play its own version of the

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,849
pronoun game to hide a future twist

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,400
please turn over any and all it no one

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,650
saw that not assholes who made this mess

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,060
again paid to clean it up

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,500
Oh King Woodbine would be excellent at

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,449
cinema since I'd say what that's keeping

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,640
the world's change it's time we changed

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,619
too and like that he's a villain this is

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:29,789
as good a time as any to mention that

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,260
the collective timelines of all the

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,600
films in the MCU is basically okay I

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,430
initially ignored the 35 seconds of to

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,110
Sony company logos at the start of the

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,550
film but if you're going to prologue and

19
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,410
then give me a 35 second Marvel logo

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,510
five minutes into the film and send an

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,980
AK twice New York quaint nearly should

22
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,920
the trip you can't show it to anyone

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,149
then why is happy letting him film this

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,520
at all no what I have to say Peter's

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,440
self Ellen captured video journal is way

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,480
the do over edited almost like it's a

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,979
Marvel film Stark's continued commentary

28
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,360
on Mays attractiveness has now

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,830
officially moved from the creepy column

30
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,479
to the offensive column just a stupid

31
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,310
dangerous thing to do in view of all the

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,780
schools front windows look at all those

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,110
goddamn windows how's your seam ah Jesus

34
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,500
Christ

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,330
dear Kevin Feige get your Marisa Tomei

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,770
boner and check because it's starting to

37
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,509
creep us all out got to admit I'm not a

38
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,100
fan of the stark Spidey suit spider-man

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,390
is cool because he's smart enough to

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,920
build a suit himself I don't need

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,450
another Iron Man thank you very much

42
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,100
okay I'm not made of steel spider-man

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,540
giving directions to an older lady is

44
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,220
exactly what spider-man is all about and

45
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,030
this movie just turned us in off Stan

46
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,560
Lee cameos have become caricatures of

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,040
themselves at this point tooms has been

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,420
selling this alien tech for the past

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,710
eight years and this is the first time

50
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,360
Spidey or anyone else has seen any of it

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,759
fine and then is fighting the Avengers

52
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,040
in the bank on 21st Street this is

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,149
supposed to be funny and play off of

54
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,680
what spider-man has already set but

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,000
clearly this guy I can see from across

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,469
the street those aren't the Avengers so

57
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,170
why tell the cops that yeah the craziest

58
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,729
thing just happened to me happy hasn't

59
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,110
answered Peters calls or responded to

60
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,399
any of his texts for the past however

61
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,140
many weeks but conveniently chooses now

62
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,789
to answer one of his calls in Queens

63
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,319
where every other resident is old with

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,400
nothing to do but spy on their neighbors

65
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,140
nobody sees this isn't

66
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,370
enough to close this door with his hand

67
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,050
does he need to shoot the web other than

68
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,459
to further sell his in the room right

69
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,730
now best friends reaction Peter just

70
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,020
came in from the window directly behind

71
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,970
net how'd he not see him her sense him

72
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,900
this movie leads you to believe

73
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,670
spider-man doesn't have spidey sense or

74
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,260
doesn't have it yet why is that exactly

75
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,090
what is removing that from the mythos of

76
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,580
this character adding Turkey is a

77
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,530
disaster I could have told you that

78
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,890
before you started cooking but whatever

79
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,540
that's for five how many new backpacks

80
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,040
does he need before Aunt May's starts

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,800
asking reasonable questions 10 15 5

82
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,330
clearly doesn't cut it can you spit

83
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,190
fennel can you summon an army of spiders

84
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,959
the series of Ned asking questions to

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,420
Peter is hilarious I'll have to yeah we

86
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,510
met but there is zero chance no one

87
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,830
sitting around Peter and Ned can't hear

88
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,730
what they're saying pretty sure this

89
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,769
guy's a war criminal now but whatever

90
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,600
after so DS videos this guy has a point

91
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,190
also public school in a nutshell

92
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,650
everyone okay another sin off this is

93
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,300
funny and all spider-man in the suburbs

94
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,560
but there are a bunch of trees he could

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,940
be swinging off right behind him in this

96
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,320
shot alone how did these stupid ass

97
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,670
henchmen think they could demo a blue

98
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,230
alien explosion gun without anyone

99
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,060
taking notice and Peter just happens to

100
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,410
be acting and decisive on the roof to

101
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,790
conveniently see it there's me something

102
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,590
this stick owes somebody I'm not trying

103
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,410
to shoot them back in time look it may

104
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,850
be hard to buy a gun in New York but

105
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,440
it's gotta be easier than getting access

106
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,579
to the only dudes that have this

107
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,290
technology right if childish gambino

108
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,150
just wanted to stick somebody up why not

109
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,530
just go with the finger in your pocket

110
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,329
technique movie steals an outtake from

111
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,190

[Music]

113
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,319
somehow Spidey survives this fault even

114
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,550
though later Karen tells him that

115
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,629
falling off the Washington Monument

116
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:48,380
would be lethal

basically the whole problem with civil

124
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,170
war in one sentence if you come across

125
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,330
these weapons again call happy

126
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,709
considering you never answers the phone

127
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,180
when Peter calls I'm not sure how this

128
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,069
is good advice and how the hell did the

129
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,599
cell phone even survive that thousand

130

minutes ago didn't get around from me to

132
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,209
the party how is he getting back home

133
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,190
the shocker I shock people

134
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,080
what is this pull Leslie ah damn even

135
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,130
this movie's main villain would be

136
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,750
excellent at cinemasins and if you can

137
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,190
afford me out there though right

138
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,650
everything I'd know not Tom Hardy is not

139
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,180
too bright to be threatening not Birdman

140
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,639
like this yeah that seems smart also

141
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,900
Peter decides to try and get to the

142
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,190
bottom of the whole purple gun thing

143

mystery during class and somehow doesn't

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,520
get discovered these guys would not be

Spidey homing bacon kind of lame thanks

149

yes but as much as I enjoyed this movie

164
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,690
I must repeat that I am knocked down

165
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,669
with Iron Man Spidey and yes you comic

166

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,090
in the comics I don't care activating

168
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,250
instant kill instant kill

169
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,780
why would Tony even put this setting in

170
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,340
the suit and how does it work exactly

171
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,270
all the sudden his webs become poisonous

172
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,180
possible combinations Jesus

173
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,800
whoops neither do i Peter neither do

174
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,240
want you appear to have a mild

175
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,850
concussion no lie the NFL sued Sony for

176
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,950
this line of dial activating

177
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,940
reconnaissance from spider God spider

178
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,410
God there's literally nothing the suit

179
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,420
can't do for him it's literally not a

180
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,680
spider-man movie unless the girl he

181
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,390
likes ends up in mortal peril literally

182
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,820
this is your chance Peter kisser why in

183
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,770
the ever-loving would Tony Stark write a

184
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,270
suit AI for Peter that gives him a

185
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,980
relationship advice and honestly who

186
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,150
would trust relationship advice from

187
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,740
something written by Tony Stark anyway I

188
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,030
don't see how hang up your mode of

189
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,050
transportation is helpful talk to me

190
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,250
when you're smart enough to suggest this

191
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,750
without being asked stupid suit lady

192
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,750
Karen that's super convenient for Peter

193
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,910
right now also how it doesn't Stark had

194
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,830
access to this footage um that looks

195
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,810
terrible a red and blue paper airplane

196
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,920
would have looked more like a gliding

197
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,250
spider-man than that does hey wait a

198
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,720
second he didn't give any such command

199
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,370
back before casually tossing grenade web

200
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,670
but later he has to say to get that web

201
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,230
site if only there was a large body of

202
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,910
water close by high to throw this in the

203
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,110
spray a bunch of webs and when it

204
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,130
doesn't work use brute strength

205
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,080
sequences way more like the subway scene

206
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,370
in spider-man 2 then I think this

207
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,990
movie's intended Jesus Christ poses

208
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,670
Jesus how the hell did Tony know to

209
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,200
bring these things the ship only split

210
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,270
down the middle like 90 seconds ago does

211
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,620
he just always travel with dozens of

212
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,840
tiny thrust robots everyone okay no

213
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,910
thanks to you there was almost zero

214
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,260
chance no one died in that incident

215
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,540
everyone else said I was crazy to

216
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,490
recruit a fourteen-year-old kid everyone

217
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,230
else was right well this is the fakest

218
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,610
background that ever faked being a

219
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,560
background I guess you already have a

220
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,110
date to homecoming actually I'm so busy

221
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,490
playing and I never really got around to

222
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,370
that part so yeah no that girl has a

223
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,810
date a backup date and three hot

224
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,010
friendzone dudes on standby I know many

225
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,630
of you love this moment and more power

226
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,190
to you but the sheer odds of Peters

227
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,840
nemesis being the dad of his date or

228
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,250
just I mean you could win the lottery

229
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,870
more easily he disappeared like you

230
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,480
always do but you didn't DC to

231
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,830
movie mostly redeems the coincidence dad

232
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,450
thing with the scene where he realizes

233
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,430
who Peter is and which ends with one of

234
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,870
the coolest hero villain conversations

235
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,960
ever I'd kill you and everybody loved

236
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,790
this entire scene have to leave rules

237
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,890
another sin off but also might want to

238
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,360
pull away from the very public place

239
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,590
you're currently in front on before

240
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,230
pulling out that gun gotta go I'm sorry

241
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,000
why does he have to go other than there

242
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,170
wouldn't be a movie if he doesn't the

243
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,460
Saints thing to do here would be to call

244
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,960
happy and let him know you've discovered

245
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,640
the identity of the vulture and he's got

246
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,830
something going down tonight

247
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,030
how did shocker know this was the door

248
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,560
Peter would come out of how the hell did

249
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,820
vulture even have time to call shocker

250
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,560
and get him here to do this Peter went

251
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,540
inside for like 45 seconds shocker must

252
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,470
have been in the trunk of vultures

253
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,970
goddamn car shocker kicks the

254
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,380
web-shooter instead of crushing it or

255
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,160
shocking it I get the spider-man has

256
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,810
insane strength but he doesn't have the

257
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,490
star costume on anymore it's basically

258
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,900
just wearing a hoodie so how has he not

259
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,550
cut up all to hell here and or knocked

260
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,840
unconscious he was knocked unconscious

261
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,400
earlier while in the better suit after

262
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,840
hitting the top of the transport truck I

263
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,220
know when bronzy knows fresh and that

264
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,900
was not fresh this is some weird comic

265
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,250
thing with spider-man and branzino

266
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,990
because in the amazing spider-man the

267
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,340
dialogue makes a point of saying they're

268
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,900
eating branzino at Quinn's house it's

269
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,980
just too fucking weird to be a

270
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,890
coincidence right happy hangs up on Ned

271
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,240
and basically creates the need for this

272
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,890
movie to even have a climax he takes

273
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,480
this call like a normal human being an

274
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,220
Iron Man ends this about three minutes

275
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,430
flat

276
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,290
we just got a load Tony's old Hulk

277
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,540
Buster armor prototype for Cap's new

278
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,970
shield and the making the Magnum floors

279
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,780
magic belt

280
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,970
it's the MacGuffin plane and looking at

281
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,140
porn love Ned why wouldn't Peter just

282
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,550
whip up tombs right now you know how

283
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,050
this wouldn't been an issue if Peter had

284
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,060
webbed up both fucking hands couldn't he

285
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,160
at this point like step forward there's

286
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,270
literally nothing in front of him right

287
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,520
now retro reflective panels engaged

288
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
how did Toombs crew know so much about

289
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,550
this moving table and that the plane

290
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,110
will be cloaked just one scene of them

291
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,610
paying off a guy on the inside is all it

292
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,600
would have taken if they've got these

293
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,950
alien balls why do they even need to

294
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,150
make the weapons and sell them they

295
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,440
could just enter vaults or whatever they

296
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,940
wanted to and steal all the money they

297
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,440
need it may be set for life they went to

298
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,970
this much trouble with security and got

299
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,830
or built a being invisible jet but

300
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,450
didn't put any locking mechanisms on the

301
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,970
actual crates themselves just a demo I'm

302
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,920
going

303
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,189
on the outside of an invisible jet fine

304
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:44,199
if I go first - cute line but she is not

305
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,429
your girlfriend she only went out with

306
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:47,109
you once to a dance were you immediately

307
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:50,619
abandoned her sony made a movie and

308
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,179
Marvel said hey let us edit that fight

309
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,920
scene for you in our signature style and

310
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,809
Sony said no way but Marvel did it

311
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:56,230
anyway

312
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,639
good thing no one was hanging out on

313
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,989
Coney Island on this night the Spider

314
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,489
Man also resistant to fire sometime

315
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:02,049
between the ferry and the plane and now

316
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,669
this he should just be ash at this point

317
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,850
but my friends call me MJ what you movie

318
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,989
I thought you don't have any friends

319
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:12,579
and why do you now exactly you've done

320
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,839
nothing but flip people off and make

321
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,339
mean drawings of them this entire movie

322
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:17,169
so what happened to change all this and

323
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,609
I'll introduce the world

324
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,169
the newest official member of the

325
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,970
Avengers why would Tony go from I need

326
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,230
the suit back - you're part of the

327
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,879
Avengers after one heroic moment for

328
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,269
Peter

329
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,100
he took the suit for Peter going after

330
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,359
