1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:14,340
I'm a South African singing star hey

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,719
everybody welcome back to another

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,150
episode of kick starter crap just

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,130
kidding it's called Kickstarter where

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,949
are they now and it's where I look back

6
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,720
at previously covered Kickstarter

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,119
projects and I asked the question where

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,670
are they now it is going to be a less

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,279
lazy version of the whole reacting to my

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,829
old video shtick I will look at old

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,410
videos see where I went wrong or where I

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,420
went right and then we are going to

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,340
either buy the product if we can buy it

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,520
or we are going to visit the creator if

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,160
it was more a creator centric project I

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,690
think it's good new beginning for a

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,360
whole new era of idubbbz TV content we

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
are moving in a different direction but

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
you know remembering where we came from

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,090
the project that were going to look at

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,190
today is called the coolest cooler it

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,600
was one of the most successful

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,030
Kickstarter projects in history raising

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,420
around 13 million dollars and at the

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,010
time it was sort of a risk for me to

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,170
cover this project because there wasn't

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,299
anything innately wrong with it I think

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,040
the average person would look at it and

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,960
say well that seems like a mighty fine

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,729
cooler now we're gonna watch my video

31
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,610
and see if my criticisms hold up to the

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,869
test of time hello everybody back to

33
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,850
work kickstarter crack in the last video

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,100
i took a look at rocket skates and some

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,990
of you guys said it's not goddamn the

36
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,790
variety of voices that's really

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,590
impressive so why haven't cooler designs

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,500
changed in almost 50 years I don't know

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,780
maybe because there's nothing to change

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,270
it's a fucking cooler you put drinks in

41
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,970
it okay so overall what I'm gathering is

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,979
that I'd seem to not think that it was

43
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,030
important to have all these

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,130
accoutrements attached to your cooler

45
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,899
regular cooler tires are flimsy

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,240
and sink right into the sand we design

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,040
the coolest wheels to be twice as wide

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,110
to roll twice as easily but what's gonna

49
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,000
happen sand is gonna go into the tires

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,700
sand is gonna go into your outlets and

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,390
sand sand sand sand

52
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,520
and fucking I think I heart on the sand

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,319
point a little too much talking a lot

54
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,060
about sand but that's the only time I've

55
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,310
ever brought a cooler anywheres to the

56
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,959
beach I think what the argument boils

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,030
down to is that it's a very high price

58
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,100
tag of $185 for a product that is not

59
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,410
particularly unique in its features by

60
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,270
covering a project like the coolest I

61
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,670
sort of opened myself up to a little bit

62
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,980
dissenting opinion for those cooler

63
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,470
enthusiasts out there who thought I was

64
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,170
sort of reaching that's actually pretty

65
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,080
dope the Beachwood sang fucking this

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,310
will be good at a Bush party or uh or a

67
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,680
camping trip this actually looks really

68
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,440
epic this cooler low-key pretty bomb

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,320
hella useful shit this is honestly the

70
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,890
shittiest

71
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:10,120
I dub series now that we've gotten that

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,410
out of the way we're gonna look at the

73
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,070
timeline what has happened from 2014

74
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,280
till now with the coolest Kickstarter's

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,410
biggest shit show somehow got even

76
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,900
Messier coolest cooler is flat broke and

77
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,000
looking for an investor but backers are

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,040
pissed off coolest cooler needs another

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,680
15 million trader says coolest cooler

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,989
under investigation by Oregon Department

81
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,840
of Justice coolest cooler no longer hot

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,750
as price drops on Amazon to all the

83
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,280
people who backed the coolest on

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
Kickstarter I'm very sorry that it

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,959
turned into such a fucking shit show

86
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,750
between waiting years to receive it

87
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,060
paying an extra ninety seven dollars to

88
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,519
receive it or not receiving it at all it

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,590
really sucks but if you want to seek

90
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,750
comfort by viewing the pain of others

91
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,090
you can always visit the coolest comment

92
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,829
page on their Kickstarter project and

93
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,950
read daily updates from people nauseated

94
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,600
by all the money you are making when you

95
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,150
took my almost 400 pounds and I received

96
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,700
nothing Ryan my financial status has

97
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,070
changed I need cash to pay my bills

98
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,720
please mail me my money back

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
this is how stupid these morons are I've

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,299
emailed them numerous times offering to

101
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,880
pay full price do these coolers even

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,550
exist these coolers actually do exist I

103
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,550
purchased one off of Amazon for $200

104
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,070
roughly the same price that all these

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,730
kind people back here paid but I got

106
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,250
mine straight away via Amazon Prime you

107
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,320
may think that I really don't fit the

108
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,200
demographic of fairly reviewing a cooler

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,090
but what you gotta remember is I'm a

110
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,240
thirty year old white male

111
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:56,810
[Music]

112
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:04,460
[Music]

113
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,700
[Applause]

114
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,800
[Music]

115
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,480
I'll start this review off by saying the

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,430
one nice thing that I can and that is

117
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,880
that it was manufactured quite well now

118
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
that that's out of the way let's address

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,330
all the things that are wrong with it

120
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,670
this thing weighs 40 pounds without

121
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,220
anything inside of it this means if you

122
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,200
want to carry it up and down a set of

123
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,090
stairs or put in the back you pickup

124
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,370
truck you're gonna have to not be anemic

125
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,400
like me the coolest blender this is the

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,020
feature that they're touting all over

127
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,820
the place all the plinth you're gonna

128
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,440
love the blender the blenders great

129
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,290
blend all sorts of stuff aka if you're

130
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,270
an alcoholic you can blend stuff no

131
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,950
average person is gonna bring around a

132
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,960
jug of milk with them to make a nice

133
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,000
delicious strawberry smoothie so this is

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
just your run-of-the-mill blender you

135
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,360
can get one that's the same quality

136
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,650
Walmart for probably eight dollars and

137
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,150
just like any other run-of-the-mill

138
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,820
blender it's gonna have a hard time

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,710
chopping up ice very finely so we didn't

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:15,640
even bring any ice not bad not bad

141
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,920
coolest if there's one thing running

142
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,730
drivers good at it's making a mean

143
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,590
summertime drink the Bluetooth speaker

144
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,020
is just that it's a bluetooth speaker it

145
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,090
really doesn't do anything else I did

146
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,830
put to the test the validity of the

147
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,020
statement it's a waterproof Bluetooth

148
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:42,790
speaker work loud

149
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,170
additionally they had a corkscrew that

150
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,940
went in there just furthering the

151
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,280
concept of this is meant for drinkers

152
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,340
and it serves no purpose it's just

153
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,690
floating around in there there's no

154
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,970
compartment that it goes into you know

155
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,170
with a normal cooler

156
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,460
you couldn't just bring around a

157
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,350
cucumber whenever you fancied it and

158
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,870
chop it up on one of your plates or

159
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,140
cutting board as I'll I like to refer to

160
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,880
it as because that's what it is it's a

161
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,650
cutting board we might want to pull up

162
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,450
the high-speed camera to get a shot of

163
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:17,000
this that's wafer thin this is the

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,030
world's greatest peeler it pits world's

165
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,790
greatest salesman smack a like on this

166
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,050
video if you remember the world's

167
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,330
greatest salesman video YouTube take

168
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,680
your mama's home baked Lay's potato

169
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,340
chips Mac a little macaroni salad if

170
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,260
you're gone a health kicker is this a

171
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,360
good shot of the food there's a meal for

172
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,770
one of the good old boys this is how you

173
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,400
cut a watermelon folks all right so once

174
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,930
you got to cut open most of the way you

175
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,840
just crack it over your knee Wow thank

176
00:07:50,840 --> 00:08:02,330
you having seen this cooler and all of

177
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,430
its functionality and features how much

178
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,830
would you pay for it paying $200 was a

179
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,900
deep discount because what they're

180
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,730
actually retailing this piece of shit

181
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,230
for is $400 and that is even a discount

182
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,230
it's actually $450 the thing I dislike

183
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,510
most about this is the guy ryan grepper

184
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,310
who's responsible for creating the

185
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,590
coolest and promoting it is probably

186
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,850
going to be fine at the end of the day

187
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,890
this was an order from the Amazon launch

188
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,590
pad that is for their inventory they

189
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,720
purchased this inventory the profits

190
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,160
from that purchased have helped

191
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,470
subsidize the cost of manufacturing for

192
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,599
everyone else's coolest this is costing

193
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,150
way more than I predicted well let me

194
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,310
sell a bunch of units to Amazon to pay

195
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,230
for the units that I promised these

196
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,870
people despite all of the incompetencies

197
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,180
that ryan grepper has displayed in his

198
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,430
kickstarter project he has a website

199
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,690
called invent

200
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,260
Blueprint calm it's one of those

201
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,120
bullshit sort of tie Lopez draw your

202
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,980
penis in five short weeks sort of

203
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,020
websites getting to where I am was not

204
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,910
an easy path though I made many

205
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,530
expensive mistakes which if I had known

206
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,320
how to avoid would have saved me tens of

207
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,790
thousands of dollars in countless hours

208
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,070
of effort and he tells you about how you

209
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,230
can start earning passive income and

210
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,270
tells you all about the the secret

211
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,680
method but he didn't tell you about the

212
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,030
secret method and you'll soon discover

213
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,010
why inventors blueprint is your smart

214
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,110
choice to turn your idea into a

215
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,850
profitable product you have to buy the

216
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,400
secret method for five hundred dollars

217
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,610
and then you get his awesome module of

218
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,650
course it's not awesome it's complete

219
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,200
horseshit if you want to learn how to be

220
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,760
an inventor or whatever you're gonna

221
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,590
read a five-dollar book you don't have

222
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,030
to pay five hundred dollars

223
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,820
to unlock modules I'm now enjoying

224
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,650
passive income from royalties and

225
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,840
residual sales and the flexibility and

226
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,640
freedom of my dream lifestyle how about

227
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,410
we talk about active income you know

228
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,910
that income that you have to constantly

229
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,220
fucking work for it seems as though you

230
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,490
just want other people's money to work

231
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,460
for you constantly let's let's slurp up

232
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,320
all the backers money and then when we

233
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,780
can't pay for it let's slurp up the

234
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,150
money from Amazon to then pay for it

235
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,410

249
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,360
