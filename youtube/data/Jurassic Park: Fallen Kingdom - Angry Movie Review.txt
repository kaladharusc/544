asks for and us Americans we get it like

11

them

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,000
this is no point in putting out this

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,890
review because you've already got tons

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,510
of reviews for but we're gonna do it

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,890
anyway god dang it

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,190
because I'm gonna see this thing through

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,519
so what did you guys think of basically

18
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,470
everything you need to know is in the

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,839
title the full ah very clever Joe are

20
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:09,369
you saying they need to stop best one it

21
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:17,830
was amazing this one was great they

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,100
fucked up the song too like this I'm the

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,250
soundtrack in this film is so

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,590
plastically loud and thinks it's so much

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,260
better it's actually outpacing what's

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,180
happening on the screen and overpowering

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,700
certain scene yeah it was noticeable I

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,140
was like what you know that the scene in

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,370
the trailer were the running from the

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,780
dinos and they're hiding behind that

31
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,150
ball that that scene I think you'll

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,440
notice that this composers looks it's

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,560
like relax bro I know you're just coming

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,960
on board with your fake shoes shit I

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,890
know it is real but uh okay so what does

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,290
this film about well we'll try to stay

37
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,210
away from spoilers but you think maybe

38
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,550
it's another Island Adventure it's not

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,740
I'd say maybe about one third of the

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,560
film is probably only I know behalf half

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,630
of the film I think is on the island the

42
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,119
rest of it is going to Center and give

43
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,940
us some more backstory on the creation

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,610
of the dinosaurs the genetics of the

45
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,230
dinosaurs a partnership between

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,819
this partner so you're gonna get that

47
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,890
subplot and goes back and forth between

48
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,129
the island and the this rich guys house

49
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,819
essentially with the new new characters

50
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,739
gosh I don't know how much I can say

51
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,590
without spoiling but we'll try to stay

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,319
away from that so what did you think

53
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,650
about the return of you know they all

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,599
these new character the returning

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,730
characters these characters are fine I

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,079
mean in the between Chris Pratt's

57
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,790
characters not super deep he's just

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,980
awesome I mean Chris Pratt is awesome

59
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,209
but don't you feel like you is less

60
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,030
awesome in this film like he's just kind

61
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,730
of going through the motions well well

62
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,900
there was much they were like

63
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,090
unbelievable scenes where this animal

64
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,489
trainer is running through and he's like

65
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,739
beating people up in this like really

66
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,660
long scene where he just like you know

67
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,400
just some dude and then he punches some

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,000
other dude and they have like a bunch of

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,290
other things I was like alright well

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,269
whatever this is this is his thing other

71
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,890
recurring characters are fine I hated

72
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,190
the new ones like they were just there

73
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,109
was like this folder of like overuse

74
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,569
like stereotypes it's like this lets get

75
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,780
you the annoying coward gun let's get

76
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,599
two grizzled veteran military the

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,209
military dudes who are on the island

78
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,389
it's yeah yes so the film is derivative

79
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:40,160
it's cliched it is it's actually kind of

80
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,700
more a monster of a creature

81
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,669
you know monster film and the Storrow

82
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,230
had had something to do with is he

83
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,810
advice a little bit less yeah well and

84
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,709
here's a day I kind of appreciated some

85
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,419
of the parts where it's just a monster

86
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,879
film if here's the thing I think I like

87
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,709
the film a little bit more than these

88
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,660
two guys because Chuck yes why is it a

89
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,569
shocker Joe you usually do I just like

90
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,209
everything is that what's going on no

91
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,169
come on

92
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,150
so here's what I think when I'm the

93
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,949
point I'm trying to make is whereas I

94
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,289
did not like the last film and I was

95
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,510
rough on it 6 out of 10 people gave me

96
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,310
shit for that when know that film was

97
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,880
not very good it's literal

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,190
repeat of the first film except for not

99
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,040
as good this film at least it tries to

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,870
do something different at least we go

101
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,000
away from the island at least we get to

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,550
see seas this sort of I know we have

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,310
seen it but last world we have seen in

104
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,530
the last world yeah but it's only one

105
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,260
t-rex running around it's not what we

106
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,930
see here okay and we get these subplots

107
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,620
that are stupid this film is so fucking

108
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,350
stupid but it is it goes into the

109
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,840
territory of just wish fulfillment I we

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,090
got these freaking tree huggers here

111
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,430
wanting to save the fucking dinosaurs

112
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,250
when they should just die let them die

113
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,160
on the island God didn't create these

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,020
creatures man created these creatures

115
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,150
and now God's trying to correct your

116
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,370
mistake by blowing up the volcano that

117
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,900
you've seen in the trailer in the whole

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,520
film when should we save the dinosaurs

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,710
okay let's save the dinosaurs but the

120
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,200
team they bring in to save the dinosaurs

121
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,780
ill-equipped stupid just stupid set up

122
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,490
out of fuck that they fit all up in this

123
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,340
tiny ass ship whatever fine and then we

124
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,910
get to see capitalists and men this

125
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,240
whole fucking wheelers know but okay but

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,670
but you will try to stay away from that

127
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,890
stuff but basically you get a little bit

128
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,350
of revenge revenge film up in here

129
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,470
somewhere which which is kind of

130
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,750
enjoyable but they can't even fuck that

131
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,120
like you don't really get a big payoff

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,380
there either so this is uh not good not

133
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,680
good what what I did like is when they

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,910
took something that was really important

135
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,940
to my childhood and then they stepped on

136
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,200
and then there were scenes where they

137
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,570
didn't have any like gravity or weight

138
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,540
or depth but they put some John Williams

139
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,790
like other parts of the theme in there

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,080
and they're trying to go like who

141
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,610
remember you remember there's no they

142
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,550
because they don't watch man is dead and

143
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,100
as soon as I saw these three scenes yeah

144
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,160
tell you about I was like it's over this

145
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,330
is a loss is the magic is gone worst one

146
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,160
in this movie whenever they see the

147
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,770
brontosaurus for the first time it

148
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,680
didn't not have the same charm like it

149
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,940
yeah I'm

150
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,030
iconic scene you ruined it this one did

151
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,400
it the pin that isn't that weird Joe

152
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,470
that CGI was worse and you don't really

153
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,540
believe it as much as on this yellow did

154
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,920
more impact and they say I'm looking

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,750
time ago stampede they're hiding behind

156
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,790
the log I was like the other one did it

157
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,150
better

158
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,790
exacty Rex you see it on the dealer if

159
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,000
he saves a day you see another one they

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,060
don't know no they've waited the whole

161
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,950
dinosaurs come in last minute to say oh

162
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,750
my gosh any time a characters here comes

163
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,250
the fucking dinosaur to save every day

164
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,290
it doesn't matter what that is they're

165
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,060
gonna close fucking state and so it's

166
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,010
like a raptor of fucking deer eggs oh

167
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,140
fuck it doesn't matter the diner is

168
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,550
gonna show you know what if they had set

169
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,650
up the dinosaurs have human brains and

170
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,440
they are characters themselves then yeah

171
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,790
would have made sense but it doesn't

172
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,760
make sense here and in fact in fact what

173
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,980
will pisses me off about this film

174
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,700
it's dinosaurs are like the most ignored

175
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,430
kind of boring part to it or you know

176
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,230
they don't focus if you know anything

177
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,300
for the 90% of its movies it's more

178
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,780
about the fucking tree huggers and the

179
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,730
capitalists and the fuckin rich people

180
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,710
and fun focus on everything you don't

181
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,530
want right and and then we get to the

182
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,260
high bridge we get another hybrid we've

183
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,200
not just using spoilers I can't help it

184
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,919
I can't help it it's a there was no

185
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
reason for this thing to exist because

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,669
like you said it's as taking everything

187
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,800
is taking every cliche in the book it's

188
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,930
mixing it they got a weaponize dinosaurs

189
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,419
because that was so well last time and

190
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,760
it really is loyal it's not really a

191
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,350
spoiler because that's the whole first

192
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,300
fucking film and now you're repeating

193
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,640
the same shit it's no sense and it still

194
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,740
makes no sense in fact it makes less

195
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,740
sense this time around alright anyways

196
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,890
so what else do we want to say in the

197
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,230
review portion of the film so the

198
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,990
average acting I mean they just weren't

199
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,590
given given much garbage

200
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,780
Bryce Dallas Howard I can't believe how

201
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,880
fucking beautiful and cute she is and

202
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,590
how awesome she is and I didn't even

203
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,830
know this but she's the daughter of Ron

204
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,000
Howard yeah no way so how does Ron

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,509
would make this alright but I love

206
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,639
alright like I want to see her in those

207
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,269
redheads

208
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,699
oh man redheads yes already anyways it's

209
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:03,040
totally sidetracked now alright but I'll

210
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,259
say that she did a good job in the

211
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,910
filming not just because she's beautiful

212
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,250
but you know they they tried to Chris

213
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,220
her Chris have some have some chemistry

214
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,540
in the film but they're kind of

215
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,610
repeating the same shit that they did in

216
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,319
the first one and then they sort of

217
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,689
reset their relationship and you got to

218
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,790
go through it all over again and yet

219
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,620
again they leave it kind of open-ended

220
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,490
and it's like good can we get some arcs

221
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,259
are their arcs cooler what terrible yeah

222
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:35,970
we'll talk about it in spoilers okay so

223
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,089
what else

224
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,160
it's the cinematography was great

225
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,769
there's some yeah yeah hallo GI to the

226
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,079
director so so actually I agree with

227
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,269
that some CGI was really good they did a

228
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,300
good mixture of you know practical with

229
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,120
the CGI but sometimes it's not that good

230
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,550
sometimes yeah you're right there's a

231
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,980
lot of CGI very little practical yeah

232
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,290
there was only one practical effect I

233
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,970
want to take that back what I meant to

234
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,680
say was there was a good practical

235
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,110
federal with the teens the t-rex inside

236
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,029
of a small cage and you're in this

237
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,879
really claustrophobic thing and I liked

238
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,100
that scene and that had practical but

239
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
yeah what I was gonna say is that the

240
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,000
CGI was really great in some scenes and

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,009
then not so good in others yeah not so

242
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,990
good almost worse than that use a

243
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,209
difference eg like different out like

244
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,129
development houses to render different

245
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,689
things and there's big scenes and they

246
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,670
they use the like ayalim for everything

247
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,019
yeah and then there's like well you

248
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,370
render that dinosaur on the background

249
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,740
it's uh it's a shame because there's no

250
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,750
there's no smart dialogue no smart

251
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,509
writing no magic left the dinosaurs are

252
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,610
kind of pushed into the back and it's

253
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:50,950
more about oh no there was one

254
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,500
like this like reminded me of like the

255
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,750
Land Before Time oh yeah yes but that

256
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,670
was that that hurt my heart and that was

257
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,130
cheap and I was like fuck you baby just

258
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,990
fuck you better movie let him swim

259
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,630
alright anyways alright so let's give a

260
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,520
final 5 min verdict so we can get to the

261
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,710
damn spoilers and and talk shit about

262
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,600
the film because it's already been out

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
for wait years in the UK so final we're

264
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,020
going to start with other Jo this time

265
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,090
so fun a verdict I did not like this

266
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,360
side characters they were annoying the

267
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,290
acting with Bryce and Chris it was fine

268
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,630
it's 5 characters what's that one guy

269
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,760
all these plays a villain that one is

270
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
longer weird-looking guy you

271
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,420
supplemental lucky if the second I

272
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,730
showed up yeah

273
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,570
predictable yeah it was and just lost

274
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,280
what the feeling every time I think of

275
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,100
dress apart I lost that okay this is

276
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,800
amazing I want to see this again I did

277
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,490
not enjoy this at all unfortunately I'm

278
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,240
gonna give this a four oh but no average

279
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,370
you'll make a god damn I don't even

280
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,200
remember what you rated the first one to

281
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,910
Joey but I'm doing all right

282
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,140
so four out of ten judges wasn't into it

283
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,650
no humor what about this the humor

284
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,530
they were trying I didn't laugh yeah

285
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,540
yeah yeah you're right the jokes were

286
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,550
less I mean even the first one had kind

287
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,270
of little more jokes

288
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,470
yeah there worked in the missile but

289
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,720
what if I ask you this what if they took

290
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,240
the Jurassic Park name off it and this

291
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
wasn't a Jurassic Park film this is just

292
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,050
another franchise of the truck not a

293
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,730
franchise ooh cold friend this is just a

294
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,400
film that wanted to do dinosaurs and

295
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,100
wanted to do humans and dinosaurs it's

296
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,749
kind of like you

297
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,480
yeah yeah you're yeah okay that's really

298
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,790
good

299
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,839
I'd have to agree with him I think this

300
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,519
movie was like very very average I think

301
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,009
this movie started off as a 5 and there

302
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,180
was some things going for it like there

303
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,290
was some release the scenes that I

304
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,509
really enjoyed some of the characters I

305
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,709
like there was also some like just

306
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,209
absolutely ridiculous things there was

307
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,100
some pain there's a lot of suspension of

308
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,230
disbelief in this yeah you have to and I

309
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,240
just wasn't there and we I mean we had a

310
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,439
lot of beers it was like couldn't

311
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:12,490
couldn't do it I mean they have the

312
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,769
dress park names on it they they try day

313
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,209
they try to get to me with John Williams

314
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,980
I try to get to me with these these

315
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,350
callback scenes they were just you know

316
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,089
like a little kid in a clothing closet

317
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,889
and I'm sorry I'm spoiling something

318
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,329
that doesn't matter but they're running

319
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,980
from the roof of the velociraptor and

320
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,569
they're trying to shut the doors they're

321
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,819
not saying I didn't care because I like

322
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,129
no one there's no consequence for anyone

323
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,589
in this movie at any time there I never

324
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,300
believed that anyone who's a main

325
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,009
character like who I know their name is

326
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,499
in trouble or endeavour no never at all

327
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:44,139
so this movie gets it for it loses a

328
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:46,089
point because this is not an average

329
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:47,709
there's none average film yeah yeah like

330
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,360
they had a lot of things going for it

331
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,459
and they they put a lot of money into it

332
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,050
and they just didn't hit the mark

333
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,990
doesn't get average it's a sad to see

334
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,360
this happen to the Jurassic Park license

335
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,670
you could definitely tell look I know

336
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,679
Joe's a mega fan I'm a mega fan

337
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,389
I don't here's the thing guys I don't

338
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,059
want you to expect that we expect that

339
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,829
it's gonna be as good or better than the

340
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:09,879
original I knew it's gonna be because

341
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,860
there's there's a certain there's a

342
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,350
certain nostalgic factor to that film

343
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,209
that probably nothing will surpass in

344
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:19,629
the dinosaurs onra but this doesn't even

345
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,040
come close

346
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,279
it's more I appreciate it more as a

347
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,399
creature feature as a monster film

348
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,800
because that's what basically the last

349
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,170
half of it is not even the less it's

350
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,170
like the last 20 minutes yeah well okay

351
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,879
the dinosaurs in cages litter or the

352
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,480
entire film and what what and another

353
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
thing it's really stinks of we want to

354
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,790
not just do a trilogy we want to do a

355
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,939
post-apocalyptic world four six seven

356
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:50,990
eight nine who wouldn't love if there's

357
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,060
like an apocalyptic thing we're like the

358
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,770
dinosaurs kill everybody and we don't

359
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,690
have to see anymore well sure so you

360
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,320
just finally brought up the the one

361
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,810
positive and my final verdict is going

362
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,820
to be a six out of ten

363
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,310
much better than these guys and and

364
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,140
that's only because I'm looking at the

365
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,210
film in a completely different way don't

366
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,130
expect it to recapture my childhood if

367
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,590
and I wanted to do something different

368
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,960
it did something different I can't call

369
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,630
it different I can call it there went

370
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,820
full-on in a direction that they've

371
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,700
teased many times over in this franchise

372
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,890
they went full-on in that direction and

373
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,680
now they've opened it up and whereas

374
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,140
Star Wars last Jedi made me like I don't

375
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,060
really give a shit about the next film

376
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,920
and how it's gonna conclude the way this

377
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,770
ends I'm like okay maybe we'll see some

378
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,960
of what you know we'll see something oh

379
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,820
my god talk about in spoilers alright so

380
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,620
we'll see something interesting in the

381
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,930
next one you can go wild because this is

382
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,790
going to be a trilogy it's a planned

383
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,060
trilogy 2021 we actually have to wait

384
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,010
three years for the next bad maybe this

385
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,720
one it'll be like well there's big news

386
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,280
in movies today right because like a

387
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,630
bunch of movies just got put on the show

388
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,520
because of yeah so hopefully this movie

389
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,230
won't do well and they'll just say no no

390
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,510
III don't know it does kind of have this

391
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,920
opening where you could end it there if

392
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,520
you want it

393
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,950
alright guys final verdict is six out of

394
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,160
ten which for me ties the original I

395
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,110
thought the original was very poor and

396
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,420
in certain act aspects but this one I

397
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,120
think was well directed I just the

398
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,520
material there the story there the

399
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,820
dialogue that the movie the movie which

400
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,920
is not very good but for me it was my

401
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,960
only above average because I was like

402
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,130
you know what you're going in an

403
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,050
interesting direction but there are so

404
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,420
many subplots that they completely just

405
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,060
kind of ignore they drop this bomb about

406
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,680
a character and then they just move on

407
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,050
so maybe I should bring it down to a

408
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,380
five but I just don't want this ever

409
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,930
yeah but usual thing I didn't like the

410
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,570
first one and I and I liked moments of

411
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,769
this one better than the FIR

412
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,550
one Jurassic world so I I'm gonna leave

413
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,199
it at six out of ten working one of the

414
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,910
fucking spoilers so I can talk about it

415
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,410

partner who disagreed with him and

423

still has the amber thing and and I

425
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,690
don't know where he comes from maybe it

426
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,279
was in the first film I don't remember

427
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,529
this guy in the first film but he's this

428
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,529
rich dude who selects a successor to

429
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,960
spend his money and the successor is

430
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,090
what I was talking about the capitalist

431
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,340
and it wants to make the bud Nene wants

432

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,760
them so they show up with a team of

435
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,830
course the team betrays the characters

436
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,929
we know all they wanted was the tracker

437
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,149
they get them all in a boat then they

438
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:12,220
try to sell them off fuckin you know

439
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,899
hunting style to rich people from Russia

440
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:18,260
I am - I am from - yeah I will play

441
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,720
speed of millions it's like you've seen

442
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,820
this film a thousand eyes evil rich be

443
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,010
so good he wanted to save him right he

444
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,480
wanted to put him to the island it was

445
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,299
just the younger guys Ryan right at

446
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,010
first I thought that the old grandpa

447
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,960
dude was actually evil as well and

448
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,520
that's why he got us separated from

449
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,470
Haman here but no it turns out he was

450
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,480
but see that was weakest fuck seriously

451
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,860
I don't know what he's doing at all no

452
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,970
here you're getting a whole bunch of

453
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,730
dinosaurs in a boat when you try to

454
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,240
transport him into some other island

455
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,880
that they said did you not know all the

456
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,409
construction that was going on

457
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:04,520
underneath so under his house he's got

458
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,409
this fucking complex that can house a

459
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,230
certain amount of - there's no no mouth

460
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,990
and all the rich people show up and yeah

461
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,720
but dammit so anyway this daughter Kara

462
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,039
the granddaughter turns out to be a

463
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,779
dinosaur no that would have been fucking

464
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,120
stupid I've heard rumors that plants

465
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,220
eCos was gonna cross human DNA with

466
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,559
I'm glad I'm glad they never did that

467
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,749
but no they just dropped this thing that

468
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,789
she's a fucking clone he has perfected

469
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:35,980
human cloning and instead of doing

470
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,990
anything with it and telling anyone

471
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,259
about it he's done nothing and then the

472
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:42,820
movie just kind of moves on from that

473
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,619
yeah oh my god here comes a dinosaur

474
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,999
let's all run but now there's a there's

475
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,769
an orphan kid and then there's two

476
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,659
adults a male and a female so naturally

477
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,340
they had to adopt her that's how he's

478
00:19:51,340 --> 00:20:00,269
working if she's got millions of dollars

479
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,149
yeah the anime weaponized the Raptor

480
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:08,889
they take blues DNA combine it with no

481
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,799
Rex from the first film make indirect

482
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,350
smaller less deadly less intelligent

483
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,960
less weaponized but it's in a smaller

484
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,259
form so it takes orders Raptor oh it

485
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,999
takes orders from a gun where you point

486
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:25,210
a laser and it goes and then he'll

487
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,080
attack whatever that thing is so on the

488
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,789
battlefield how do you apply that you

489
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,799
have to still have the fucking soldier

490
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,539
shoot the soldier and now that fucking

491
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,779
thing goes crazy all the fuckin soldiers

492
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,809
as long as there's no tanks helicopters

493
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,929
planes yeah guns that go really far away

494
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:46,899
why like really big pits that couldn't

495
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:50,289
jump over or logs that fell down in

496
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,600
between me and the Raptor and he can't

497
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,529
get past the log cuz logs are wood Joe

498
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,200
and the ultimate weapon that was just

499
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,970
discipline those weren't even he's

500
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,220
trying to get it they fight in this old

501
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,200
museum display in the rich guys house

502
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,490
with this fucking indigo Rex or Indigo

503
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,350
Raptor and OH wrapped in dough wrapped

504
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,529
or whatever and but so what I was saying

505
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,179
is the satisfying parts is you get to

506
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,639
see the rich people get fucking

507
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,450
brutalized and murdered there was a

508
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,820
little bit more like ripping of arms off

509
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,619
and ripping of bodies that I didn't

510
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,720
expect and and there's a little bit of

511
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,820
blood in the film so it's like

512
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,610
a little monster like three rich people

513
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,770
died I know but that's why I said they

514
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,300
kind of fucked that up too yeah they got

515
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,430
like there was like but dinosaur the kid

516
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,530
ahead buddy's everybody but the

517
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,180
dinosaurs didn't eat any of the rich

518
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,550
people yeah but I was exactly that's why

519
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,630
they fuck it up because I want the

520
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,390
dazzles there goes the Russian guys

521
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,390
there goes the they always do generic

522
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,620
people they always have a fucking

523
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,230
Russian guys Saudi guy like dude from

524
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,380
Iran and oh these are all bad guys or

525
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,720
something I don't know

526
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,770
rich people bad guys who want to buy a

527
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,470
triceratops baby for their kid but

528
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,440
honestly that probably would happen

529
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,340
every two people I have a lot of money

530
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,260
thing and then they spend it on but

531
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,390
those prices for those dinosaurs ate way

532
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,730
too fucking low like five million

533
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,440
dollars for a dinosaur dude

534
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,180
five million dollars of buy you like a

535
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,060
fucking you know less than a Bugatti you

536
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,580
know a fucking car Dino dinosaur should

537
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,860
be like a hundred million dollars per

538
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,040
dinosaur this is so far into the

539
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,240
universe that there's just like it's

540
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,570
everywhere no there's only 11 of these

541
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,280
species left and there's not even this

542
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,560
so they had dead bats and bats and max

543
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,000
of all the stuff they packed it up at

544
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,040
the end okay so it's not bad that's

545
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,890
right they did out of miles so dead 11

546
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,830
living ones here 11 living okay and they

547
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,630
were just gonna hunt those to earn a

548
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,580
little bit of money so that they could

549
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,220
do their enterprise of weaponized

550
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,570
dinosaurs and and these 11 species got

551
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,970
released into the world and now we're

552
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,520
gonna have miss Jurassic world but they

553
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,390
better

554
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,710
Brice's like no we have to let them die

555
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,310
oh yeah yeah yeah so they're basically

556
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,710
stuck and this is the whole point of the

557
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,170
film was Bryce couldn't let them die

558
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,340
because we can't let these creatures die

559
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,870
even though there might be a threat to

560
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,970
humanity we can't let him die so she

561
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,160
goes on into an island and then does all

562
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,710
this bullshit to get them done and then

563
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,240
when they're trapped in a small room

564
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,580
with fucking smoke coming in she can't

565
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,110
do is you can't let him

566
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,690
and I can't let t-rex out right next to

567
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,550
its daddy made no sense for her

568
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,800
character though I know nothing about

569
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,960
this and it turns it was really just a

570
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,580
contrived reason to get the little girl

571
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,370
clone girl it's open to the door they're

572
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,180
alive

573
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,460
yeah bitch but they don't fucking eat

574
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,620
humans like yeah the fuck no bitch

575
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,180
you're laughing you go down there and

576
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,630
bet one kilo you were just running

577
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,870
around being oh yeah see how you

578
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,610
wouldn't let all these and she's the

579
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,230
first person to let them all out yeah

580
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,300
bullshit yeah they do

581
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,160
they recreate that the scene with the

582
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,170
kids running from the Raptors just in a

583
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,180
slightly different way with her running

584
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,330
away from this new hybrid Raptor coming

585
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,100
after her down a hallway and you were

586
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,490
just like okay I mean I saw the it's a

587
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,990
crowd-pleasing movie because I saw the

588
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,670
audience just freaking out there was a

589
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,280
mushrooms there's a chick that she was

590
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,160
on mushrooms - yeah they were adults and

591
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,260
they were going crazy so maybe those

592
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,480
people whenever I heard a girl over

593
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,950
there I've never heard an audience

594
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,840
member talk like I wanted to go

595
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,730
introduce myself to her like do you

596
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,530
wanna kill the angry Joe show she was

597
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,380
like just stupid this part was stupid

598
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,510
and this part was stupid I'm nervous but

599
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,640
do you say that because to me I think

600
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,620
most of the audience enjoyed it yeah

601
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,420
from what I heard in the background I

602
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,400
did enjoyed it I mean it was it was

603
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,640
there it wasn't bad there's nothing like

604
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,110
horrible about this movie it's just

605
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,390
there's nothing good about mostly like

606
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,430
y'all gave it a 4 yeah it's a book it's

607
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,950
a below-average movie yeah III gave it a

608
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,500
6 above average in the sense of the

609
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,550
dinosaurs were you know well and well I

610
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,650
did super good acting in the different

611
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,660
okay tell somebody you seen that almost

612
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,480
made no ha so there's taping the island

613
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,590
and like baby

614
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,300
all of these dinosaurs have already died

615
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
but they they had this like really

616
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,290
gratuitous shot where the brontosaurus

617
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,120
is like running down the it's on us here

618
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,830
when there's lava coming it's like

619
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,710
waving

620
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,350
and it's pretty it's like joke don't

621
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,240
leave don't leave and then the smoke

622
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,769
takes over and it dies real slow and I

623
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:58,999
got a little bit of lucky little foots

624
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,830
mom like I just remembered it was like

625
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,619
you know it pissed me off because I knew

626
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:05,840
I was being played with you know what I

627
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,419
mean and and I didn't like it but it

628
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:10,039
still got me and I was like mother

629
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,580
fuckers them have stay in the island and

630
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,350
try to save the dinosaurs maybe somehow

631
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,999
that whole selling saying and my having

632
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,710
the dinosaurs be it like the dinosaurs

633
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,360
were in cages in this movie for mold

634
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,830
like most of the movie yeah they did

635
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,720
then no part in there they're in the

636
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,210
cage and so it was just these evil black

637
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,190
market people and a kid running around a

638
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,749
house and apparently that no one works

639
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,820
in this house no one this house is

640
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,980
gigantic and then there's one nanny lady

641
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,169
and that's one evil guy it's like this

642
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:40,519
little girls running around being a

643
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,139
detective and the dumbwaiter

644
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:44,419
goes down to the secret compound the

645
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,960
ancient is open a five okay no above

646
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,639
average you told them above ever I

647
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,379
should have said five because I just

648
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:52,879
realize you know when the rich guys are

649
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,409
bidding on the thing and then they

650
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,240
unleash the dinosaur there's literally

651
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,779
two guys to guard the whole dinosaurs

652
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:01,460
who are in cages that are bringing out

653
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,799
the most dangerous dinosaurs you've ever

654
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,649
seen stress one guy with a gun and one

655
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:13,460
guy with more people spend more money oh

656
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,299
fuck

657
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,029
dammit bullets don't hurt dinosaurs

658
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:19,190
except for that one time in the movie

659
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,200
where they shot the main dinosaur in the

660
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,289
leg and then it almost died true which

661
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:25,429
main diagnosis Lou

662
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,230
they shot blue in the leg once and then

663
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,639
she's like hemorrhaging and like dying

664
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,080
and they spend a lot of a movie trying

665
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,580
to get blood and then they shoot a bunch

666
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,809
of other dinosaurs it does not honor

667
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:36,290
shoot the hybrid dinosaur the

668
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,380
go know the yellow one and that one is

669
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,300
kind of bulletproof because you see some

670
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,720
bullets fall from it but they shot glue

671
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,790
the leg yeah I know because blue is not

672
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,740
the fucking in hand Super Soldier

673
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,930
dinosaur the decree the bad guys have

674
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,250
guns and all these dinosaurs are running

675
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,570
out killing the rich and they just they

676
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,430
don't right they didn't they brought

677
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,950
like four security guys and Chris Pratt

678
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,170
beat up all of them in a set like

679
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,700
there's a scene it's a long scene uncut

680
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,260
raised running down like clotheslining

681
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,330
dudes and then he's an animal trainer

682
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,550
three months but he's like a badass kid

683
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,230
like kicking the ass of all these people

684
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,560
with guns and tasers and things

685
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,000
literally no character floods he's just

686
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,890
the best in everything well that's fine

687
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,330
cuz he's he's pretty awesome

688
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,250
he's a cool guy and I haven't beer with

689
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,020
it but yeah like I said the whole

690
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,840
mansion scene should be cut out yeah cut

691
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,280
out well that was that I think that was

692
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,130
the whole point

693
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,780
yes no this is the whole point of the

694
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,360
film so to get the dinosaurs loose to

695
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,600
charge so that fucking the tiny cameo

696
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,150
from Jeff Goldblum or at least literally

697
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,310
just reading the longest dialogue and

698
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,640
the most pretentious down it yet is

699
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,470
shirt on like I want him lying on the

700
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,860
table gray hairs hanging up geez you're

701
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,920
sure I'm not DG I guess I take it yeah

702
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,960
yeah that would have been a much more

703
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,570
compelling argument if they did we have

704
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,820
to listen to this man look at ya he's a

705
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,880
sexy man but so now dinosaurs are

706
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,750
unleashed on suburbia and all of the

707
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,440
evil world powers including Russia Iran

708
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,410
and Saudi Arabia and all these countries

709
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,030
now have dinosaur DNA and so now humans

710
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,760
must live amongst the dinosaurs they say

711
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,420
and then they show that really big fish

712
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,940
type of dinosaur that kept eating ladies

713
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,840
in the first film I was going along with

714
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,570
the surfer more the role because that

715
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,400
was in the beginning of the scene and

716
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,640
then that's it yeah it was just that he

717
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,539
just got away something but obvious one

718
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,009
cool none of these ones that were

719
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,600
unleashed on in the wild or they're all

720
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,429
gonna die off there's no male/female

721
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:54,409
they're not gonna reproduce and they're

722
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:55,970
supposed to be 11 of each species yeah

723
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,710
but there's just a single one they don't

724
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,269
have a male female or anything like that

725
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:01,309
but it's probably gonna come from the

726
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:07,249
way that's impossible

727
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,769
they have this DF Dino DNA and what they

728
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:12,379
will do is they will tweak the DNA to

729
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,210
make males do it all the FEMA at the

730
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,429
weapons and so then it will finally get

731
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:17,960
the true movie that I've been waiting

732
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,679
for is what's that cartoon series where

733
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:29,840
they put the fucking missile I bought

734
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,970
the toys so that's what they're setting

735
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,710
up I thought it's gonna be then are a

736
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,809
see part three if you ever see that show

737
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:41,559
dinosaurs

738
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,220
okay anyway I'm going full-on action way

739
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,019
I want to see fucking dinosaurs and

740
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,450
lasers and fucking Triceratops is with

741
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,960
would fucking missile racks and

742
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,159
post-apocalyptic because they put a

743
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:57,710
little bit of they're like wow Planet of

744
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,690
the Apes is done really well that's put

745
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,389
a little bash of that in there so anyway

746
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:04,970
it's getting out of control Universal or

747
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,979
who does this is get a little out of

748
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:08,989
control Universal let's wrap it up in

749
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:12,559
the third film but that's all I'm just

750
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,359
know I want that one because I want to

751
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,129
see the fucking dinosaur lasers so the

752
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:24,200
ending credits scene go too big okay so

753
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,599
nothing happens so we waited for a

754
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,789
post-credits scene and looked it up and

755
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,289
they're like yeah there's something at

756
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,029
the end don't wait for it it's literally

757
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:34,759
what Joe said pterodactyls they Eiffel

758
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,519
to perch on the fake Eiffel Tower in

759
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,849
Vegas so I get and but that's it it is

760
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:43,999
five seconds long and I'm trying to

761
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:46,369
determine why they needed to put that in

762
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:48,019
there I guess they're hinting that the

763
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,919
third film everybody guys everybody guys

764
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,919
the third film is gonna be in new of Las

765
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,159
Vegas awesome that's what we're doing

766
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:58,720
with a friend

767
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,460
says the most like yeah Las Vegas with

768
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,030
dinosaurs evil Las Vegas with lasers and

769
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,549
missile racks and post apocalyptic I

770
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,679
wanted to jumpy I wanted to jump 30

771
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,610
years let me go with the baby if this

772
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,500
was called something else instead of a

773
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,539
Jurassic Park I think it'd be fucking

774
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:26,860
cool idea so give me that move something

775
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,429
else yes all right but I'm hoping but

776
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:32,500
that's what Jurassic world 3 is

777
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,289
otherwise I don't want to see it alright

778
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,390
thank you so much for watching this is

779
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,770
way too long when you're shooting this

780
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,620
you would use so cool anything else of

781
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,480
