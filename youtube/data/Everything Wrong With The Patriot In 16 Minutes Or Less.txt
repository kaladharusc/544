2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,710
not a selling point also this is

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,540
Benjamin's box of plot specific trinkets

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,120
time long feared that this movie would

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,680
start with narration shucking corn

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,180
immediately after picking it instead of

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,439
waiting to shuck it until right before

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,180
cooking it because movie believes the

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,470
audience is too dumb to identify

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,420
uncooked corn as corn and to that I say

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,609
shuck you movie question why build a

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,810
fence around your house if you're going

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,970
to leave gaps this why this is jest the

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,650
fence is only decorative but this is pre

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,660
American Revolution when time would 100%

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,790
be better spent on crops animals and

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,290
general chores over building a giant

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,510
functionless decorative fence these kids

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,129
are addicted their family's crops we're

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,239
closing in on two minutes of these

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,950
characters reacting to the mail to be

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,719
fair this is the same reaction I have to

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,340
that little red one appearing on the

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,260
icon for my email client main character

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,550
is terrible at building rocking chairs

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,920
cliche wait what rocking chairs were

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,449
common pieces of furniture until the

28
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,520
early 1800s why not have been failed at

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,960
making tables turn on rocking

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,940
era-appropriate chairs expositional

31
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,500
breeding Mel Gibson's character has a

32
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,690
dead wife girlfriend daughter cliche so

33
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,540
what was in the mail roland emmerich

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,220
throws audiences a curveball by making a

35
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,049
film without a bad father sure he's

36
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,670
overbearing but Mel's clearly playing a

37
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,200
good and loving father in this movie and

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,580
let's just say everyone has an off day

39
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,439
even roland emmerich this list of names

40
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,270
is not in alphabetical order though they

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,740
do start out that way for about four or

42
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,320
five names he's 17 and year younger than

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,600
I oh the late 1700s when eighteen year

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,770
old males still had to ask her parents

45
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,960
permission for the CGI probably look

46
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,159
great when this movie came out but

47
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,780
that's the thing about CGI is it the age

48
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,430
is faster than an NFL running back

49
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,229
I support cleavage just as much as the

50
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,520
next guy but I have to point out this

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,409
movie put this nice lady and the other

52
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,060
support female characters and dresses

53
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,200
that would be considered quite revealing

54
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,750
for the time huge what have you been

55
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,700
feeding them well they're from good

56
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,430
stock on their mother's side of course I

57
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,780
realize his wife's been dead three years

58
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,520
and he's probably horny but in movie

59
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,509
time this is considered moving too fast

60
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,560
whooping Charlotte has presents for her

61
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,689
sister's kids upon their arrival for the

62
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,850
big Revolutionary War book happy maybe

63
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,829
we all dive out kids here's a ball in a

64
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,170
cup game and he put the CD Telegraph's

65
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,640
feature love story via accidental

66
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,530
bumping a time-honored tradition this

67
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,929
Howard is me you know who I am Gabriel

68
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,420
Martin the last time you saw me I was 11

69
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,989
and you put ink in my tea

70
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,269
if you were 11 last time Heather if you

71
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,920
recognize each other this time even had

72
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,730
this conversation

73
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,219
you sing 18 which means she's at least

74
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,379
16 year old and this is colonial America

75
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,569
not a daily Facebook update Society so

76
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,709
they should have much more trouble

77
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,390
recognizing each other and our rights

78
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,900
are being threatened by a tyrant 3,000

79
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,200
miles away hmm South Carolina to the UK

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,569
it's actually nearly 4,000 but maybe

81
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,450
you're rounding down by the thousand the

82
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,069
levy past at basically a two-to-one

83
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,930
differential this hanging around outside

84
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,280
the courthouse to hear about the vote

85
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,079
contingent is apparently 100 percent per

86
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,120
levy as there is one person in this show

87
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,609
that appears upset or sad do you intend

88
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,980
to invoice for that my from me well he

89
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,569
is a legal adult seems like only

90
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,459
yesterday when we last saw each other in

91
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,500
Charlestown letter-writing not so

92
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,419
cleverly disguised as narration snooping

93
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,730
while axe fingering guns and cannons are

94
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,169
going off and Benjamin doesn't demand

95
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,340
that his children go back inside the

96
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,400
house they'll probably kill us when I do

97
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,040
lord knows what do you wanna what

98
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,500
stop Tommy Tommasino has some tough

99
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,299
near-future fantasies I mean who even

100
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,669
thinks about this Jesus and I'm supposed

101
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,049
to be happy each time he gets saved in

102
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:26,979
this movie oh yeah

103
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,510
as I watched this panning shot of

104
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,220
Revolutionary War action from afar

105
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,079
I am in awe this might be the single

106
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,400
finest thing Roland Emmerich has ever

107
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,319
filmed as a 2 credits shy history minor

108
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,139
Bravo sir to syndra moon this would be

109
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,790
creepy if I hadn't already seen a second

110
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,290
drastic park movie British decide to

111
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,909
send all their available troops to the

112
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,620
area to finish off the 12 wounded

113
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,120
soldiers from last night's battle all

114
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,799
slaves of the American colonies who

115
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,109
fight for the crown will be granted

116
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,000
their freedom we're not slaves

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,139
I think it's worth noting that most

118
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,489
South Carolinians with wealth of the

119
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,019
time own slate the fact that the hero of

120
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,519
this movie is an outlier who does not

121
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,109
seems a bit of a script coincidence

122
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,900
rebel dispatches sir they were so poorly

123
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,370
hidden in this humongous house that I

124
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,349
found them in seconds also goddamn me

125
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,909
Fletcher's character hide that important

126
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,470
when you show up at home or tell your

127
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,069
dad to hide it Jesus come god damn it

128
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,659
you kept up the ruse all this way only

129
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,220
to ruin it with an impulsive father

130
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,019
this kid is stupid as hell and honestly

131
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,190
the entire rest of the movie including

132
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,900
Mel's involvement is due to this kids

133
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,549
stupidity you could argue that as this

134
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,020
movie presents things the Americans

135
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,190
would have lost their war for

136
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,810
independence at this one South Carolina

137
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,400
guy's kid hadn't so foolishly gotten

138
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,950
himself

139
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,450
luckily for Ben none of his weapons were

140
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,220
damaged in that fire not only that he's

141
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,600
able to walk out of the house like it

142
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,160
isn't even on fire hopefully this is a

143
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,660
sign that the Martins can still live in

144
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,130
their house and peacefully coexist with

145
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,140
the fire this rescue was badass and it

146
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,540
makes sense yes farmer in 1776 would

147
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,460
have taught his sons to shoot and yes he

148
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,810
would definitely know the nearby terrain

149
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,190
better than the British I'm taking one

150
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,720
cent off goddamn it I don't know a lot

151
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,100
about guns but I would assume these

152
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,690
rifles would be challenging to aim yes

153
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,280
Benjamin and his two sons continue to

154
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,390
shoot dead every one of their targets

155
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,920
it's like they're anti stormtroopers

156
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,630
these British troops are adhering to the

157
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,040
fight the good guy one of the time rule

158
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,750
that all bad guys must adhere to in

159
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,860
every movie that will be made until the

160
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,630
end of time if you look up over till in

161
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,100
the video dictionary this clip comes up

162
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,050
immediately and hey let's count the X

163
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,760
blow these levels on this fool shall we

164
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,730
just for posterity one two three four

165
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,080
five too many

166

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,810
and childhood trauma counseling as an

168
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,030
industry what's Leslie born also this is

169
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,680
Roland Emmerich's first rated our film

170
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,150
since Universal Soldier and it's

171
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,620
basically just for this one scene I

172
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,760
think there's some more violence later

173
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,950
blood but no boobs or f-bombs or even s

174
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,620
bombs is s bombs I think cuz it should

175
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,030
be even if it's not this mother they're

176
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,440
still alive enough to move his eyes and

177
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
head before apparently dying stabbed

178
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,110
Williams didn't kill it the

179
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,820
cinematographers close-up tit for good

180
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,980
with us I'll see what I can do

181
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,100
yes thanks now try nestle in a few days

182
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,870
we'll all be nearly killed and have to

183
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,390
flee but for now sleep child you've done

184
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,830
nothing for which you should be ashamed

185
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,390
the only place is here now I'm going

186
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,880
back I'm a soldier it's my duty yep

187
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,470
nearly three our movie has time to

188
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,850
repeat basically the same argument they

189
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,470
had when he first enlisted also maybe

190
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,850
the title of this film actually refers

191
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,500
to Gabriel thankfully Heath Ledger gets

192
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,150
to avoid this obviously deadly battle

193
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,590
because he decided to go trespassing for

194
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,300
funsies even though Gabriel left a few

195
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,010
hours before Benjamin did Benjamin still

196
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,330
had enough time to catch up to Gabriel

197
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,430
find him in this house and Batman behind

198
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,110
him only Brigade - hardly react to the

199
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,400
obvious surprise of seeing his father

200
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,830
behind him no running back a lot more

201
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,500
importantly oh did you find him even if

202
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,670
you knew what unit he was in you'd have

203
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,230
to have shown up hours ago and stalked

204
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,940
him to show up here and now no this

205
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,710
extended bloody military hospital shot

206
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,660
is intended to make you puke - I can't

207
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,800
think of any other reason this shot

208
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,840
exists I usually trust the French to

209
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
keep their word that's Frances casual

210
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,370
triple hanging is casual also these

211
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,690
people had a church service before

212
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,910
cutting down these hanging victims we

213
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,700
are here to pray for the souls of those

214
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,190
men hanging outside why didn't you cut

215
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,840
them down before praying for them will

216
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
be kind of rips off Rudy but takes its

217
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,050
sweet-ass time doing so and I'm this

218
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,580
close to just adding 50 sins for

219
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,170
frustration so I'm holding off for now

220
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,640
with candle light like this it's a

221
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,110
wonder the swamp based hidden Spanish

222
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,760
mission manages to stay a hideout for as

223
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,270
long as it does world all men I created

224
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,120
equal unto God jesus H Christ having a

225
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,800
white male character in a Revolutionary

226
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,480
War movie say this to a black man made

227
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,529
my eyes were also hard I'm dizzy

228
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,389
yeah this woman cannot tell the

229
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,829
difference between fireworks and a ship

230
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,229
exploding she's wasted y'all I've come

231
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,299
to call on Anne movie makes Ann's father

232
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,739
death too needlessly pad the movie's

233
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,749
runtime holy crap the situation went

234
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:31,679
from I have come to calling your

235
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,939
daughter too I'm spending the night you

236
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,259
better sell me in so I don't touch your

237
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,489
daughter in like six hours

238
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,959
Gabriel is unaware of the situation

239
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,639
regarding his feet because he is unable

240
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,619
to taste ink for some reason I made this

241
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,719
for you to God of course to represent

242
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:44,399
the violence of my day-to-day life and

243
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,719
because I believe you're ready for guns

244
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,819
at the ripe old age of six she gave him

245
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,739
the ink tea twelve hours ago I've got a

246
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:50,999
simple goodbye kiss at this point

247
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,529
transferred that much ink into her mouth

248
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,389
my point is this smile is to Enki to be

249
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,919
believable this attack is what happens

250
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,149
when guerrilla revolutionary war

251
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,229
fighters get a taste of their own

252
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:02,819
medicine wait whose side am I on movie

253
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,409
continues to overestimate the range of

254
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:05,849
the flip-flop distort this is one of the

255
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,499
best scenes in the movie now shows up

256
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,239
with Cornwallis's dogs and bargains a

257
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,860
prisoner exchange even though he has no

258
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,659
British prisoners and after all is said

259
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,949
and done the prisoners are released and

260
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:15,599
the dogs leave Cornwallis and stay with

261
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,879
Gibson and Friends priceless my question

262
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,589
is how the fuck did they get those dogs

263
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,179
so bonded with them in a few days with

264
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,519
just mutant bones aren't dogs loyal we

265
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,989
never get any indication that Cornwallis

266
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,489
mistreated them or anything they just

267
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,259
apparently like Mel Gibson more than

268
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,909
they do Tom Wilkinson after three days

269
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,860
I've seen YouTube videos of real dogs

270
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,779
that freaked out when their army owner

271
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,009
returns home from active duty after

272
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,169
several years what gives this guy needs

273
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,000
a spyglass to see them riding 80 yards

274
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,919
away this is the single most useless use

275
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,689
of a telescopic device in film history

276
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,629
just eyeball that here I mean Jesus that

277
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,649
man and stalks me quite impressive for a

278
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,540
farmer with a pitchfork wouldn't you say

279
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,339
this guy flirts with insubordination so

280
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,720
hard you might as well be the anti

281
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,879
employee the month but to do so requires

282
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,399
the use of tactics but a somewhat queer

283
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,540
folks that will do an orchard whose

284
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,029
brutal form all as easily goes along

285
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,319
with this even though I have trouble

286
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,550
believing that given the immense power

287
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,930
of the British military burning a church

288
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,430
filled with townsfolk is the only

289
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,930
effective method for finding Benjamin

290
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,959
tell me about Ohio it's currently

291
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,610
inhabited by lots of natives you get to

292
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,019
kill with no repercussions you'll love

293
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,690
it what do you know about it

294
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,520
everything I can tell you the size of

295
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
his boot does he have family movie

296
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,820
thinks I need more reasons to hate this

297
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,680
guy and also things wants to kill

298
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,210
children is what's going to tick me up

299
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,470
another anger not when he's already

300
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,670
killed children including Benjamin

301
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,170
Martin's children in this movie already

302
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,320
we have coming thank God it Charlotte is

303
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,010
a light sleeper

304
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,660
these guys are seeking this family out

305
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,370
to kill them but they walk in all slow

306
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,050
and steady moving slowly is somehow

307
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,740
their friend

308
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,330
just open the door run upstairs and

309
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,460
slaughtery an idiot this movie does not

310
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,840
give British people a good name in the

311
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,490
area of battlefield intelligence this is

312
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,050
one of those movie moves where they just

313
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,700
give the finger to everyone the bad guy

314
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,380
was sure he was under there we as an

315
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,150
audience knew for sure he was under

316
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,160
there but then nope sometimes when we

317
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,750
weren't looking he got out I bet even

318
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,520
that kid himself is confused as to what

319
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,560
happened but good tension movie I guess

320
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,930
cheater also there is a huge obvious

321
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,580
shadow top right of the shot that the

322
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,900
evil guy should totally check out

323
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,220
because it's actually the child he

324
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,330
thought was under the table but he

325
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,540
totally doesn't and the kids just go

326
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,160
instead of saying I've never been here

327
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,390
in the secret tunnel before and don't

328
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,490
know the way that tunnel led them to

329
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,380
here right the kingside the house and in

330
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,730
full view of anyone paying attention

331
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,650
which this passing british soldier is

332
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,270
not doing this might be in contention

333
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,950
for the luckiest escape ever i'll have

334
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,320
to check my records god dammit gabriel

335
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,150
knew his skin to all these people hiding

336
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,710
behind the bush broke his rifle first

337
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,870
why because it's a movie you idiot and

338
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,980
roland emmerich wanted to make you think

339
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,240
for a moment these people had all been

340
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,160
captured logically damned I feel sorry

341
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
for her but this is merely the second

342
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,460
house we've seen her living in so she's

343
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,570
rich she'll be fine

344
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,830
seconds after this order the soldiers

345
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,390
peace out without having found anyone

346
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,920
that is one of those horrifying dolls

347
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,450
I've seen since that Seinfeld episode

348
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,710
where susan has a doll that looks just

349
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,420
like George's mother what did she say

350
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,260
she said that she loves here and misses

351
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,839
you why does he lie about this why not

352
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,670
just say she spoke and let Dad be happy

353
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,710
that she finally spoke I make up untrue

354
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,030
comments about her loving and missing

355
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,920
her father so that later when he sees

356
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,180
her he'll be even more heartbroken

357
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,550
Southington has a list of our men he's

358
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,260
burning our homes okay so maybe the

359
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,700
homes of these vigilante soldiers are

360
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,770
being burned well that's terrible and

361
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,510
tragic but more importantly who wrote

362
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,310
down a list of your names who gave it to

363
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,080
tavington you've been an off books rogue

364
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,700
outfit from the start only one of you

365
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,990
here are the inside could have written

366
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,700
down all the family names and addresses

367
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,890
of the participants knowing this British

368
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,400
asshole

369
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,660
killed children is not enough we

370
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,890
apparently also need to see dead

371
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,600
children on screen to get the point

372
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,860
finding out his family is dead leads

373
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,300
this guy to shoot himself in the head I

374
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,620
just want to point out that the movie

375
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,180
does nowhere near enough to show his

376
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,890
friends and fellow soldiers dealing with

377
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,750
witnessing that kind of trauma yeah sure

378
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,950
we got some sad faces

379
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,330
I'm telling you firsthand witnessing a

380
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,190
suicide or even its aftermath would a

381
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,410
person up why does the only recently

382
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,910
speaking daughter just trust her dad why

383
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,130
silly viewer we're never told obviously

384
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,440
some good stock on their father's side

385
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,330
hey remember when Benjamin said that to

386
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,830
Charlotte earlier I don't because that

387
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,110
happened 8,000 hours ago finally safe in

388
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,880
the african-american beach paradise this

389
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,830
family sleeps together and I do not know

390
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,180
how either of these adults in this shot

391
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,470
get any sleep at all given the

392
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,450
arrangement kids sure they're good

393
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,010
basically pretty much no matter what and

394
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,420
they move around a lot making the shot

395
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,070
even less believable oh wait he's not

396
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,380
asleep and she's not asleep but somehow

397
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,380
it feels even worse you once said when I

398
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,850
had a family of my own that I'd

399
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,700
understand you were right trying to tell

400
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,380
me something the timing of this girl's a

401
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,630
rival makes Gabriel a wizard like a

402
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,670
legit magical person I mean I love

403
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,500
CityTime this conversation so perfectly

404
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,720
I don't the director said hey let's have

405
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,190
you eat an apple in this shot and share

406
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,390
it with your son since everything about

407
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,740
this particular moment in the film and

408
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,450
its timing is actually an asshole thank

409
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,890
God the local clergyman was part of the

410
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,420
militia otherwise the ceremony would

411
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,770
have to have been officiated by some

412
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,270
internet certified under qualified

413
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,340
person like Joey Tribbiani also was

414
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,200
Gabriel traveling as a militia guy with

415
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,060
a white suit for marriage purposes or

416
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,560
did his Brides family bring that with

417
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,880
them so now perfectly guess his

418
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,400
measurements ancestry country no it's

419
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,600
not isn't that the point of those

420
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,670
three-hour movie I'm not me

421
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,710
she's right if she were her sister she'd

422
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,300
be dead wow it sure is convenient that

423
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,160
this guy's dead wife has such a rich hot

424
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,780
nurturing sister am i right this is what

425
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,910
they call over tidiness well every loose

426
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,230
end of a screenplay needs to be tied

427
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,060
office what I'm saying nice isn't she

428
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,710
hate them so much why did she even agree

429
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,800
to line up with the other so Oh screw

430
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,540
you a movie you blew your wad on this

431
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,230
emotional moment

432
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,090
ages ago I will not give in to my base

433
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,160
emotions just because you put a little

434
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,010
girl on screen it Oh for pete's sake Oh

435
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,230
someone give up for baby I did you would

436
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,710
have been better

437
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,270
what's worse these assholes showing up

438
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,250
just after Mel Gibson says this or them

439
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,380
showing up all of us we're ours do I get

440
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,480
the opportunity to kill a few redcoats

441
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,310
perhaps a few wounded ones when you're

442
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:43,779
not

443
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,120
haha yes let's only have morals when

444
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,529
they are convenient to the story

445
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,269
colonel tavington wishes to address the

446
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,790
whole village wheres honeymoon ever

447
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,529
oh you feel bad about your choices now

448
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:55,839
but not back when you add yourself with

449
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,579
the devil you do I don't care if you

450
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,319
were on Firefly the British asshole

451
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,970
burned the entire village but apparently

452
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,470
didn't think to come back by and check

453
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,149
for morning love once Benjamin is able

454
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,709
to find a small piece of jewelry in this

455
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:08,110
pile of soot ash and death that asshole

456
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,279
Gabriel took off after the British

457
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,139
murderers but only so recently has to be

458
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,699
easily followed it's almost a shame

459
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,350
Heath Ledger will always be most known

460
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,879
for the Joker because even though he

461
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,220
killed the Joker he was really good like

462
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,490
Brokeback Mountain and this movie how

463
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,019
the fuck did that guy just sense that

464
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,519
Gabriel was above him and about to kill

465
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:24,759
it

466
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,170
super-hearing and how did he know to

467
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,519
wait between the time Gabriel showed up

468
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,660
and the moment he decided to attack huh

469
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,459
Oh son that wasn't your fault

470
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:36,069
I was mine was Thomas his fault if we

471
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,269
really want to talk about it he was

472
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,860
going to decided to be a dumbass when it

473
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,149
was most important to not be a dumbass

474
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,339
so now you've lost both your two eldest

475
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,499
sons to this war keep going or give up I

476
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,879
think we know what he's going to choose

477
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,860
but only because it's a movie I don't

478
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,149
actually have a good transition shot

479
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,740
here boss so I guess we just fade to

480
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,199
black for a moment why I the men feel

481
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,600
they can justify death well suddenly

482
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,459
philosophical Benjamin asked your former

483
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,500
self that apparently utterly ravaged the

484
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,180
Native American outpost he might know

485
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,250
even though Benjamin spied that flag and

486
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,629
made up his mind yesterday he waited

487
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,069
dramatically before riding up today

488
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,569
bearing that flag for an emotional

489
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,639
moment also this is the brave hardiest

490
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,809
moment in this entire film

491
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,490
remember colonial Americans they can

492
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,069
never take off right on did we ever use

493
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:17,199
any normal bullets if I die I will die

494
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,480
ones rest for he was dying uncomfortable

495

honored to have you with us oh I forgot

497
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,720
about how the Revolutionary War ended

498
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,029
bigotry and slavery hi foolin with the

499
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,230
OL we have a bunch of guys over this

500
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,819
hill you foolishly ran over routine

501
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,920
classic two whole minutes of marking

502
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,449
engine remains hyper-focused on

503
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:36,189
tavington yet no other British regular

504
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:37,779
comes up to kill or fight him Benjamin

505
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,579
tosses his gun aside because he now has

506
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,319
the ultimate weapon the American flag

507
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,269
the only time in the history of America

508
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:44,889
were waving a flag like this fired up

509
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,179
anything other than a college football

510
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,069
crowd Will Hunting himself could sit

511
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:49,600
down and calculate the odds Ben Martin

512
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,980
would ultimately square off with his

513
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,480
British asshole on the battlefield and

514
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,470
he would have called those odds

515
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,240
astronomical and yet here we are

516
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,130

520
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,649

521

528
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,060
carcass of the gentleman from Ohio
