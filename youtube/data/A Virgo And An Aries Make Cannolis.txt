1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,660
okay join for those of you that aren't

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,120
familiar with virgos and Aries we

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,009
typically aren't supposed to really like

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,440
get along in a dating environment our

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,830
signs really don't like mesh super well

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,289
but just like everybody says astrology

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,090
bullshit and you should date and we

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,189
wanna say thank you because you're sweet

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,420
like sugar Julian is a typical Aries he

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,180
is a tornado he likes to cook with vigor

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,610
and fury I get things done really fast

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,100
and efficient I don't waste time please

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,829
I like to follow all the directions and

14
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,719
make sure that nothing is a mess and

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,280
that everything is neat and no one gets

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,520
hurt we don't it'll it always amazes me

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,750
that you guys like to watch these

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,550
because we're both vegan Julian is

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,170
celiac disease so everything that we eat

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,300
needs to also not have gluten in it of

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,930
disease

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,160
he's disease when he said he wanted

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,469
cannolis I was a little blown away

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,210
because I don't think I've had a cannoli

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,220
since I lived in Boston and I was like

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,360
there's no way there's a vegan

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,340
gluten-free cannoli but leave it's a

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,979
Pinterest beach I found this recipe on

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,140
gluten-free palate someone has done it

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,850
someone who's made a recipe and we are

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,259
following that we're gonna use it as a

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,430
rough guideline for what we're doing

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,880
today

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,770
no we're using a reference it from time

35
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,180
to time but we're gonna take the lead

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,369
this requires a deep fryer or like to

37
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,049
fry things in oil so I don't want to

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,340
mess around doing because someone's

39
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,930
gonna get hurt trying things in oil is

40
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,810
literally the best time to mess around

41
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:37,130
350 degrees no no not 355 okay fine 360

42
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,470
360 you're ready to make some good like

43
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,200
I know parts of it like it tests me

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,939
every day because half the time you do

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,350
that and you catch it and the other half

46
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,540
we go to the ER bless all you out there

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,190
that have

48
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,400
Ares loved one you are a lot love you

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,380
you're a lot to look I'm a lot as a

50
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,000
formality I have all the measuring cups

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,590
even though we're generally gonna be

52
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,090
just you're gonna find a way to get

53
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,500
every single one of them dirty to

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,850
eyeball on it which one of us is the

55
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,369
Susan chef cut we're gonna cut this

56
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,500
recipe in half but it gives you this

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,720
little yeast that we have to wonder the

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,090
third cups of water with these in this

59
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,710
little Bowl you're gonna be used

60
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,930
everywhere I'll take these to the trash

61
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,270
okay you don't have to stir things with

62
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,400
your finger you can use like a utensil

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,850
or spoon people are gonna eat things did

64
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,750
you wash your hands

65
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,800
yeah a couple hours ago see how I did

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,360
that without getting flour everywhere

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,920
like it's possible took you like 20

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,410
minutes not leave see what I'm gonna do

69
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,120
right now instead of taking this and

70
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
throwing it across the kitchen I'm gonna

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,540
go put it in the car riveting

72
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,150
see this you just ripped it off and

73
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,250
threw it I'm not sure them three cups

74
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,590
wait wait wait that's powdered sugar

75
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,820
because I thought it only went in the

76
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,110
filling that's the filling oh oh

77
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,850
three tablespoons of granulated sugar

78
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,130
this is like if I don't catch a little

79
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,630
stuff like that we end up with a

80
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,000
nightmare all the time two tables that's

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,709
very different than three cups of

82
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:16,459
powdered sugar

83
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,850
we're like baking so it needs to be like

84
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,709
relatively exact I'll go put this back

85
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,820
mmm egg

86
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,230
we're not ready for that yet I'm just

87
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,380
getting it ready

88
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,580
we're just shortening it looks like

89
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,760
butter you know no tell that out okay

90
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,110
normally they have these things called

91
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,060
cannoli molds where they're like a metal

92
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,040
tube similar to this where you like wrap

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,020
the cannoli around and you fry it like

94
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,270
that so it keeps it shape we couldn't

95
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,370
find any so I bought like a baster that

96
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,080
can withstand 500 degree heat and we're

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,610
just gonna use that this better work I

98
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,840
want cannolis here we're adding 2

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,840
tablespoons of oil any kind of oil works

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,820
no I think this is good and careful I

101
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,830
can't believe how slow your veins don't

102
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,570
put your face and I was giving it love

103
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,060
was giving a nod back in love ok ok give

104
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,590
it first of all give it some eye contact

105
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,390
okay don't overwork it or else they're

106
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,860
gonna come out really tough like just

107
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,530
enough to form a dough ball no pansy

108
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,690
little can only I want to top weathered

109
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,930
strong that's all baby work something I

110
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,700
want to can only bet is an independent

111
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,440
can only bet don't need no man come on

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,479
as with gluten-free things it'll get

113
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,070
kind of crumbly you have to do this a

114
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,200
lot with stuff we get like a Griffin

115
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,050
glass bowl on top of a dish towel so

116
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,760
that it's like ready to fall at any

117
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,550
second are you done with this no I'm

118
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,229
still using it if I wasn't so disease

119
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,970
you could just make normal flour things

120
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,560
all right so we're gonna cover it and

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
hold it in the fridge for 10 minutes and

122
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,190
then we're or 10 whatever you like we

123
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,220
getting ready to make the cream filling

124
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,000
yeah boy dear God but if me your boy

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,010
Julian thanks for giving me all this

126
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,630
energy cause some more we're adding 1/2

127
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,229
a cup of Earth Balance balance because

128
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,970
we're balanced we're not in balance

129
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,070
half a cup of palm shortening

130
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,120
you gotta do it like that and then

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
immediately after this step you have to

132
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
send five emails off of your phone

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,710
screen all right I got a quarter cup of

134
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,750
vegan ricotta right here I'm gonna make

135
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,490
a tower over here of all the ingredients

136
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,430
that we've used and the last one I'm

137
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,920
gonna dump from up here all right no you

138
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,380
start it in the bowl so it doesn't

139
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:47,840
[Music]

140
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,769
[Music]

141
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,419
it's really nutritious to put that in

142
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,979
the fridge I'm gonna just take these out

143
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:10,839
for science I'm glad I got on my hand

144
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,339
and on my shirt

145
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,199
why'd you to do that right into that

146
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:24,170
bowl we just need that

147
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,190
roll that out second free throw throw

148
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,590
that out which one you only thought well

149
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,930
I guess I'll see that happen we could

150
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,720
you go girl Oh Oh like it's still a

151
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,880
little crumbly and cracked yep it could

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,200
be worse like at least it's sticking

153
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,730
together well I think we're gonna make

154
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,800
them like a little bit small small

155
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,910
cannolis kindly cannoli knees it's too

156
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,630
thick

157
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,800
let's just see what it looks like

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,930
wrapped around here hold on should we

159
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,370
like flour this there's someone I'm

160
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,010
gonna get you dry I'm so many concerns

161
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,570
I'm really impressed with that thing it

162
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,270
just did now you broke it apart why

163
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,710
don't we try frying this one all right

164
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,310
