17
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,810
fear that

18
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,140
this is like a CNN event what is this

19
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,210
this is like a sales event it is a sales

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,119
event the National Turner's about six

21
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,539
hundred folks here so don't know about

22
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:52,610
Casey yet this is so it's I'm a surprise

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,929
do you have any advice for me when it

24
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,369
comes this of mine your relationship

25
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,619
with CNN I don't know not super he'll

26
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,700
say okay no so this is a this is the CNN

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,740
thing it's a big huge sales meeting

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,880
conference they asked me to come and

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,370
talk site to do it I haven't met any of

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,720
these people yet so this is a good way

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,299
for me to get to know them they feed out

32
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:21,239
there oh when it's done press this red

33
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,580
button and then you can turn it off with

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,599
this way but just film me walking out

35
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,890
later Anderson wait they just called me

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,420

a lot of a lot of interest in what

40
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,360
cameras I'm using in these current

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,610
episodes everything's in 4k now I think

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,410
everything looks better it's crispy or

43
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,330
it's cleaner the colors are better so

44
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,280
let me get into it real quick alright so

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,620
every episode I literally think every

46
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,350
single episode of the vlog was shot on

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,380
this bad boy they can in ATD before it I

48
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,300
use the Canon 70d the last couple of

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,950
days that have been shot on this little

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,280
guy this is the Sony a 65 hundred and

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,500
then these studio formal shots are on a

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,900
7s or a seven are two main reason why I

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,330
switched from Canon to Sony

54
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,510
is 4k I was super reluctant to actually

55
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,820
use this little guy I thought if I'm

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,400
gonna use Sony code the big guys a lot

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,709
of vloggers like Louie and Ben Brown and

58
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,780
people like that and Jesse Jesse uses

59
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,510
this huge thing to vlog with which the

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,530
image on this is almost

61
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,540
indistinguishable from the image on this

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,940
when shooting in like good to average

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,500
shooting conditions low-light this

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,090
thing's still better altogether I do

65
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,600
prefer the Sony's over the canons with

66
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,370
two major exceptions one is I do like

67
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,860
like the native color profile of Canon

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,230
better I can color grade this and I

69
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,760
still think this looks great but there's

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,900
something about this that I like better

71
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,880
and then too is the front-facing screen

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,299
it's like it's much harder to actually

73
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,790
vlog with this thing with it not having

74
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,400
a front-facing screen I mean you're just

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,380
basically shooting blind the entire time

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,090
which brings me to why I'm talking about

77
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,010
this today the single biggest problem

78
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,650
with not having a front-facing screen is

79
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,320
when you think you think you're shooting

80
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,850
with a super wide angle but it's

81
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,440
actually zoomed all the way in and

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,000
you're just getting a close-up shot of

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,040
your nose I don't need a zoom lens to

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,080
see this nose now with Canon that's not

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,090
a big deal I would have and then I could

86
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,160
see that it was although you just see I

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,690
could correct the fact that it was oom

88
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,430
doll the way in I've been struggling to

89
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,050
come up with the solution I'm not gonna

90
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,729
put an external screen on this like I

91
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,180
need to be able throw this thing around

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,330
I think I figured out how to do it and

93
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,009
this white pen contains the solution

94
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:13,460
okay I know what you're thinking

95
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,060
now at a glance you know if these white

96
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,759
stripes are lined up here then it's as

97
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,380
wide as it'll go if you look at the

98
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,669
camera and it's like that you're like oh

99
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,270
 zoomed in BAM like that and it's as

100
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,590
wide as it'll go and you never need to

101
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,300
check I hope that makes sense

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,009
I know it's wide right now because these

103
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,330
white stripes are lined up

104
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,099
I know it's tight right now because the

105
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,370
white stripes are not lined up it's all

106

years ago this is not mail time this is

116
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,360
something else because I'm pretty sure I

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
know what this is it is what I think it

118

126
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,419
they're here is because I ordered a new

127
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,270
one wheel Plus this is the latest and

128
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,430
greatest there in towns they personally

129
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,289
delivered it for me I was gonna be like

130

is there anything is there anything that

133
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,840
should tell the audience about the one

134
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,909
wheel plus you can order one wheel plus

135
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,169
at what wheel com
