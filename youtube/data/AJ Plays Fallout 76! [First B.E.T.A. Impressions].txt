137
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,339
fallout 76 not worth the pre-order and

138
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,839
stuff it's like fallout with that

139
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,120
interesting that they good yeah cuz I

140
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,650
know you guys are gonna play with

141
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,050
marching I'm not gonna have fun and I

142
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,620
don't like the building aspect right

143
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,320
this is the

144
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,390
one of the aspects I'd liked at least to

145
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,130
engage in and the fallout 4 was the

146
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,770
building and this is you know you got to

147
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,170
do the building to enjoy it survival

148
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,180
games number one have not been really my

149
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,000
thing but I do love the world to fall

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,980
out so much so initially I was very

151
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,000
excited for it yeah upon playing it my

152
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,630
reactions are mixed at best it's gonna

153
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,960
be very friend driven but yeah if you've

154
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,970
got a bunch of friends I'm pretty sure

155
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,130
we fucked up that guy's experience by

156
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,500
ruining his house oh yeah this is what

157
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,960
that's what survival games are sucks you

158
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,340
know I saw people don't don't don't

159
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,740
don't believe that's how you get your

160
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,460
fun out of the game no but but really

161
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,570
how you would want to play it is

162
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,730
cooperatively to take down the different

163
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,980
monsters and stuff I guess in the game

164
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,790
yeah it feels like a lot like a lot of

165
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,120
reused assets and I don't really know if

166
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,700
it fits the Fallout universe very well I

167
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,400
would be here's what I would want in the

168
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,410
game like they have no NPCs if you

169
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,270
actually put a storyline in here you

170
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,760
throw some NPCs in and you give us

171
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,390
quests I'll be back and maybe they're

172
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,430
gonna get later on yeah maybe they'll

173
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,160
reconsider all that kind of stuff to

174
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,750
give a little bit more context but what

175
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,390
you would use it here now is cooperative

176
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,610
boss hunting and the PvP honestly is

177
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,720
kind of pathetic

178
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,430
not just from what I played that's not a

179
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,200
fair assessment I've watched other

180
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,170
people do PvP it's it's pretty bad it

181
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,390
takes I don't know it just doesn't seem

182
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,130
like setup for damn how a game that the

183
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,330
initiative was we want to have all the

184
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,000
humans be actual players or the NPC's be

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,330
actual humans and that was an initiative

186
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,700
to make them world feel more alive but

187
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,290
what it's actually done is make the

188
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,650
world feel much more empty you know cuz

189
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,210
people don't really play the way you

190
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,190
want them to play and so if you're

191
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,740
expecting humans to sort of roleplay

192
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,360
correctly this is not going to

193
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,370
all right anyway so that's our opinion

194
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,180
on the what we've played of fallout 76

195
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,100
and what we've seen others and their

196
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,690
experience or some friends that have

197
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,600
played it and Emilia mix that best

198
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,160
honestly so actually Jonah Micah just

199
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
like not four feet no I'm gonna go back

200
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,690
to read dead yeah I mean when there's

201
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,730
games like Red Dead out there

202
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,889
it did this right now this is really

203
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,190
tough yeah I go back to black out first
