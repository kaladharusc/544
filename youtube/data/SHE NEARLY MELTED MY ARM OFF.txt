at all the cool things in my office I

43
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,660
could show you something else all right

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,940
one of the benefits of having and

45
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,860
whatever a five-year long relationship

46
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,720
with Samsung is that they occasionally

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,550
send me their new gear before it comes

48
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,320
out this is not a sponsored video or

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,990
anything today is Wednesday I don't know

50
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,190
what the date is but they haven't even

51
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,590
announced the note 9 yet I've got two of

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,260
them thank you Samsung I will do the

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,570
notes my favorite phone bTW I will do a

54
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,340
proper review of this thing as soon as

55
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,220
they say this is I'm allowed to or

56
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,600
whatever or I have a chance to play with

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,480
it but mostly I just wanted to come on

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,550
here and mostly blue most I just wanted

59
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,700
to show you that I got it I was told not

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,120
to leave the office with it look very

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,890
exciting you can count on me to do a

62
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,470
full slightly biased review of this

63
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,640
thing as soon as I've had a chance to

64
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,620
really play with it they announced it

65
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,540
today so I just don't even know what's

66
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,510
new and what's different with it but

67
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,040
so Janice and I have been doing our

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,810
marriage counseling and going to a

69
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,050
therapist to always improve our marriage

70
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,170
and make sure you know we're being the

71
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,020
best spouses we can be and as the

72
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,470
husband of a to a pregnant wife one

73
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,640
thing I'm trying to be better as being

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,180
more empathetic so she just texted me

75
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,590
asking for chicken tacos and I'm being

76
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,210
good husband I'm going to get her

77
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,040

like it's like really old but it's not I

85
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,120

how it's all dumped looking right now I

88
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,340

Serge he was outside hey guys he was

90
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,490
outside with a mop and a bucket and the

91
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,170
bucket was filled up with dirty water

92
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,180
and he was painting the outside of his

93
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,310
sign trying to make it look like it was

94
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,980
like a New York institution when reality

95
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,990
he had just built it but now it's a

96
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,090
decade later and this place has become a

97
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,130

honey just because you don't know how to

126
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,930
drive it doesn't mean it's a stupid car

127
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,330
what I was sitting there and I didn't

128
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,830
even recognize the key was in the car

129
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,620
it's a key not in car maybe it just

130
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,450
doesn't maybe just doesn't agree with

131
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,820
you cuz it never does that for me so I

132
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,080
have to design in the Tesla I was gonna

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,430
do like a whole review is this gonna

134
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,330
spoil my review

135
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,040
no but there's there's one thing I

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,140
really do like okay the fact that it's

137
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,150
the greatest car ever meant one thing

138
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,330
when you when you push the brake and the

139
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,040
door closes for you that's actually

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,280
quite handy okay okay these sideview

141
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,370
mirrors they're so tiny it's like what

142
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,100
is the point of them I can't see

143
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,130
anything you just love to complain don't

144
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,800
you and I think you'll agree with me on

145
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,100
this you will no car is perfect

146
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,350
this grid leg pattern here when you're

147
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,300
driving in the sunlight yeah flecks on

148
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,950
to the windscreen when I let the

149
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,870
windscreen look at this it's all black

151
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,010
Drive West at the end of the day the Sun

this is all glass and the sun is shining

154
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,700
into my eyes yeah that thing where it's

155
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,130
like there's always an upside to

156
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,110
something you will have a ability to

157
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,030
always find a downside if I turn here
