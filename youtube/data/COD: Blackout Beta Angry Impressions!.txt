right there Wow I was staring at him and

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,150
I was like huh this guy didn't shoot me

77
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,400

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,840
literally the first time ever I'm

79

here faster bullets you know I can

107
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,370
understand if they want to put a faster

108
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,960
bullet upgrade if they call it say

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,370
something like I don't know muzzle

110
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,130
velocity is nothing but battlefield

111
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,370
fucking up call a high-velocity rounds

112
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,810
apparently they think we're too stupid

113
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,520
to understand high velocity and they

114
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:58,590
have just say faster bullets don't you

115
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,630
want faster bullets go Jim I think it

116
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,130
would be cool if we could kill each

117
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,650
other in this mode here like and then

118
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,539
just do a quick respawn you know enemy

119
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,690
is this that's that's just not as fun

120
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,539
you kind of get a little bit of practice

121
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:32,820

285
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:58,340
firefights going i got a sniper i'm

286

I'm gonna hold tab and then I'm gonna

292
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,920
pop these iron lungs and dead silence

293
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,160

349
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:15,180
like I like the weapons that I have and

350
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,730

351
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,190
although it's not kid it out so you just

352

361
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,900
he'll collapse a minute right there at

362
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,570
the window

363
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,550

364
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,670

382
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:46,850
[Music]

383
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,390
nice now I understand why people were

384
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,630
little dicted to these pop G type

385
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,970
fucking Battle Royale stuff yet that

386
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,929
communication that's what I love about

387
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,020
squad that's what I love about you know

388
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,410
post scriptum and that shit is really

389
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,910
important in these games

390
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,760
it feels military it feels tactical feel

391
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,890
strategic you're calling out areas we're

392
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,010
looting where you didn't utilizing our

393
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,669
advantages we have some knowledge of

394
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,480
what is coming I like it I like this

395
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
mode and that could just be battle

396
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,640
royale in general and and the fact that

397
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,179
I already liked the gameplay and gunplay

398
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,520
in Call of Duty Black Ops for

399
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,890
surprisingly in the beta so you're

400
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,890
mixing that with them with a popular

401
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:48,600
mode I can't lie it was fun no I didn't

402
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,720
get the last kill I think you got it I

403
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,830
pegged them with like only one one shot

404
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,630
on it and it was really slow at

405
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,669
reloading but I'm pretty sure it does a

406
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,850
lot of damage so it hurt him and then

407
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,169
you fit it up I hit him in the head with

408
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:08,669
a sniper oh wow that's overkill pari

409
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,720
pari green 509 thank you yeah he carried

410
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,700
me don't definitely carry me and I'm not

411
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,890
claiming otherwise I revived you four

412
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,520
times what I don't remember being

413
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,830
revived four times I remember being no

414
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,040
no that's in total that's nice yeah this

415
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,390
is like all in total all right well I

416
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,070
had a lot of fun with it man shit yes I

417
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,030
guess I like Battle Royale or at least I

418
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,130
understand the addiction of Battle

419
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,530
Royale and I already liked the gameplay

420
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,679
and gunplay here in Call of Duty in the

421
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,260
multiplayer so translating that over

422
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,140
into these little bits and bytes

423
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,080
my favorite part of military games is

424
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,269
calling out to each other direction

425
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,200
compass directions coordinates you know

426
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,549
working together then you add in looting

427
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:16,740
and you add in positioning it's great

428
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,320
formula great formula now Call of Duty's

429
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,690
obviously didn't create this it's just

430
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,940
emulating it it's just copying the other

431
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,409
games but it does add some entertainment

432
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,539
value and fun to this game that it

433
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,059
didn't otherwise have now I'm gonna back

434
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,059
out here to the main screen and what do

435
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,330
we have we have multiplayer zombies I

436
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,730
don't give a shit blackout is

437
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,559
essentially a free-to-play mode

438
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,519
oh boy although very very fun it's just

439
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,490
not a 60 player game but I fucking loved

440
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,720
it I love I got blackout I think it's a

441
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,100
$30 game if you love zombies and yeah

442
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,230
that definitely adds more value to it

443
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,320
but I'm definitely gonna review the game

444
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,210
there's no doubt about that and we'll

445
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,010
see how much fun I can squeeze out of

446
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,080
the multiplayer the zombies I think

447
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,639
there's multiple zombie mode this time

448
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,760
around there's like three total maybe

449
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,679
one of those will finally be fun for me

450
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,230
country so sick of zombies there's like

451
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,909
a Spartan one or something with a you

452
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,450
know like a shield and sword but uh I

453
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,889
really enjoyed the blackout beta so this

454
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,899
is crazy to me that I'm more excited for

455
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:35,100
Call of Duty this year than I am yeah

456
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,799
it's crazy I mean the only breaks my

457
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,809
heart was like 60 bucks breaks my heart

458
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:44,700
but i but I flipped here you know love

459
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,029
the guns the visuals very bright I

460
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,529
didn't expect tennis look at the turn

461
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,110
town the visuals but over time I like it

462
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,399
it pops pops fun exciting nice to look

463
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,840

464
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,610
direction because they saw a fortnight I

465
