1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,709
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,629
YouTube boogie2988 coming at your level

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,100
to get to the power of the Internet and

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,200
this is my weekly gaming news wrap-up so

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,450
let's just get right into the news so

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,040
we're about a month away from fallout 76

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
and I'm pretty excited to play this game

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,490
still but I have been very critical of

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,080
this game as to have many other people

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,119
the good news is a lot of youtubers a

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,130
lot of publications have invited out to

12
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,320
play this game there's hour-long to

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,269
hour-long playthroughs of this game you

14
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,039
can see on people's YouTube channel so

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,660
before you preorder this game before you

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,010
purchase this game you should definitely

17
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,470
watch some people play it I have and

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,360
I've got some thoughts about it this

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,559
pretty much uses the follow-up for

20
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,600
engine and it looks so close to fallout

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,460
4 that you will probably not be able to

22
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,950
distinguish gameplay right away until

23
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,090
you see certain mechanics they're only

24
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,370
exclusive in this particular game now

25
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,980
that said it's missing a lot of stuff

26
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,590
that fallout 4 had including in PCs and

27
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,899
things along that lines the only NPCs

28
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,890
are ever going to find are going to be

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,180
other players they're gonna be PCs

30
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,260
they're gonna be player characters not

31
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,750
non player characters but that is to say

32
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,460
there's still quite a bit of questing

33
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,410
and still quite a bit of stuff to do in

34
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,120
this game I was fairly surprised because

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,680
it seems like little every little camp

36
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,810
every little settlement has something to

37
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,490
explore and there's some pretty unique

38
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,530
stuff right around the spawn point the

39
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,490
the vault when you leave the vault

40
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,960
you're gonna find some pretty cool stuff

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,390
no spoilers but they did a good job of

42
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,189
making this game interesting and

43
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,720
playable I think if you prefer the

44
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,130
single-player fallout experience you

45
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,560
will probably enjoy this game a fair

46
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,119
amount but not as much as you would a

47
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,979
traditional game but there is a lot of

48
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,630
content a lot of stories a lot of

49
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,430
holotapes a lot of games and stuff to

50
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,560
play there are still goals and a lot of

51
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,270
monsters to fight there's still a lot of

52
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,220
content there and apparently a lot of

53
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,140
people who play this game said coming

54
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,909
across other people is actually fairly

55
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,310
rare unless you go into the game with a

56
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,840
lot of other people when you do meet

57
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,759
somebody else it tends to be interactive

58
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,710
and kind of fun and kind of silly and

59
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,979
not so greasy and miserable and awful so

60
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,810
I think that's kind of unique I'm kind

61
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,159
of interested in trying this game for

62
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,540
that alone Bethesda

63
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,979
still has not said how many people are

64
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,390
gonna be allowed on a particular server

65
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,700
at a particular time so your chances of

66
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,439
running into people it should be fairly

67
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,540
uncommon then when you come across their

68
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,680
settlement when you come across the

69
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,180
stuff they've built a lot of people say

70
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,710
it fills you with like a certain amount

71
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,119
of wonderment especially when they've

72
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,500
built in a place that you're used to

73
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,440
that's normally not got stuff there so I

74
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
I think that alone is intriguing to me

75
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
and but on top of that if you do have

76
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
friends on your friends list there are

77
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
obviously boss fights and things that

78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,470
you can do that do require multiple

79
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,270
people that I think is probably the most

80
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,860
intriguing thing being able to go in

81
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,270
with three or four friends and fight

82
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,650
some really big stuff and hopefully get

83
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,380
some really big rewards but who knows at

84
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,790
this point we still haven't played the

85
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,900
game so I don't know for sure but

86
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,580
everything I have seen so far

87
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,590
keeps telling me that this game is not

88
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,970
as bad as I originally anticipated

89
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,370
though not as good as a traditional

90
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,290
fallout entry would be all that said I'm

91
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,520
definitely planning to stream this game

92
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,820
I might even do the unthinkable which is

93
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,440
preorder it so I think it'd get in on

94
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,480
the stress test this weekend or the beta

95
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,190
before this game goes live so I can show

96
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,690
you guys footage so you can watch me

97
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,040
playing on stream and you can make an

98
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,960
informed decision let me know is this a

99
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
game you're interested in have you given

100
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
up on this game have you watched some of

101
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,920
the footage let me know in the comment

102
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,850
section below because I'm really

103
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,350
interested in finding out how you guys

104
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,170
feel about fallout 76 I still don't know

105
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,290
I'm hesitantly hopeful now this week's

106
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,300
video was sponsored by the folks over at

107
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,740
Verve and if you want to help me out and

108
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,550
support me go to Verve Co /bo o gie and

109
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,560
download the Verve app right now now the

110
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,030
reason I continue to recommend Verve is

111
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,770
because it is a perfect place to watch a

112
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,870
tremendous library of great

113
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,250
entertainment whether it's a podcast

114
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,530
like critical role or harmontown or you

115
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,209
want to watch some Naruto's some one

116
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,310
piece some attack on Titan it's all

117
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,739
available under one roof right here at

118
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,900
Verve I personally have been watching a

119
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,190
lot of the NYX plat cartoons and I

120
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,840
highly recommend that you do if you

121
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
missed out on that stuff growing up

122
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,590
those 90's cartoons there's nothing like

123
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,000
them you should check them out on Verve

124
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,040
all you got to do is go to Verve dot ce

125
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
o /b oo gie download the app and when

126
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,190
you do you'll get a 30-day ad free trial

127
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,720
of premium and you'll be supporting me

128
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
at the same time so I really hope you do

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
go watch some cool stuff when you're

130
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,340
done with this video then another news

131
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,709
Super Mario Party 11 came out this is

132
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,060
basically Super Mario Party for the

133
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,550
switch with a Metacritic score of 77 by

134
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,890
the critics and 7.2 for the user score

135
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,900
and I have to say that feels about right

136
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,120
this is probably one of the best mario

137
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,370
super mario parties in several

138
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,870
generations I think the Wii version was

139
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,160
not very good the Wii U version was

140
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,500
terrible most of the 3ds games I really

141
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,930
did enjoy this is probably the best that

142
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,610
it's been for a while that is to say

143
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,830
it's still not great it's kind of

144
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,360
shallow there's not a lot of gameplay

145
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,669
there's not a lot of minigames there's a

146
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,289
lot of stuff to do there but it was

147
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,669
still destroys friendships with the

148
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,319
bonus stars and everything else but at

149
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,240
the end of the day I don't know it's it

150
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,620
was worth playing and I'm glad I picked

151
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,360
it up I don't know that I recommend it

152
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,719
yet

153
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,520
I'd say wait till it goes on sell but

154
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,930
it's a Nintendo game they never go on

155
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,370
sale so good luck with that

156
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,710
pod worth renting though one other piece

157
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,479
of news here by the way I familiar with

158
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,490
obsidian entertainment because you might

159
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,110
have played fallout new vegas or pillars

160
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,430
of return of the era pillars of eternity

161
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,439
to Star Wars Knight of the Old Republic

162
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,469
South Park the stick of truth or so many

163
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,629
other amazing games well it looks like

164
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,849
Microsoft is acquiring that company and

165
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,590
in fact people have said the deal is all

166
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,289
about 90% done it should be announced as

167
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,900
official very very soon now this could

168
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,099
turn out to be a really good thing

169
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,379
because Microsoft is going into a next

170
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,729
console generation and maybe there'll be

171
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,979
a couple of obsidian games leading that

172
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,440
generation some really good RPG may be

173
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,629
as good as fable was treated back in the

174
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,060
day the downside is Microsoft does tend

175
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,590
to purchase companies like this and then

176
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,629
change them and and irrevocably destroy

177
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,039
them and pull them in completely apart

178
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,590
and then bury them and and use their IP

179
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,029
to make terrible Kinect games

180
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,729
please don't that happen with obsidian

181
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,060
obsidian is too good to do that to then

182
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,729
again so is rare

183
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,289
Microsoft please don't mess this one up

184
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,060
please

185
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,460
so the CEO over at Sony and PlayStation

186
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,319
has basically confirmed they are working

187
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,539
on the PlayStation 5 now this is kind of

188
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,800
obvious when you've finished the

189
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,810
PlayStation 4 you start working on the

190
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,610
PlayStation 5 when you finish the Xbox

191
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,759
one you start working on the Xbox 2 I

192
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,139
mean that's kind of obvious but it is

193
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,580
nice to see them talking about it

194
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,719
because if they're talking about it now

195
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:05,099
that probably means we're gonna get a

196
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,560
lot of information in next year's e3 my

197
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,150
biggest guess is that it's going to come

198
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,060
out in 2020 not 2019 but who knows they

199
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,740
might surprise this by maybe trying to

200
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,110
rush to market but the CEO of Sony

201
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,490
basically said they were working on a

202
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,830
Playstation 4 successor did not call the

203
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,419
PlayStation 5 though he did say at this

204
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,639
point what I can say is it's necessary

205
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,069
to have a next-generation hardware so

206
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,259
there's there's really not much here now

207
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,250
if you're somebody that feels like this

208
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,110
is way too soon you got to keep in mind

209
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,050
the CEO of Sony an interactive

210
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,669
entertainment John Code era already said

211
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,349
that the PlayStation 4 is entering the

212
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,270
final stage of its life cycle and he

213
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,589
kind of hinted that this may not happen

214
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:40,980
until

215
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,160
20:21 he did say we will use the next

216
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,810
three years to prepare the next step to

217
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,070
crouch it down so that we can jump

218
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,440
higher into the future so maybe I'm

219
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,940
wrong maybe it won't be 2020 maybe

220
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,650
that's one will get the e3 information

221
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,990
and all of this could be more about

222
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,180
playing tricks on Microsoft than it is

223
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,920
anything else I mean talking about this

224
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,690
publicly certainly could be a PR move

225
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,340
getting people prepared for the end of

226
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,930
the PlayStation life cycle getting them

227
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,980
excited about the next one but it could

228
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,200
also be manipulating Microsoft into

229
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,120
rushing the market and releasing a less

230
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
powerful console maybe too early to try

231
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,260
to jump the gun who really knows at this

232
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,580
point but here's the thing Microsoft

233
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,630
kind of has their head in the clouds

234
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,210
Microsoft has announced project X cloud

235
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,520
which is basically cloud gaming and we

236
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,750
know that Google's already been working

237
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,400
on that we know that PlayStation has

238
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,380
kind of perfected that with Playstation

239
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,880
now even though that's kind of a failed

240
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,160
service but Xbox definitely is looking

241
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,680
at cloud gaming something extreme Xbox

242
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,410
games like Halo to your PC to your phone

243
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,960
to your tablet to any device regardless

244
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,150
of platform and we know a lot of people

245
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,800
are playing Fortnight and pub G on

246
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
mobiles so maybe maybe we're finally

247
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,660
there I hope that's not the cornerstone

248
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,250
of the next Xbox console or the

249
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,890
PlayStation console at the same time but

250
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,270
who knows at the at the end of the day

251
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,340
that may be where this is moving I just

252
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,050
don't think Internet is good enough here

253
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,300
in the United States or worldwide I just

254
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,370
wonder if that's a smart decision but we

255
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,720
do know that mobile gaming is the future

256
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,350
across the world and I mean maybe maybe

257
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,970
there's a switch in the PlayStation

258
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,440
future maybe there's a Nintendo switch

259
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,660
for the Xbox in the future could you

260
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,460
imagine a portable Xbox console the uses

261
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,230
cloud computing could get into that and

262
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,270
then finally I think it looks like it's

263
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,190
all booked confirmed that there will be

264
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,710
new Nintendo switch hardware with some

265
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,140
minor upgrades and improvements most

266
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,880
notably people who say they're they're

267
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,930
in the know distributors and

268
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,700
manufacturers are saying that a Nintendo

269
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,830
switch will have a better version with a

270
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,840
better screen next year probably not an

271
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,390
OLED screen but a slightly more improved

272
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,340
screen I but I think that's not the only

273
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,050
reason they're revising the hardware if

274
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,880
you guys remember people found a back

275
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,040
door in the Tegra chip that runs the

276
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,169
Nintendo switch people are allowed to do

277
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,700
home brewing and hacking and do pretty

278
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,320
much whatever they want to do with or

279
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,060
Nintendo switch a new version of the

280
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,800
Nintendo switch will probably fix that

281
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,930
Hardware loophole so I think moving

282
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,400
forward you will not be able to hack us

283
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,610
with

284
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,260
so if you're thinking about purchasing a

285
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,519
switch and you want to be able to maybe

286
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,380
hack it one day you want to be able to

287
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,600
do homebrew or put your own games on it

288
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,459
you probably should purchase one of this

289
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,930
models you're just looking for a better

290
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,790
screening you plan to wait waiting one

291
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,899
more year for the new version to get

292
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,519
announced and come out probably not a

293
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,380
bad decision but this is what Nintendo

294
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,060
does they basically try to sell you the

295
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,350
same hardware over and over and over

296
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,390
again by improving it of course

297
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,920
PlayStation and Xbox that this

298
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,019
generation - I bought so many

299
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,910
Playstations there's so many Xbox is it

300
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,019
only makes sense that I buy another

301
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,640
switch alright that's going to do it for

302
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,170
this week's gaming news roundup I hope

303
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,209
you enjoy these videos sometimes I think

304
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:28,680
some of these articles should be just

305
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,450
individual pieces but then again the

306
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,769
video turns out to be like three minutes

307
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,300
long I think it's cooler to do it all in

308
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,279
one big wrap-up especially if you guys

309
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,360
