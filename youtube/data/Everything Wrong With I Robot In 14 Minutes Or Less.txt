1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,580
reading Oh lots of reading and legalese

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,360
reading at that

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,889
honestly all this robot law reading

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,940
bullshit might as well just be

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,080
production logos that's how much

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,550
attention I'm paying it also all these

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,560
laws seem to only revolve around bodily

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,300
harm or death to humans and nothing else

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,310
maybe Isaac Asimov watched the purge and

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,110
Futurama back to back I'm not sure but

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,460
you think he put something else in there

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,329
regarding ethics

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,250
God gave us humans ten laws and only one

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,599
of them was don't hurt each other name

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,529
character wakes up from a nightmare

16
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,110
cliche incorrectly eating pie also it's

17
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,309
alarming how easily this movie is

18
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,600
opening few minutes of Will Smith doing

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,190
could substitute for the opening few

20
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,600
minutes Will Smith doing bid and I am

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
Legend alarming I tells you also

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,260
showering without a shower curtain how

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,760
does anything stay dry in that bathroom

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800
into hell out in my face can you can

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,390
hate robots that's fine but don't you

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,250
want your package honestly like let's be

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,720
truthful with each other here that hat

28
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,220
is the worst thing about this movie and

29
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,020
yes I know the movie is a giant turd

30
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,930
that's how bad that hat is excuse me so

31
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,460
main characters disdain for robots

32
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,410
absolutely hammered home by the 4-minute

33
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,390
mark if you've come for subtlety oh hell

34
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,579
no also if the robots have all the jobs

35
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,840
what's the unemployment rate like in

36
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,540
2035 closing in on 50% goddamnit young

37
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,920
Shia LeBeouf dragged this movie into him

38
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,140
did he stop cussing cuz you're not good

39
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,090
at it that's for sure but still he said

40
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,800
let me borrow your damn ass keys which

41
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,570
is more an assault on basic grammar than

42
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,190
it is an assault on cussing actually he

43
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,780
barely even cussed whatever I already

44
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,409
hate this movie

45
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,970
thanks going movie at the beginning of

46
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,350
Spooner's sneaky crawl he's only at the

47
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,880
second opening in the hallway but as

48
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,340
soon as Gigi says you talk to Marcy he

49
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,299
makes it all the way to the stairs

50
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,010
making Spooner the fastest stealth

51
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,900
crawler in the world congratulations

52
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,510
when I was coming up we didn't just

53
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,420
marry someone then divorce them then not

54
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,850
talk to them uh old granny you're as

55
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,520
stuffed with x position as you are old

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,840
potato pie why the hell does he keep

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,430
eating pie like this I don't know I

58
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,689
don't live in the future but isn't

59
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,130
assuming a running robot carrying a

60
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,659
purse is a thief kind of a huge leap in

61
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,280
logic

62
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
stop this robot is violating the second

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
law you've already forgotten the laws

64
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
you say me too this is a long-ass

65
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,930
parking garage I think it's about time

66
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,700
we recognized Will Smith's Tom Cruise

67
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,380
likability to run in most of his movies

68
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,480
men in black man in black - I am Legend

69
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,759
iRobot bad boys bad boys - and he made

70
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,750
the state Hancock Suicide Squad you

71
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,740
alright

72
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,270
character development via eyewitnesses

73
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,160
but since she's right I'm mostly ok with

74
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,410
this he is an asshole how many robots if

75
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,120
ever / - first to be fair snatching a

76
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
purse is not in violation of any of the

77
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
laws theft isn't technically harmful and

78
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,860
when you're a robot everything is

79
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,570
technical discounts Dark Tower Khalifa

80
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm sorry my responses are limited you

81
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,250
must ask the right question dr. Lanning

82
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,840
programmed his response hologram to be

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,610
just ambiguous enough to move the plot

84
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,170
forward just a little bit during each

85
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,580
interaction because nothing makes a

86
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,989
movie more interesting than a scavenger

87
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,030
hunt why would you kill yourself that

88
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,310
Detective it's the right question yet we

89
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,930
still don't receive an answer program

90
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,530
terminated

91
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,660
how and why did you record a program of

92
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,100
your future interaction with a detective

93
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,420
investigating your death before I'll

94
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,130
forget it this movie's IMDB score is low

95
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,180
enough I bet I can fake my way through

96
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,049
this genre for the coffee sugar ah oh

97
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,459
you thought I was calling you sugar

98
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,290
ladies and gentlemen comedy uh maybe you

99
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,640
simply would have banned the internet to

100
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,260
keep the libraries open you mother

101
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,299
fuckers closed the library's monsters

102
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,739
that's the most fucked up thing in this

103
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,180
entire movie lawrence told me to

104
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,440
accommodate you in any way possible

105
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,510
really being pretty rapey

106
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,920
little-known fact tom brady left

107
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
girlfriend and baby mama Bridget

108
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,190
Moynahan for Gisele because of how bad

109
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,049
this movie turned out true story Danny

110
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,750
Amendola told me apologies there appears

111
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,880
to be data corruption so no video of the

112
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,140
suicide murder great

113
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,790
might as well be set in the 50s based on

114
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,200
the evidence he has to go on also

115
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Spooner who has been overly suspicious

116
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,890
of everything thus far glosses over the

117
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,209
data corruption excuse without any

118
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,650
further questioning or investigating

119
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,510
every time he puts on the Hat this

120
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,130
mother takes the extra time to ensure

121
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,140
the left side is covering 30% of his ear

122
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,610
and it's maybe the most annoying thing

123
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,000
ever

124
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,010
not having vertigo not these laws

125
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,260
they're hardwired into every robot how

126
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,030
are they hardwired exactly are there

127
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,769
three separate first second and third

128
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,870
law wires that are installed a robot can

129
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,340
no more commit murder than a human could

130
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,620
walk on water you know there was this

131
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,340
one guy

132
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,110
stealing the if he's not guilty why did

133
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,489
he run motive from every episode of

134
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,890
Matlock ever holy robots constructed to

135
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,540
serve coffee and B Butler's were also

136
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,430
constructed to survive 18 story jumps

137
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,000
and mostly I'm just asking why he got

138
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,370
down here that fast King no not bloody

139
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,760
likely

140
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,010
Jesus thank God he hit the whatever with

141
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,389
his bullet that conveniently drips out

142
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,100
liquid mercury one drop at a time so he

143
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
could track this thing I mean imagine if

144
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,400
that hadn't happened you've heard it

145
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,770
badly badly is an adverb meaning that

146
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,270
the method Will Smith used to hurt the

147
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,919
robot was poor when what you mean to say

148
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,720
is that the robots wounds are severe do

149
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
you see me on the phone all the more

150
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,580
reason you shouldn't be driving

151
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,780
audible skidding sounds from a hovering

152
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,300
car so where is everybody this facility

153
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,220
was designed built and it's operated

154
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
mechanically so are you the first humans

155
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,490
ever to set foot here

156
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,080
where are the checks and balances people

157
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,639
I want to trust robots as much as the

158
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,290
next guy but I can't do that as long as

159
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,580
I know you're letting them run this free

160
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,680
I give robots super-strength you're just

161
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,090
asking for an army of passionless

162
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,860
creatures that can't be defeated all of

163
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,300
those swamp team bullets managed to miss

164
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,490
insert stormtrooper joke here all those

165
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,870
bullets and you simply needed to think

166
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,460
like spider-man to bring him down what

167
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,990
if I'm right after several minutes of

168
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,430
the boss explaining how stupidest theory

169
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,260
was this guy still changes set bosses

170
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,030
mind with a simple one if I'm right if

171
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,350
everyone believes that this robot

172
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,000
doesn't have the capacity to kill then I

173
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,710
guess these six guards are actually just

174
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,419
an acapella group or something my father

175
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,850
tried to teach me human emotions they

176
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,830
are difficult I'm going to choose this

177
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,510
moment here among many to praise Alan

178
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,740
Tariq for his performance in this film

179
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,870
as the robot and we'll take two sins off

180
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,310
a movie I know we'll go on to earn

181
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,020
enough for that to sin reduction to not

182
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,610
affect the ultimate score but still show

183
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,200
respect for an actor who is great can a

184
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,270
robot write a symphony probably yeah

185
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,220
maybe even a kick-ass one I think maybe

186
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,810
your anti robot prejudice is making you

187
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,510
stay some stupid haha super tiny cell

188
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,250
phones of the future imagine struggling

189
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,150
to tell the difference between your

190
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,710
phone and your flash drive that's the

191
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,479
future there isn't some hard kill switch

192
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,340
on these robots even data on Star Trek

193
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,930
had an off button meanwhile at the

194
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,940
Ovaltine kept wait hopeful teen cafe

195
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,770
what the fuck you want to call your

196
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,870
grandmother because I will you know how

197
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,430
cop bosses talk to their detectives

198
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,580
turtle 4650 inflation demolition

199
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,560
scheduled for 8 a.m. Spooner doesn't

200
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,700
question why this is going to be

201
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,289
demolished it's a large mansion still

202
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,700
fully furnished and contains dr.

203
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,500
landings personal materials and possibly

204
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,510
very useful information yet USR is going

205
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,890
to destroy it and no one's going to

206
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,889
worry about it

207
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,080
detective spoon spooner still has access

208
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,729
to landing channels for some reason I've

209
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,129
always been ghosts in the machine roll

210
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:16,610
croteau

211
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,669
wait wrong movie stored bait it will

212
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,139
smith learn nothing of the usefulness of

213
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,759
cats from his time on men in black this

214
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,199
cat somehow doesn't scratch off Will

215
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,279
Smith's face during the sequence

216
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,900
suggesting the movie has never cat it

217
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,039
this thing just broke through the

218
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,900
hallway window upstairs at a good forty

219
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,610
feet from here not only do I not think

220
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,020
it can move fast enough to be here right

221
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,490
now it also seems to be destroying the

222
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,020
house based on what room Will Smith is

223
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,330
it which is absurd also he survives this

224
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,860
and everything else that happens in this

225
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,090
scene which is some astronomical

226
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,180
bullshit like this for example I mean

227
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,069
did you see that even the cat is James

228
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,779
Bond right now Jesus the English

229
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,219
language has no words for how much this

230
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:49,699
pissed me off

231
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:51,919
therefore I will resort to French shakin

232
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,689
City as said it will bless their cool

233
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,719
slow Jack gets it that Connery also most

234
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,000
convenient mote bond ever also this cat

235
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,680
just went through all that and then got

236
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,210
dunked underwater and still has not

237
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,650
clawed out even a single one Will

238
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,599
Smith's eyes also this cat was

239
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,069
definitely covered in water for the sake

240
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,539
of this scene which if you know cats

241
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,189
basically qualifies as animal torture

242
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,080
but as long as no horses were harmed in

243
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,249
the making of this movie I guess we

244
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,069
don't care how does he know where she

245
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,110
lives what happened to you Calvin says

246
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,610
this instead of why are you at my house

247
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,839
we just met this morning and I don't

248
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,610
like it he postulated that every

249
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,020
conversation between these two goes like

250
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,969
this Spooner asks a specific question

251
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,560
Calvin gives Spooner a ridiculously

252
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,479
complicated answer Spooner goes what and

253
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,370
Calvin scoffs and says it normally they

254
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,689
do this because she's a smart person

255
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,279
he's a dumb person and run-time

256
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,129
suggested that robots might naturally

257
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,349
evolve awesome you still went through

258
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,479
with making him look you want something

259
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,699
to be wrong with them this is a personal

260
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:44,330
vendetta

261
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,129
maybe but as a woman of science that

262
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,599
shouldn't matter he has evidence enough

263
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,159
to form a hypothesis just let him work

264
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,819
it out yep you are the dumbest smart

265
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,879
person I have ever met in my life well

266
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,560
you've clearly never met Kristen I mean

267
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,810
me Chris will be mad if I make that joke

268
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,430
about him but I'm concerned it's not

269
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,719
funny enough if I make it about me

270
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:05,240
maybe Barret ah Will Smith makes

271
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,680
pretending to drink whiskey look like an

272
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,389
impossible task if robots aren't

273
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:09,710
supposed to have emotions then why does

274
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,479
this one look so sad yes hello I'd like

275
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,310
to report a complaint regarding my ns5

276
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,930
it keeps giving me seductive looks while

277
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,610
it chops phallic vegetables future

278
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,870
security systems don't need your

279
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,519
fingerprint or your eye scan just the

280
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,839
butt end of a balled up fist

281
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,009
somehow

282
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,589
u.s. our mainframe accessing mainframes

283
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,999
and doing general detective work while

284
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,409
driving at a high rate of speed it's

285
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:28,460
convenient that there are no other

286
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,779
drivers on this interstate that runs

287
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,520
through urban Chicago so these giant

288
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,659
robot truck could attack in this

289
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,930
formation oh hell no it's not a Will

290
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,550
Smith movie if he doesn't say aw hell no

291
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,110
or I mean damn you think that they'd

292
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,579
come up with a less expensive way to try

293
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,169
and kill Spooner but it seems like they

294
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,310
went with the most expensive way

295
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,779
thankfully for the viewer whenever a

296
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,279
robot has turned evil in this movie his

297
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,870
chest glows red instead of blue and

298
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,519
while the movie has no explanation for

299
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,899
that mine is quite simple the movie

300
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,190
sucks balls and thinks the viewers are

301
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,440
all morons not only is this car spin at

302
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,060
high speed problematic in the world of

303
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,040
logic it also somehow doesn't result in

304
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,930
all the robots flying off which is even

305
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,699
more problematic yeah he's totally

306
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,170
passed down after these excessive

307
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,120
g-forces no question about it except for

308
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,470
the movie totally glossing over it and

309
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,399
keeping him coherent well he's not a

310
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,959
robot and is the main character so I

311
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,519
guess he survives this even though

312
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,920
that's anger inducing levels of bull I

313
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,190
just threw up and that's the sin holy Sh

314
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,779
he's one of them he's one of them and by

315
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,490
that I mean most predictable thing ever

316
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,190
sunny has the Three Laws but he can

317
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,560
choose not to obey them sounds kind of

318
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,149
like the Three Laws don't mean doesn't

319
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,860
it play I guess in the future it's not

320
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,300
rude just to walk into someone's house

321
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,160
and play with her stereo okay he has a

322
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,990
robot arm and that's all great still

323
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,639
doesn't explain his unhinged hatred of

324
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,500
robots or how he was able to spray paint

325
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,029
his arm back together but whatever I'm

326
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,910
wild by your side - movie Sarah this was

327
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,300
hers

328
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,980
so you kept and are wearing the necklace

329
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,480
of one of the victims of the car crash

330
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,190
that cost you your arm yeah that's

331
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,730
normal

332
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,019
Jesus how did you even get this without

333
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:58,279
stealing it from the morgue so Will

334
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,630
Smith's character hates robots because

335
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,949
they saved him instead of the little

336
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,720
girl fine I understand that motivation

337
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,339
but my question is why did that robot

338
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,440
save him instead of the girl well I know

339
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,560
what they say about old dogs no not

340
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,069
really

341
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,350
right this society has autonomous robots

342
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,209
but hasn't downloaded basic Wikipedia

343
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:15,529
knowledge into their brain so they can

344
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,660
understand idioms right I had hoped you

345
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,160
would come to think of me as your friend

346
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,870
even though the last interaction they

347
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,490
had sunny tried to kill him he's still

348
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,930
an optimist his name is sunny for

349
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,370
Christ's sake

350
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,110
I'm sorry I'm allergic to bullshit hey

351
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,370
asshole that's my line

352
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,350
I'm so sorry Sonny what are you sorry

353
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,240
about his recent malfunctioning Jesus

354
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,490
movie these are robots and 95% of humans

355
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,440
would not get attached to them lit hurt

356
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,300
why did these humans program this robot

357
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,190
with the concept of pain why the who are

358
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,720
you wearing sunglasses it's a nighttime

359
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,630
dude why is it that when robots are

360
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,970
stored in an empty space they will group

361
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,920
together rather than stand alone why are

362
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
they all still on and how did they not

363
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,010
run out of power in those crates the

364
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,630
three laws apparently led to robot chaos

365
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,970
fine but why did said robot chaos begin

366
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,110
without warning and evolved within

367
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,550
minutes into a scene out of gangs of New

368
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,410
York upon seeing a single human these

369
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,850
robots stopped beating up other robots

370
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,230
and collectively chase said human

371
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,120
because reasons why were they beating up

372
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,650
other robots just before this only to

373
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,150
shift into human hating mode on a dime

374
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,710
do they no longer want to be robot ass

375
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,370
as well oh I see half the reject

376
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,840
homeless robots still value human life

377
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,340
while the other half of the ball to

378
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,960
rightfully hate human life do I have

379
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,250
that right why does the three laws

380
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,320
programming only affect infect half the

381
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,330
robot population and reluctantly Bridget

382
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,860
Moynahan signed the divorce papers I

383
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,450
mean contract knowing it contained and

384
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,160
Exploited of steamy shower scene not

385
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
gonna lie totally forgot Shia was in

386
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
this that's how unimportant his

387
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,750
character is instead of completely wind

388
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,370
blocking or rip breaking this asshole

389
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,020
this robot just punched merely throws

390
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,850
him back 15 yards and causes him to make

391
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,770
a concern facial expression wait when we

392
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,510
last left her she was half naked coming

393
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,680
out of the shower and realizing her

394
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,970
personal robot was going to kill her now

395
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,310
we cut to this the cabin in between this

396
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,900
crowd of stupid humans marching on the

397
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,730
robots has seen V for Vendetta one too

398
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,330
many times

399
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,280
stupid humans forever somehow gets to be

400
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,930
the leader of the impossibly colossal

401
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,330
Chicago Tea mob hasn't that boy lesson

402
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,500
Spooner runs into one of the three

403
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,020
people he knows during the robot riot

404
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,560
some bullsh

405
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,970
this chick fires this machine gun like

406
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,950
this and somehow only hits the bad robot

407
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,900
which is actually preposterous did you

408
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,060
just shoot at me with guys close well I

409
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,190
worked in it here's some more ridiculous

410
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,720
results-oriented thinking just because

411
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,130
it work does not mean it wasn't a

412
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,900
stupidest fucking hell decision sudden

413
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,370
trapdoor entrances both completely out

414
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,020
of nowhere and out of the sight line of

415
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,670
the red robot and a huge fucking ex

416
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,220
machina service areas no surveillance

417
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,050
because why would we ever want to keep

418
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,670
tabs on those servicing our super

419
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,850
high-tech robot lab building 2880 stats

420
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,530
detective movie is telling me they

421
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,880
walked up all those steps without even

422
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,470
being slightly winded or sweaty are we

423
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,670
sure they aren't all robots

424
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,200
this thing's basically the metal baby

425
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,180
face from Matrix Revolutions I would

426
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,320
prefer not to kill dr. Calvin yep this

427
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,790
robot is still human it picked up and

428
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,170
assimilated the wink when your lying

429
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,970
thing from 7th grade kids interactions

430
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,470
Spooner in the gang are able to move

431
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,940
freely in the US our headquarters

432
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,740
despite Vicky's omnipotence just don't

433
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,480
look down don't look down that's for

434
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,340
building planning he's right but that

435
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,330
doesn't mean I'm not gonna send this

436
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,960
movie for this building's poor planning

437
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,520
this works for some reason thank you for

438
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,080
this vertigo-inducing camera swoop guy

439
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,610
who will clearly go on to direct or at

440
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,560
least inspire a ninja turtles movie this

441
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,450
is awesome but why is sunny so much

442
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,740
better fighting than the other robots

443
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,540
again with the Vertigo camera twirl

444
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,370
Jesus Alex Proyas you make good movies

445
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,320
once upon a time got you so obsessed

446
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,970
with a swirly camera because it's

447
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,040
annoying will you make sure dr. Calvin

448
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,510
devolves into Mary Jane Watson by the

449
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,520
finale um what is this glowing center

450
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,870
pillar made of and why can he kind of

451
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,490
grab it and slow his descent and what

452
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,720
does it made of and why does this movie

453
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,610
hate me think that's what dr. Lanning

454
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,200
would have wanted oh the landing who

455
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,850
created a supercomputer that instigated

456
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,680
a robot uprising and killed himself thus

457
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
avoiding any moral or legal fallout from

458
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,550
that you know apocalypse scenario yet

459
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,010
planning and sunny became robot Jesus to

460
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,720
the other robots and he saw that it was

461
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,140
good

462
00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:02,120
just what do you think you're doing day

463
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,010
there is a robot in this formation that

464
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,279
does not belong identify it

465
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:19,070
