1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,820
barely Pirates have overthrown

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,380
Cinderella's Kingdom and have commenced

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,520
with the traditional Friday night

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,500
fireworks you should we send them for 46

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,150
seconds of logos at this point I would

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,029
have known how long was up there

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,980
underwater anyway and what luck two

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,510
random fishermen come along and catch

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,770
him in their net if they hadn't come by

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,030
when they did he probably only would

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,560
have had another 24 hours underwater

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,190
before he died not to be confused with

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,379
Cadiz Kentucky wait there is a good to

14
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:35,199
use Kentucky Wow your majesty

15
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,269
go him up in a fishing net if you got a

16
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:38,829
man a fishing net explain why your

17
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,010
wetter than he is no I told you one side

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,379
alone died 200 years ago expositional

19
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,260
arguing his Fountain of Youth why is the

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,999
name of this movie on Stranger Tides and

21
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,469
not the Fountain of Youth in case you

22
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:51,760
can be used it with London glitter I

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,289
guess the movie expects the shot of

24
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,940
money changing hands to explain away the

25
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,109
fact that Jack Sparrow is currently

26
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,699
posing as a judge but a lot more

27
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:58,989
information is needed for this to make

28
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,789
any sense - Jack arrived in London with

29
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,229
gobs of cash to pay off all the guards

30
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,309
and all the lawyers that would

31
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,110
presumably be an obstacle for posing as

32
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,310
judge wouldn't ever be at least one

33
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,930
incorruptible person who would keep Jack

34
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,790
from posing as a judge and on top of all

35
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,000
that

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,620
how does no one recognize that doesn't

37
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,120
remotely sound or look like the actual

38
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,010
judge yeah the woman you're finding

39
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,410
guilty verdict means he'll hang does the

40
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,640
phone and just get to unilaterally

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,050
decide the verdict without any

42
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,240
deliberation with the jury also why does

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
a jury even exist in this trial he

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,470
arranged to transport this prisoner to

45
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,450
the Tower of London jack had enough cash

46
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,040
on him to pay off all these people so he

47
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,480
could be a judge why didn't you just pay

48
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,830
people off so he and Gibbs could escape

49
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,930
without all the fanfare last I heard you

50
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,000
had held offense find the sounds from

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,770
the view you mean the object of Seiler

52
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,180
folklore the two sailors from the

53
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,530
previous scene made a significant

54
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,390
discovery about how convenient not at

55
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,920
this double-cross take place did this

56
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,330
driver go to somebody in the British

57
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,590
government and say hey Jack Sparrow is

58
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,909
going to make a daring escape with his

59
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,650
buddy gets but if you pay me more money

60
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,420
than he did I'll deliver him to you

61
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,890
instead why not just pay the driver

62
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,510
money for the information and stop Jack

63
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,280
Sparrow before he makes the escape will

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,690
you waste time on Jack trying to eat a

65
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,190
pastry while being chained to a gold

66
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,950
chair

67
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,440
so both someone up please remove these

68
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,560
insan okay you can persuade your captors

69
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,910
to remove your chains if you're annoying

70
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,710
enough and also even though they know

71
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,360
the legend of Jack Sparrow they've never

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,450
heard about his many many escapes wreak

73
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,480
havoc that's racist you do know the way

74
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
to the fountain you could guide an

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,930
expedition they still want him to guide

76
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,400
the expedition even though he lost the

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,730
map and he's a pirate and a captain why

78
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,140
put Barbosa in the room when you can

79
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,210
dramatically reveal him also Barbosa

80
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,440
could have cleared up this is this the

81
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
real Jack Sparrow argument within

82
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,960
seconds but we had to sit through two

83
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,730
minutes of that nonsense anyway are

84
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,990
those his qualifications for being the

85
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,070
captain of the kingship our

86
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,960
communication skills previous sailing

87
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,430
experience and being in all the other

88
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,320
movies a little rewarded with the high

89
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,020
station sodas ah I can't tell if this

90
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,490
overacting is getting worse as the scene

91
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,750
progresses or if I'm just getting more

92
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,370
annoyed by it jack is not immediately

93
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,750
shot right after tapping both these

94
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,000
guards in the nuts also escaping via nut

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,770
tap and then the King's Guard escorted

96
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:06,209
by a plate pastries you movie who

97
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,590
choreographed this escape Rube Goldberg

98
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,390
this guard has a gun but still opts for

99
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,950
a brisk run down the stairs instead of

100
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,780
shooting also I realize we can't see

101
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,670
jack but why couldn't they see jack he's

102
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,870
hiding behind the table if you're facing

103
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,280
the table but if you're running towards

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,810
the left side Jack is just crouching

105
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,310
behind it in plain view I'm honestly

106
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,840
surprised Rob Marshall didn't just walk

107
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,670
in and hand Jack a sword ago this

108
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,350
electrical outlet and this electrical

109
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,989
outlet and this HVAC vent a few things

110
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,850
it takes Jack absolutely no time to get

111
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,440
to this position this rope designed to

112
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
hold these banners of fabric is not only

113
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,310
holding up a 175-pound man but it's not

114
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,360
even tightening with the additional

115
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,520
weight also no one down below sees Jack

116
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,810
and alerts the guards who are searching

117
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,850
for him those late 17th century London

118
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,230
have a strict no snitching policy I'm

119
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,820
unaware of this tassel conveniently

120
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,380
breaks at the very last second so we can

121
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,030
continue this cartoonish J scene that

122
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,350
will inevitably end with Jack getting

123
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,390
away fantastic plan let's cut the rope

124
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,130
so he can swing down to his escape so

125
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,390
the guards can chase him in the street

126
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,590
instead of standing under him in the

127
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,030
streets so he has nowhere to go I'm

128
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,920
gonna rename Jack Sparrow Tony Jack

129
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,350
Sparrow oh man he dragged Dean judi

130
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,660
dench into this didn't think okay why

131
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,860
get on the top of this carriage where

132
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,330
you can be seen should have just stayed

133
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,680
in the carriage and judi dench

134
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,390
goddamn it why would he do this that

135
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,040
cart is headed towards the Redcoats that

136
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
are chasing him also the guards are

137
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,070
suddenly thousands of dick lengths away

138
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,090
from Jack when they

139
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,620
we're mayor vagina links away a second

140
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,180
ago these two men need each other's help

141
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,579
to carry a board also if that's the case

142
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,750
they would not be able to hold Jack's

143
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,190
weight which they are currently ignoring

144
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,930
now this seems like a huge obstacle for

145
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,639
the guards to overcome but when we next

146
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,169
see them there's almost no fire and

147
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,580
they're still on Jack's tail but quite

148
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,720
honestly the movie can't seem to figure

149
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,010
out where these guards are at any given

150
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,960
moment movie is perfectly content lying

151
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,669
to us no one sees the man obviously

152
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,620
hanging from the Prancing Pony sign

153
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,820
Jack's dad is just hiding out near the

154
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,710
captain's daughter waiting 2x Mach and a

155
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,510
jack out of a tough situation I mean how

156
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,860
long was he waiting over there just in

157
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,870
case this app I had your footage of the

158
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,850
other crew everyone in London knows Jack

159
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,080
Sparrow is putting together a crew

160
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,850
except for Jack Sparrow it was too busy

161
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,080
raising funds to bribe the entire

162
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,060
British judicial system to keep up with

163
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,300
pirate gossip no sir the day they had a

164
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,979
ship you mean we don't have to leave our

165
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,300
current location to get exactly what we

166
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,040
need at this exact moment also kinda

167
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,419
hard to believe with all the information

168
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,919
the King had about Jack Sparrow being in

169
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,090
London that they never heard of the

170
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,800
captain's daughter tavern and the person

171
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,940
recruiting sailors here

172
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,670
Jack's dad is Batman somehow the room is

173
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,080
lit in such a way that it hides the

174
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,640
imposter Jack Sparrow's face it's

175
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,020
probably why nobody who interviewed for

176
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,470
the job

177
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,610
notice do you look like Penelope Cruz

178
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,320
when someone decides to run to a place

179
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,490
where Mayor boards prevent them from

180
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,230
falling I consider the sword fight to be

181
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,550
done until that person decides to walk

182
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,930
away from it why even bother chasing

183
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,970
this person why is every rope anyone in

184
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,470
this franchise grabs on to strong enough

185
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,060
and positioned in such a way it allows

186
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,170
them to swing to their desired

187
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:43,930
destination any one person online jack

188
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,250
is so confident in the statement he

189
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,480
forces this mystery person to kitchen

190
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,310
also I'm fairly confident that more than

191
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,450
one person in the world knows how to

192
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,190
spin around with a sword you were the

193
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,350
only pirate I thought I was past four

194
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,510
boys and everything you pulled that off

195
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,280
notice how he never heard her Jack

196
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,810
Sparrow impersonation I don't want to

197
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,310
question this action because part of me

198
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,660
approves of it but the other part of me

199
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,950
feels compelled to question it because

200
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,510
it has no purpose other than revealing

201
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,490
her cleavage which again I am for so

202
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,670
like her blouse I'm torn Jesus if we cut

203
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,750
out all the moments where someone tells

204
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,950
Jack that he's looking for the Fountain

205
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,720
of Youth and all the times Jack says he

206
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
could use a ship we probably should have

207
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,780
a solid 10 minutes off this picture was

208
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,340
ready to take my bow

209
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,530
can you what are you doing in a Spanish

210
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,550
convent anyway

211
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,140
chase position more than just three

212
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,850
Redcoats came running in here right so

213
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,680
what are the other guys doing waiting to

214
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
be tapped in just running around the

215
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,669
room aimlessly we have advantage it's

216
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,320
this kind of thoughtful nuanced writing

217
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,210
that really makes the series shine movie

218
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,560
perpetuates the myth that puncturing a

219
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,270
barrel with alcoholic liquid will cause

220
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,410
it to spew like a geyser when we arrived

221
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,850
at this bar there was no indication that

222
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,380
they were near any significant body of

223
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,000
water it's almost as if the environment

224
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,470
evolves in real-time based on what the

225
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,790
plot requires of it it's almost like

226
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,140
these guards are saying well they're

227
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,760
clearly gone forever no need to continue

228
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,710
in our pursuit okay now where the car

229
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,030
wait it's been 20 seconds since they

230
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,380
fell through the crap door and now we're

231
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,130
in a completely different location

232
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,919
forcing the mant twisties old hanging

233
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,200
ropes lie in your bed the way you made

234
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,750
so he doesn't have to tie the noose Wow

235
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,460
was that bit of dialogue even necessary

236
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,260
the map doesn't burn up immediately so

237
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,090
why not try and put the fire out salvage

238
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,890
what's there and kill gets is it because

239
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,540
he pulls well in the focus groups is

240
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,100
Disney trying to ensure kids never learn

241
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,880
how to read a map

242
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
I know semen but I can't imagine the

243
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,180
sales with giant holes in them would be

244
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,789
super effective huh this might yeah

245
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:22,570
about that

246
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,979
why was Penelope Cruz pretending to be

247
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,940
Jack Sparrow to recruit sailors when she

248
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,890
the first mate on Blackbeard ship does

249
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,060
Blackbeard have such a bad reputation

250
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,560
that he couldn't recruit anybody on his

251
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,510
own or did this movie just really need

252
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,800
some mysterious someone is impersonating

253
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,750
Jack Sparrow nonsense to get Jack on

254
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,530
this adventure

255
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,960
dad B's we may be steps we've been a

256
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,630
fortnight at the hands of a monic a

257
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,420
flame is the fountain yeah but while I'm

258
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,380
finding the fountain prevent the

259
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,000
one-legged man from killing it as we

260
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,380
find out the fountain only works by

261
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,120
taking the total years lived from one

262
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,740
person and adding them to another person

263
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,540
not makes you impenetrable to stab

264
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,490
wounds all those will soon find out this

265
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,510
movie doesn't know what the fountain

266
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,830
ritual actually does anyway so

267
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,030
ultimately the answer we're looking for

268
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,340
is this movie that should be so kind

269
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,160
just provide us an eddy wait you mean

270
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,530
just now after sailing this long here

271
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,790
are the Spaniards who should have a huge

272
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,260
head start on all the other expeditions

273
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,210
they have Ponce de león's book and

274
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,620
everything but here they are neck and

275
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,780
neck with the other theory on the proper

276
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,040
car skins I it be proper there's your

277
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,290
proof so now we kill Gibson follow the

278
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,430
Spaniards never so much has turned his

279
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,320
head maybe this is why they keep kids

280
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,120
around his vision is so impeccable he

281
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,320
can see what a normal man needs a

282
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,270
telescope to see I signed up to fail

283
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,070
into Jack's pattern of some Pretender

284
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,260
and a lady in that other than she does

285
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,729
keep up the Jack Sparrow routine so

286
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,110
these idiots don't mutiny on her for

287
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,919
being an imposter

288
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,300
it's because it wouldn't be sexy enough

289
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,380
Tom one of them really all of them there

290
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,700
are only six swords on this whole ship

291
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,530
also considering that they just started

292
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,610
talking about mutiny what was the

293
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,930
conversation like before this kid left

294
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,640
okay we're going to talk about mutiny so

295
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,170
we'll need swords alright what send the

296
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,540
child you have been monstrously deceived

297
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,080
God septic dead yes even jack is getting

298
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,550
irritated with the repetitive dialogue

299
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,170
instead of choreographing some real

300
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,700
action and fighting movie decides to

301
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,660
just cut cut cut cut itself to death to

302
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,070
create the illusion that these actors

303
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,680
can actually sword fight if Blackbeard

304
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,300
has rope telekinesis then why even

305
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,950
bother having a group can he just stand

306
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,300
on deck and command the ropes to do is

307
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,280
bidding should I pray for every

308
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,380
unfortunate soul on this hellbound this

309
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,490
oh come on

310
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,440
Florida's not that bad oh this guy

311
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,820
attended the Prometheus school rowing

312
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,890
away from things also Blackbeard wasted

313
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,570
a ton of flammable accelerant to kill

314
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,210
this one crewman that guy god dammit

315
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,740
Trident carving produces no blood

316
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,630
because the spirits of Voodoo are aware

317
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,920
of the reading this movie was shooting

318
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,440
for Wii

319
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,570
so did Angelica pretend to be jacked a

320
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,610
lure jack onto the ship somehow or were

321
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,780
they planning on making this trip

322
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,190
without jack because remember the only

323
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,540
reason Angelica dressed up as Jack was

324
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,040
because she felt like he was the only

325
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,540
pirate she could make believable there's

326
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,980
a lot missing from this backstory and

327
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,450
none of the explanations are good the

328
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,710
director said well honey your character

329
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,150
eat sliced apples it'll make you look

330
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,320
like even more an asshole

331
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,600
barmaid Beckford in hunger of hot fresh

332
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,370
have man character in movie begins

333
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,810
explaining things to other characters in

334
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,220
the movie that they surely already know

335
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,900
so it was about time this movie got back

336
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,820
to its roots can i hey you know read to

337
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,740
a list defunct why does she know the

338
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,090
ritual is it just an essential thing

339
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,830
she's tasked with knowing so the viewing

340
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,300
audience can rest assured she'll be here

341
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,610
for most of the movie lot from the

342
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,030
fountain up you this shimmering tear of

343
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,690
a mermaid the silver chalices of heavily

344
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,190
on I thought the Fountain of Youth was

345
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,090
supposed to be a naturally-occurring

346
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,250
magical body of water so how did ponce

347
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,840
de Lyonne figure out he needed that tear

348
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,880
from a mermaid and silver chalices that

349
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,400
he himself owned to make it work also

350
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,170
the movie Bremen trips off Indiana Jones

351
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,640
and the Last Crusade because why not

352
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,910
this item you may take hold the years of

353
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,650
life from another if that's the case

354
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,000
then the fountains name is incredibly

355
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,650
misleading why don't we change it to the

356
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,150
front of someone else's life it's the

357
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,200
mood you can explain how the black

358
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,390
parole you know what okay can we just

359
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,980
please get to the fountain without going

360
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,080
down all these rabbit holes I am surely

361
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,330
after Blackbeard why did you lie about

362
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,130
lying about being his daughter that what

363
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,200
purpose did that search they'd be drawn

364
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
to man laid like shock as this jackass

365
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,430
kid not been paying attention all

366
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,510
they've been talking about since they

367
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,650
got here or Myr raids

368
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,170
worse than shots boy both sharks and

369
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,340
mermaids will try to eat you but

370
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,770
mermaids are hot and topless days on to

371
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,560
a sting you can find this on page 47 of

372
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,600
the non fictional text how to comer made

373
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,430
in 10 days and they'd start using an

374
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,690
attack they could have used a lot sooner

375
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,290
than this also spider made Jack somehow

376
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,670
knew that mermaids would be scared of

377
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,440
this explosion mermaids have breasts but

378
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,550
they don't have nipples because the

379
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,990
genetics are compliant with the movies

380
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,540
pg-13 rating ever walk on the basis of a

381
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,790
conceal accepts in the fan if he says

382
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,050
something about seeing a second set of

383
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,310
footprints I'm turning it off

384
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,260
mermaids attack Barbosa ship but seemed

385
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,790
completely disinterested in the assholes

386
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,080
who are already on land which is a

387
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,550
severe departure from what they did last

388
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,080
night with Blackbeard's crew did they

389
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,150
run out of spider webs also why did they

390
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,830
wait to attack the ship after all the

391
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,210
main characters of this movie got to

392
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,570
land Oh

393
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,610
now that Barbossa ship is being sucked

394
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,470
look I going to get to the next place or

395
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,910
is this movie saying that white cat bay

396
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,440
is the final destination and they can

397
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,430
walk the rest of the way

398
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,990
furthermore aware of these assholes now

399
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,820
if it's raining on Whitecap Bay in

400
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,380
Barbosa can Blanca the next place then

401
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,550
where did Blackbeard go where it's

402
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,380
totally sunny why should we call from

403
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,899
Evernham because to yourself keep we

404
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,610
need them fresh and we also need to

405
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,139
develop a love story between the mermaid

406
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,670
and the philip also with this movie

407
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,069
joking this ritual requires fresh tears

408
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,319
seriously who made up these rules we

409
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,000
really want to be young that badly what

410
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,579
was removing water from the fountain and

411
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,800
a mermaids team and soos universe

412
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,170
chalices once kept with us year one

413
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,430
without I'm beginning to think this

414
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,660
movie was written by people who made

415
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,100
those puzzle adventure games where you

416
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,810
have to do some really convoluted just

417
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,310
to advance with no clues and no

418
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,139
explanation but the palms daily on the

419
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,699
answer was clear as day mermaid tears

420
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,740
and chalices here Ponce de Leon was also

421
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,660
a huge work fan also which came first

422
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,860
the Fountain of Youth or a pump de

423
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,509
Lyonne sounds like he's the one who made

424
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,220
the rules but isn't he famous for

425
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,600
looking for the fountain so how did he

426
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,130
come up with all this and if it wasn't

427
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,600
him and how did God come up with all

428
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,449
this iconic items if you read this kind

429
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:55,949
of dialogue for your main character that

430
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,029
might be a hint you're in need of a

431
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:57,660
second draft

432
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,610
she needs ass Phillip is not just a

433
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,620
clergyman he's also a mermaid expert you

434
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,600
get to choose mr. Sparrow

435
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,550
even though Blackbeard is I'm running

436
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,319
out of time he still has time for

437
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,380
Russian roulette if the voodoo doll

438
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,970
gives Jack the sensation of falling then

439
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,199
why doesn't he start drowning when the

440
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,819
doll hits water dance you think with the

441
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,019
amount of money of these movies continue

442
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,250
to make they could splurge on some

443
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,290
better animal CG on how much stay up to

444
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,449
earmark for depth wine exactly well of

445
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:25,860
course she grows legs if she's not in

446
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,329
water maybe that's why she never speaks

447
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:29,279
she sold her voice to an octopus drag

448
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,870
queen lady so she could have legs when

449
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,899
she's on land ha right he's young and

450
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,699
attractive mermaids only eat dirty old

451
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,529
pirates what was clear as day a few

452
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,329
minutes ago is now dark and foggy as if

453
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,889
this island changes the weather based on

454
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,389
whatever a movie needs at a given moment

455
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,639
so how did ponce de Leon's boat end up

456
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,079
on this clip was it placed there by the

457
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,370
screenwriter to set up a precarious

458
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,360
moment that will soon happen

459
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,399
mom's de Leone's buried in Puerto Rico

460
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,809
so I don't think he's on the right ship

461
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,879
sighs actually have to balance it out

462
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,920
further proof that there is no reason

463
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,059
for the ship to still be sitting here

464
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,670
after 200 years also how was Barbosa

465
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,779
able to sneak onto this boat without

466
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,489
calling balance issues if that boats

467
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,259
balance is so precarious and why was

468
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,910
Jack able to do the same without causing

469
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,139
any issues until they started sword

470
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,420
fighting Spanish there ahead of his

471
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,999
might well know their voyage wasn't

472
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,110
filled with pointless hijinks and

473
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,220
shenanigans Ponce either programmed his

474
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,689
dead body to be protective of the map

475
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,399
for some reason or he's still alive from

476
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,629
drinking from the fountain water and

477
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,459
mermaid tears problem is we find out

478
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,049
later that the fountain heals scar so

479
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,790
why would your body deteriorate and why

480
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,079
would you waste your time guarding a map

481
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,970
in this condition also I think the two

482
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,410
of you could probably win a fight with

483
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,209
the weird skeleton puppet you will not

484
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,519
talk Jack Phillip feels undying love for

485
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,929
the mermaid that he's only known for a

486
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,579
day which just proves that love at first

487
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:40,959
sight is real as long as you're

488
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,790
incredibly hot also can we all agree

489
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,019
that no one gives a shit about this

490
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,549
priest mermaid love story that begins

491
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,589
2/3 of the way through this movie just a

492
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:51,879
scratch so Barbosa keeps a super deadly

493
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,529
sword drawn dramatically raising the

494
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:54,850
risk that he could accidentally stabbed

495
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,319
himself not to mention giving Jack a

496
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:57,759
reason to ask about it so we'll know

497
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,809
about the frog poison now this Barbosa

498
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,279
directing this question to jack or the

499
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,749
director hi you deceive in that you're

500
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:09,669
not a gross middle-aged pirate man nor

501
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,829
are you Angelica who clearly has a thing

502
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,389
going with Jack process of elimination

503
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,509
love is still up he is in joy they say

504
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,699
these bees are more potent anyways where

505
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,049
are you getting this information how

506
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,519
many conversations about mermaid tears

507
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,899
are you having with your colleagues is

508
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,669
there a book to console the Spaniards

509
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,439
tie up Jack and Barbosa to trees that

510
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,879
are so far away they are in perfect

511
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,339
escaping range also why did Barbosa have

512
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,449
to go along with this Fountain of Youth

513
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,069
thing just to get back at Blackbeard I'm

514
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:34,629
sure there were ways much simpler than

515
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,100
infiltrating the British Navy to find

516
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,389
the magical fountain that Blackbeard is

517
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:39,009
also looking for in order to free

518
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,449
himself from the ropes Jack is going to

519
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,249
climb this entire palm tree somehow get

520
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,540
over the top of the palm tree and I

521
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,980
guess slide back down the tree like a

522
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,779
fireman or find some way to cartoonishly

523
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,429
bend the tree down you can't just have

524
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:49,749
him emerge from the leaves completely

525
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,399
free how did you get over those leaves

526
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,869
is it a magical rope to compan through

527
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,399
leaves how many magical ropes are in

528
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,310
this movie

529
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,750
movie did in fact go for some cartoonish

530
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,490
tree bending Jack through the power of

531
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,200
editing makes it past all these guards

532
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,700
using only a rope and manages to tie

533
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,530
them all to a tree because art imitates

534
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,690
life and life is stupid Jack and Gibbs

535
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,830
went through the trouble of catching a

536
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,870
pig so they could tie the chalasis to it

537
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,190
and make it run away if Blackbeard

538
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,660
didn't meet their demands seems like

539
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,770
there would be an easier way to do this

540
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,750
but I'm not making a movie to fund my

541
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,580
future Star Wars acquisition thankfully

542
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,260
Jack noticed this drop of water so that

543
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,550
he could eventually look through it

544
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,930
while at the same time looking directly

545
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,310
at the X that marks the spot

546
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,810
so why was that single drop of water

547
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,520
falling up when this giant pool of water

548
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,470
behaves like a normal pool of water such

549
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,000
just an indicator drop that they are

550
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,330
headed in the right direction aqua de

551
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,140
vida you have to say these words because

552
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,610
obviously after getting mermaid tears

553
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,410
locating chalices and actually finding

554
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,550
the location of the Fountain of Youth in

555
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,870
the first place you clearly haven't done

556
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:50,150
enough these people somehow here jack

557
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,860
over all the noise and all of them are

558
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,570
stopped by what jack has to say and

559
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,090
another is that pier still fresh I will

560
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,040
not have that smile in your face when I

561
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,110
strike you down Blackbeard's in a tough

562
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,850
spot on one hand if he doesn't kill

563
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,260
Barbosa then Barbosa is going to kill

564
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,590
him

565
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,820
on the other hand if he does kill

566
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,290
Barbosa that means the stupid-ass

567
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,060
prophecy is wrong and that will cut my

568
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,590
whole world of a prophecy in a movie is

569
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,010
wrong again only God can grant eternal

570
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,520
life not this vague on what if the

571
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,140
Spaniards came out simply to destroy the

572
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,490
front of you then why didn't they just

573
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,870
go ahead and do that they had a

574
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,730
tremendous lead on everyone getting to

575
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,140
this island and they knew the others

576
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,610
were coming for it furthermore couldn't

577
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,960
they simply just destroy the chalices

578
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,560
and call it a day

579
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,120
since you need to do all sorts of petty

580
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,350
to make the Fountain of Youth work

581
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,890
anyway

582
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,420
looks like the Spanish Inquisition went

583
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,010
to the Lois Lane school disposing of

584
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,980
things destroyed this provides up foe if

585
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,210
he really thinks that all this is both

586
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,680
paganism how does he explain the

587
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,060
floating water first off there is

588
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,560
apparently a mermaid route to the

589
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,220
Fountain of Youth

590
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,750
second off why did Serina use her

591
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,370
freedom to swim toward the fountain for

592
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,960
any reason I mean maybe she thought she

593
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,430
could save the heartthrob from Hunger

594
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,290
Games Catching Fire but she just gives

595
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,150
the chalices to Jack and pieces out so

596
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,740
her appearance here smells terribly of

597
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,660
ex machina and tuna again I gotta ask

598
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,700
why does this work the rules have been

599
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,560
stated clearly fountain adds years to

600
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,730
your life but there's never any

601
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,590
explanation about healing existing scars

602
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,480
or death blows I think this movie is so

603
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,100
Last Crusade it forgot what the power of

604
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,800
this water really is

605
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:17,980
I mean she totally eats him right Rach

606
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,900
any idea how to get her out which will

607
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,120
need a crossbow an hourglass three goats

608
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,980
one of us must learn to play the trumpet

609
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,870
was yelling because that is maybe this

610
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,610
movie is making fun of itself but this

611
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,050
is no sillier than what we just watch

612
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,300
and just as tedious heating load of

613
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,950
bulls washes up on the island where

614
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,750
Angelica has strained it o in the world

615
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,270
to travel as far and again I ask how to

616
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:45,659
jackknife round

617
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:48,190
well I don't want to be a pirate

618
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,679
please still hope again how'd you mother

619
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,909
here you made your point

620
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,510
go back who are you we're extremely hot

621
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,890
chicks with large breasts

622
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,320
let's drink I like it I know it's great

623
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,480
right no I regret this one it seemed

624
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,669
like forever claim in the glorious name

625
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:15,700
of His Majesty King nobody expects the

626
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:28,419
Spanish Inquisition various egos will

627
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:36,000
try to ship it
