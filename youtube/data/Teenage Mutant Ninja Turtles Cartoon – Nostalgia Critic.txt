00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,520
hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic guy

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,470
remember it so you don't have to and

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,970
welcome to a new portion of the show I

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,900
like to call Raiders of the story this

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,910
is where I take a popular nostalgic show

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,529
and look over the first few episodes to

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,420
see if it still holds up with that said

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,859
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as you all

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,199
know I love Ninja Turtles growing up I

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,510
was a here on a half-shell junkie but

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,490
now that I'm older is the show really as

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,630
good as I remember it

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,550
we know the movies definitely have flaws

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,110
but what about the television show that

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,940
turned these reptiles in the household

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,420
names

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,579
I mean after they were already household

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,590
names well I'm gonna look at the first

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,930
episodes to find out the ones from the

20
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,120
three VHS is that we all watched in the

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,370
80s and 90s so let's not waste any time

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,170
and start with turtle tracks

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,039
[Music]

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,840
here we go the very first episode of

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,969
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles it starts

26
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,920
out in New York City the crime wave is

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,300
high with monkeys mysterious and of

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,949
course the reporter leading the story on

29
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,040
these crimes is good old April O'Neil

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,049
ninjas oh I just remember the reasons I

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:10,799
love her so much

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,510
one other left and one on the right

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,729
these incisions could only have been

34
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,220
made with a samurai sword and look at

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,259
this rope this can only be the work of

36
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,600
ninjas the ancient band of Japanese

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,580
warriors and how can you tell that from

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,259
the Rope professor well look for

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,590
yourself it's made in Japan whoa that

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,409
shut me up so we see the shredder

41
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,090
watches the reporters through a secret

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,310
camera as he sends the cast of Mad Max

43
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,439
the musical to put a stop to their story

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,570
we got a message for you from the big

45
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,640
boss man he wants you should stick to

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,120

47
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,440
here

48
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,930
bullshit repressed that big wouldn't be

49
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,310
able to fit the pipe from Super Mario

50
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,710
Brothers but unfortunately she forgot

51
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,420
that she can't go through fucking walls

52
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,620
and gets herself Court sign often time

53
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,810
Neil oh but of course our green friends

54
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,760
come to safer as April can't believe her

55
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,470
eyes I don't know who you are but thanks

56
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,740
you're not human I can't handle this

57
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,330
so she wakes up in the turtles home it

58
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,280
passes out again I wish you'd stop doing

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,180
that

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,710
well she wakes up for a second time the

61
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,240
Turtles Master a rat named splinter

62
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,250
explains who they are

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,220
the story of my young friends and I is

64
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,470
really the story of a man named Hamato

65
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,610
Yoshi

66
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,080
he says his name used to be a motto

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,030
Yoshi and he was the master of a martial

68
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,100
arts clan known as the foot in Japan too

69
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,080
until his enemy named Naraku sake

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,700
literally stabbed him in the back

71
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,100
[Music]

72
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,550
so you plot to kill our honorable sensei

73
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,980
their sensei who looks like a scrotum

74
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,720
massage ball looks over the situation

75
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,010
and says throw the bomb out in disgrace

76
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,240
Yoshi fled to America penniless he was

77
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,220
forced to live in the sewers wait a

78
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,020
minute why did he go directly to the

79
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,660
sewers their shelters in New York and if

80
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,010
he's penniless how'd he get to America

81
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,110
in the first place and why doesn't he

82
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,160
get a job

83
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,290
those last two sentences are really

84
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,930
flawed okay so while living in the

85
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,820
sewers with the rats four baby turtles

86
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,890
drop down the drain and he decides to

87
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,810
take care of them as well he seems to

88
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,790
live a decent life most likely stealing

89
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,590
everything he possesses but then he

90
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,510
arrives home to a shock it was a

91
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,000
powerful mutagen this is back in the day

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,240
when science goo could just do anything

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,440
you can make up the most absurd

94
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,660
reasoning that has no scientific logic

95
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,720
but it's science good so it flies for

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,459
example let's see what happens if I take

97
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,320
this jar philadelphia cream cheese and

98
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,120
pour some science goo all over it

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,650
always turns into a 12-inch talking doll

100
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,720
of Dennis Miller science fucking sucks

101
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,970
man sighs fucking sucks hey what if

102
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,190
those crop circles were just ads for

103
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,650
target so since the turtles had most

104
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,270
recently been in contact with splinter

105
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,010
they turned human and since splinter

106
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,390
head was recently been in contact with

107
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,310
the Turtles he turns into a rat hey okay

108
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,810
he names them after the great

109
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,400
Renaissance painters because lord knows

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,380
this show has to teach kids something it

111
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,690
races them in the art of ninjitsu and

112
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,950
that is how they became the Teenage

113
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,710
Mutant Ninja Turtles Strait mob splinter

114
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,950
1989 so they decide to help April out in

115
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,330
discovering who's been committing all

116
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,340
these crimes but as you imagine they

117
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,210
don't fit in very well we all know this

118
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,400
game the woman over reacts runs away

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,680
screaming you're history scum now back

120
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:06,940
off exercise that right so they get

121
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,919
those famous trench coats and hats that

122
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,300
of course everybody into thinking

123
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,400
they're not Turtles as they come across

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,650
for lack of a better name the ninja

125
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,530
district ninja drycleaners ninja shoe

126

128
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,430
thing is these all sound like movie

134
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,430
coming this week odd C fee that's why FY

135
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,920
that whistling channel so I guess the

136
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,510
idea is that the niches work for the

137
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,370
shredder and hide in plain sight in the

138
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,290
Ninja District as the shredder keeps a

139
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,410
close eye on his enemies this April

140
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,390
O'Neil is getting closer to my operation

141
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,580
I lay myself for I should not have sent

142
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,220
a punk to do a ninja's job

143
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,200
so April finds a security building in

144
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,610
the Ninja district that just happens to

145
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,530
be the headquarters of the Foot Clan

146
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,270
I got another scientific equipment

147
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,970
company lined up just waiting to be

148
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,710
cleaned out I found him send a camera

149
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,660
crew

150
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,960
all right send a camera crew do hmm

151
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,040
by any chance is dead off so the turtles

152
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,630
follow the clues to where April is being

153
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,040
held and they're attacked by the Foot

154
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,810
Clan which it turns out is just a bunch

155
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,790
of robots robots robots that still use

156
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,560
ninjutsu weapons yeah by this point if

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
this shredder is seriously wondering why

158
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,300
he didn't just put guns on these guys

159
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,430
hell even old ladies on the street seem

160
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,200
to have guns in this world and yet these

161
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,820
guys are still fighting with sticks and

162
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,340
arrows Ilia technology is nice but a

163
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:07,530
bullet is still a bullet whoa wait a

164
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,650
minute

165
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,190
hello

166
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,510
looks like somebody's trying to cop a

167
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,280
shell no wonder she keeps getting

168
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,780
kidnapped all the time she's just

169
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,850
looking for a turtle feel down

170
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:26,090
[Music]

171
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,000
what are they doing down there did the

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,620
foot in the middle of escaping suddenly

173
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,890
decided to start sweating to the oldies

174
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,960
[Music]

175
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,310
but the foot escaped underground and

176
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,570
flood the rest of the building as

177
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,460
splitter fears that the shredder might

178
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,860
also be his mortal enemy Oroku Saki

179
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,140
which closes out our first episode and

180
00:07:51,140 --> 00:08:01,820
leads to the next one entitled what I

181
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,500
mean done that hurt is he still wearing

182
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,140
the sharp they're dense milord rope to

183
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,030
get my mind off that you know other than

184
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,010
the farms they strapped to their chests

185
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,130
I have absolutely no idea what makes the

186
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,020
Palestinians tick I don't get it so we

187
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,730
start with the last episode left office

188
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,930
the turtles are trying to find the

189
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,520
shredders giant vehicle called the

190
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,600
Technodrome

191
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,370
what's a Technodrome you might ask

192
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,920
that's a Technodrome what the hell is

193
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,660
the giant eye on the top of that thing

194
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,370
for anyway is it really how the shredder

195
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,260
sees things I always find the draw a

196
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,150
smiley face on there just to complete

197
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,210
the image

198
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,560
and yeah but you didn't know the

199
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,330
Technodrome was a stick shift either

200
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:57,010
we're finding out so much today so the

201
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,170
shredder goes to visit Krang talking

202
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,970
tumor with arms that sort of sounds like

203
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,740
that grandpa who can only eat applesauce

204
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,220
I am giving you the best technical

205
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,730
knowledge and by the way because people

206
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,020
will kill me if I don't bring it up

207
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,030
again that is Uncle Phil playing the

208
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,520
shredder and yes it is hilarious to dub

209
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,140
The Fresh Prince of bel-air over his

210
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,390
voice no dad stop me I'm gonna tie this

211
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,130
place up with so much litigation that

212
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,420
your grandchildren are gonna need

213
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,160
lawyers so turns out Krang is from

214
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,230
another dimension called Dimension X and

215
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,420
all he wants from shredder is take a

216
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:47,570
guess

217
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,339
so to sweeten the deal crank exchanges

218
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,170
some information he tells him that the

219
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,670
shredder could just used the mutagen

220
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,500
that was used on the turtles also on his

221
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,190
own henchman what suppose Yoshi had been

222
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,180
near a more power or an the world mutate

223
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,209
my own people the possibilities are

224
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:06,870
endless

225
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,490
I think I'll do it twice and then never

226
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,630
again oh the possibilities so he steals

227
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,220
two animals from the zoo and talks to

228
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,899
his henchmen to see who's up for a night

229
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,600
of ungodly genetic realignment I need

230
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,079
volunteers I need two of you for an

231
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,440
experiment forget it it will give you

232
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,130
strength and powers dreamed up so what

233
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,589
yeah this is what happens when shredder

234
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,690
uses Craigslist to get his henchmen

235
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,930
wanted fools to join my giant mutant

236
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,779
army of ninjas must like animals so

237
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,550
eventually he gets two volunteers and

238
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,319
turns them into the mutants bebop and

239
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,149
Rocksteady meanwhile the turtles

240
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,230
investigate the zoo robbery and come

241
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,899
across the Technodrome wait a minute how

242
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,550
come the police while investigating the

243
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,040
robbery didn't just oh I don't know look

244
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,110
down the friggin hole did they think

245
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,000
that if they just took a peek for a

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,920
second maybe they come across a giant

247
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,050
mechanical Faberge egg of death I mean

248
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,630
just look guys Master Splinter's walking

249
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:17,370
stick he must be in trouble so the

250
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,870
turtles go inside and come across a

251
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,290
bunch of death machines

252
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,340
so while fighting these killer

253
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,560
appliances Donatello says one of the

254
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,020
straining juice out of context lines

255
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:39,260
ever turtles fight with honor yes

256
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,840
because that turtle would never knock

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,750
down the robots lights dishonourably you

258
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,090
should know that audience something the

259
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:54,290
biker mice from mars with you

260
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,020
somebody find a device that I guess they

261
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,490
assumed as a bomb get trapped in a

262
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,930
corner with the supposed bomb strapped

263
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,670
into a wall praying it's a bomb and once

264
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,540
you know it it happens to be a bomb

265
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,520
Turtles sheep with honor they'd seen a

266
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,930
splinters been kidnapped and the

267
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,640
shredder reveals himself telling the

268
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,900
truth about his backstory

269
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,760
it was I who made you what you are today

270
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,660
if not for me

271
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,680
Hamato Yoshi whatever happen I followed

272
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,050
okay where is the shredder getting these

273
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,240
cameras I mean it's one thing to have

274
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,890
surveillance cameras but they seem to be

275
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,140
getting shots that nobody could get I

276
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,390
mean it's there just a what cameraman

277
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,860
walking around and everybody's too

278
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,060
polite to point him out

279
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,440
I mean seriously dude how are they

280
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:50,840
getting these in hindsight I really show

281
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,370
plan this out better Jamar splitter

282
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,050
we're checking out of his dump

283
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,520
so people fit rocks dude he tried to

284
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,140
blast him again but the turtles trapped

285
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,940
them and leave them behind thus ends

286
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,280
episode 2 as we begin the 3rd episode a

287
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,540
thing about rats

288
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,250
this one starts with an inventor named

289
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,140
Baxter Stockman who's created these

290
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,850
robots called mousers that can

291
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,170
apparently hunt down rats anywhere

292
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,400
[Music]

293
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,980
[Applause]

294
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,470
there's no place for pests to hide from

295
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,959
my mousers get rid of all rats huh

296
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,209
what are you crazy you want to drive me

297
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,100
out of business you won't make me a

298
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,720
millionaire which is extremely rare in

299
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,180
the world what's wrong with you the

300
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,069
short-sighted fool doesn't know what

301
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:38,149
he's missing Oh who are you someone who

302
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,910
wants to produce your Mouse's on a vast

303
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,899
scale

304
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,839
now really folks if you're approached by

305
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,850
a person with a business proposition who

306
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,199
looks like Darth Vader mixed with a

307
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:50,120
cheese grater you probably shouldn't do

308
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,649
business with him just straight up

309
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,899
common sense so Stockman makes a bunch

310
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,519
of these mousers and the shredder sends

311
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,259
them out to kill splinter but the

312
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:58,819
turtles arrive in time to save it

313
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:01,430
where'd these metal maniacs come from

314
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,250
where do you think Michelangelo

315
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,589
trademark Baxter Stockman inventions a

316
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,560
division of shredder Co so they go to

317
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,089
April to see if they can figure out

318
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,459
where to find this Baxter guy we're

319
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:15,379
looking for the genius who built this

320
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,800
his name is Baxter Stockman that's all

321
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,319
you've got to go on a name I mean it's

322
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,790
not like the Internet's been invented

323
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,110
yet

324
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,519
so she finds the information and the

325
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,470
turtles go looking for it but we also

326
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,000
find out that they may not have much

327
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,629
time

328
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,370
don't you wish to see the fruits of your

329
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,239
labor no I'm tired but it will go

330
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:41,149
he knows too much put him out of the way

331
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,999
I don't know shredder this guy just made

332
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,100
you a death weapon with a warthog a

333
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,679
rhinoceros ninja robots and not once

334
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,809
asked any questions let's say this guy's

335
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,139
worth keeping around what do you want

336
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,629
now

337
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,009
again the Turtles save them in time and

338
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:59,449
find out that the next Bunch are being

339
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:01,100
sent to April's apartment where splinter

340
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:09,679
is also I don't like the sound of that

341
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,880
ropes

342
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,840
oh my god the loss of innocent life lord

343
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,880
knows how many innocent families were in

344
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,690
there now are suddenly dead oh my god

345
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,120
the impact this must have on our heroes

346
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,610
boy they sure don't build them like they

347
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,380
used to

348
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,180
[Music]

349
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,880
inconsiderate bitch what the hell would

350
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,680
you say if you just saw the Hindenburg

351
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,230
disaster uh-oh SpaghettiOs

352
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,850
fuck oh you are a terrible person

353
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,190
so they fine with the shredders hiding

354
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,960
as Michelangelo sneaks in and tries to

355
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,120
stop the master control and get shredder

356
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,710
some credit this time he actually is

357
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,330
using a gun and now we can see why he

358
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,940
never uses it

359
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,400
so Donatello reprograms the mousers to

360
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,140
tear down the house by simply pushing

361
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,520
one button over and over but the

362
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,900
shredder gets away again in the

363
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,940
Technodrome that's the end of the

364
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,700
mousers yes but what about Michelangelo

365
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,110
really splinter you're gonna just stand

366
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,090
there one of your students might be

367
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,530
dying and you're not even gonna give a

368
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,780
gasp of disbelief that seems pretty

369
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,500
soulless I never liked him anyway I care

370
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,170
not for the potty dudes what they see

371
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,970
he's okay as we move on to our next

372
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,070
episode hot rodding teenagers from

373
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,030
Dimension X

374
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,220
isn't that a funky title it just sort of

375
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,290
a side note here most kids saw these

376
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,570
first few episodes on VHS us they didn't

377
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,610
run the first episodes on TV that often

378
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,380
we loved him at all but there was one

379
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,320
major problem with it on this VHS they

380
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,650
got episodes three and four backwards so

381
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,600
they would show hot rodding teenagers

382
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,370
first before they would show the one

383
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,590
with the mousers now with that in mind

384
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,660
just imagine you're a kid and you're

385
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,430
watching this episode without any

386
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,890
knowledge of the Mouser episode you just

387
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,930
saw but like what Baxter comes back

388
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,550
Baxter won't be back for a long time

389
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,980
Michelangelo the authorities didn't

390
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,600
appreciate it when he tried to take over

391
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,450
the city with his Mouser robots and I

392
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,190
didn't appreciate it when they ate my

393
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,000
apartment

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,820
Baxter Stockman April's ex-husband okay

395
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,160
well luckily the DVD has been an order

396
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,780
and this one begins with Donatello

397
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,030
putting together the turtle van because

398
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,160
as we heard in the opening Donatello

399
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,100
does machines no not like that you're

400
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,590
gross but shredder has another plan he's

401
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,420
going to open up the portal to Dimension

402
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,370
X and bring some of cranks armies over

403
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,620
which begs the question why he hasn't

404
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,940
just done this before but if I'm gonna

405
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,530
point out the laxen logic in the show

406
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,090
I'm gonna be here forever two soldiers

407
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,770
come out of the portal but so do some

408
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,789
rambunctious kids call the neutrinos

409
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:57,940
and why is it they look like vanilla ice

410
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:07,690
if they just got out of trough my god

411
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,980
it's the worst combination possible

412
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,429
beatniks hands hippies so after they get

413
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:14,019
the van put together the turtles find

414
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:15,460
out that then when the neutrinos are on

415
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,440
the same side the neutrinos actually

416
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,149
hate Dimension X as it seems to be

417
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:20,110
nothing but Wars

418
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:36,220
what is this Dimension X it's grim place

419
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,129
where everybody wants to do you in just

420
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:44,590
for the crime of being young when will

421
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,119
people realise the importance of

422
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,649
Dimension X Awareness Day why but the

423
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,809
stone warriors from Dimension X find

424
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,879
them and tried to hunt them down we said

425
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,499
we wouldn't let anyone hurt you and we

426
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,260
mean it come on

427
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,679
[Music]

428
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,500
guys you may want to actually fire those

429
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,000
weapons instead of just making laser

430
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,039
sounds with your mouths but the turtles

431
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,020
escape and consult Master Splinter about

432
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,250
what to do next

433
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,809
Turtles we gotta help them do it

434
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,360
don't worry Cala we won't let anything

435
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,590
happen to you

436
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,140
whoa I'm sensing some strange sporadic

437
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,390
sexual tension than the sewers today

438
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,549
turtles fight with jailbait so the

439
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,850
turtles reached the Technodrome enter

440
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,070
how do they just drive the van hundreds

441
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,110
of feet underground what are their like

442
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,429
tours that go through there so the

443
00:19:51,429 --> 00:20:04,320
turtles break in and start up a fight

444
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
there's a barrel of silicone lubricant

445
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,970
over there um lubricant are you sure

446
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,559
that wasn't intended for a previous

447
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,750
episode but the turtles have to leave to

448
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,429
stop one of the stone warriors weapons

449
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,350
from destroying the city they knock it

450
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,029
out and head back halt which leads to

451
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:20,830
the final episode in our story arc

452
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,549
shredder and splinter how confusing it

453
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:26,110
starts out with the shredder appearing

454
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,210
at the Turtles TV saying he has a device

455
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,799
to turn the mutations back to their

456
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,570
original form you know something I never

457
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,429
got what doesn't he just take that big

458
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,710
fucking Technodrome the squashing all

459
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,730
right dudes

460
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,880
let's go find the shredder so they tried

461
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,440
to use one of the leftover neutrinos

462
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,809
cars to get there

463
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:55,710
but that doesn't seem to work it looks

464
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,120
like we're out of fuel

465
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,110
what sort of juice does this crate take

466
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,330
plutonium I think not terrific maybe we

467
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,889
can get a tow to the nearest plutonium

468
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,600
station you don't just walk into a store

469
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,639
and buy plutonium

470
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,379
so Donatella says he can whip up another

471
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,330
form of transportation at Baxter's lab

472
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,190
but bebop and Rocksteady find them and

473
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:21,629
try to bash their brains out turtles

474
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:24,679
fight with cement

475
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,149
so as the turtles finally made it to the

476
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,919
Technodrome the shredder at long last

477
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,990
constructs a body for Krang and holy

478
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,230
hell who the fuck design matters that is

479
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,470
like the strangest most bizarre thing

480
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,749
I've ever seen in my life he looks like

481
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,610
a mix between Dolph Lundgren and that

482
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,340
weird giant from Goonies I mean was Boy

483
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:52,769
George designing a wrestler well that's

484
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,690
going on April goes back to work to try

485
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,190
and get a camera crew to film all the

486
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,740
action I'm trying to get a story for you

487
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,950
try four green maniacs are running loose

488
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,960
in this town and you haven't brought me

489
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,869
diddly squat whoa hey watch the language

490
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:11,549
pal any further and we be in

491
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,279
fiddle-dee-dee territory but luckily she

492
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,259
uses all her coaxing techniques to get

493
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,100
what she wants

494
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,529
and by coaxing I mean terrorist threats

495
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,470
it's a hyper turtle death ray now order

496
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,999
me a news girl turn this whole place

497
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,039
into a flaming rubble

498
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:31,499
she's tenacious so crane makes it so

499
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,059
bigger and gets right to destroy the

500
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,039
turtles but just then Donatello arrives

501
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,100
with this new invention come on guys

502
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,290
welcome aboard the Turtle blimp well I

503
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,080
hate so he took a piece of equipment the

504
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,120
size of a counter made a frigging bullet

505
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,810
out of it

506
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,660
he's like the MacGyver of gods so two of

507
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,280
them sneak into cranes body and try to

508
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,530
find the device to shrink him down there

509
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:12,830
it is let's cut it out of there so crash

510
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,540
winds down but the shredder whips out

511
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,160
his ray and gets ready to turn them back

512
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,250
into ordinary Turtles well gang looks

513
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,430
like it's back to old pet shop for us

514
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,670
far from it tonight I dine on turtle

515
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,750
soup with pillowy mounds of mashed

516
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:37,240
potatoes

517
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,890
so the Rey is destroyed but the turtles

518
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,870
decide it's time to stop a shredder once

519
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,680
and for all

520
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,420
so Donatello did I mention those

521
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,610
machines figures out the alien

522
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,500
technology and such the Technodrome

523
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,050
itself into Dimension X turtles

524
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,270
unrealistically master alien technology

525
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:07,930
with honor

526
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,420
I love when the shredder is just a whiny

527
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,640
bitch that's what he's the funniest i

528
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,590
wanna conquer now did be my ass and

529
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,510
those are the first five Teenage Mutant

530
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,400
Ninja Turtles cartoons are they silly

531
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,830
yes but what's it worth the kind of plot

532
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,780
there's a lot of good fourth wall jokes

533
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,370
and the animation on the action scenes

534
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,260
is actually pretty impressive at the

535
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,170
time it's definitely clumsy but there's

536
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,060
a lot of wrong voices coming out the

537
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,920
wrong Turtles and there's a lot of plot

538
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,420
threads they also don't make a lot of

539
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,700
sense but the timing was pretty good but

540
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,340
it's definitely however for my money

541
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,990
they still got some good lasting good

542
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,720
action up hits kid shows go it's stupid

543
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,670
but it's enjoyably stupid and a ton of

544
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,320
fun to watch if you ever feeling

545
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,210
nostalgic for some awesome turtle action

546
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,520
this is the place to go so thanks for

547
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,140
watching my first Raiders of the story

548
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,110
arc I hope you enjoyed it and hey next

549
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,000
month is January you know what that

550
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:16,660
means

551
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:25,790
that's the news and I am out of here

552

553

turtles fight with honor
