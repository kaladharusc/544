00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,850
hey everybody welcome back to another

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,220
episode of kicks I can't do this without

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,460
a hat okay so I couldn't find a hat but

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,040
I found this Reynolds this Reynolds Wrap

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,360
I think we can make a pretty good

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,119
makeshift h3h3 beanie I know it looks

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,920
more like a chef's hat right now but I

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,210
think it looks pretty good

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,640
shout out to equals 3 hey everybody

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,960
welcome back to another episode of kick

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,430
starter crap today we will be looking at

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,760
shield signal proof head wear aka the

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,010
tinfoil hat although it's a stylish

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,699
hipster tinfoil hat the whole world is

15
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:37,469
composed of reflections small and large

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,300
minor and great silent and deafening

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,069
unimportant and extremely important

18
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:47,710
really fucking gay not very gay at all

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,549
Adolf Hitler Dali llama sound is

20
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:56,350
reflected image is reflected light heat

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,440
power are reflected you guys should

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,909
definitely be taking notes on this this

23
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,399
is the theory of reflection for every

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,019
reflection there's an equal and opposite

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,450
reflection it's a very well-known theory

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,190
they teaching all the prestigious

27
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,290
colleges out there basically what it

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,080
means is for every black there's a white

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,470
for every straight there's a gay we came

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,300
up with an idea on how to reflect

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,850
something that can harm us hey guys for

32
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,220
the Kickstarter campaign I'm not so sure

33
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,110
we can use the phrase something that can

34
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,420
harm us I think we might get in trouble

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,850
if we say that oh no I think we're good

36
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,190
dude we said something we said can these

37
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,020
are vague terms any way we could say

38
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,520
whatever the fuck we want and we'd be

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,350
covering our butts right anything can

40
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,840
harm us a Loch Ness monster that can

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,420
harm us a unicorn horn mean YouTube

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,420
comment those can all harm us will day

43
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,100
will they not that's up to the customer

44
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,040
to decide 230 morons

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,180
I think the morons have their own

46
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,400
subcategories though you got hipster

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,530
moron and then you got person who's

48
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,090
legitimately afraid of government

49
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,250
mind-control and they see it as a legit

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,320
upgrade to the recurrent tinfoil hat we

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,420
are introducing a hat that reflects

52
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,490
harmful signals from telephones and

53
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,379
electrical appliances because the

54
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,370
electromagnetic smog is truly ever

55
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,280
imagine a stylish hat I've got to be

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,960
stylish because if you wear the tinfoil

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,490
hat people look at you funny you know I

58
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,660
don't I don't want to wear the tinfoil

59
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,820
hat but by wear tinfoil hat that's

60
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,340
disguised as a beanie people might be

61
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,930
like hey maybe you can rub two sticks

62
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,510
together and make fire hell yeah that

63
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,240
fits incredibly well not only on you but

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,250
your closest friends as well of course

65
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,320
you got to get your baby a hat I mean

66
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,690
just a no-brainer oh really so no brain

67
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,460
your baby won't have a brain if you

68
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,860
don't get it - tinfoil hat a head you

69
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,720
can take with you to the mountains to

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,750
ski on a bike a lot of first date oh I

71
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,030
hat you can take with you on a first

72
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,920
date oh hell yeah but looking for a hat

73
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,170
like that for decades well is there

74
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,570
anything this hat can't do to school to

75
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,820
work and even on a plane you mean to

76
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,100
tell me that I can wear this hat to a

77
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,350
stag party in the next morning I can

78
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,640
meet with Barack Obama

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,790
that's how versatile this hat is oh shit

80
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,970
someone pinch me I must be fucking and

81
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,610
now imagine a hat that has in addition

82
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,890
to all that's been said already Oh in

83
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,600
addition to everything that you listed

84
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,060
already all those features weren't on a

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,890
bike wear it on a boat we're on our

86
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,960
plane you mean all those features all

87
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,630
those incredible features Oh in addition

88
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,060
to all those incredible features guess

89
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,250
what else it is it protects against

90
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,890
invisible electromagnetic smog the

91
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,500
revolutionary shield has this is the

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,120
reason life expectancies are just

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,860
plummeting as of late it's because we

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,000
got all these light bulbs and

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,830
refrigerators that are just fucking with

96
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,600
our brains giving us brain cancer dying

97
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,370
before we even reach the age of 30 a

98
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,440
stylish head we're reflecting an

99
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,750
unwanted signal from mobile phones Wi-Fi

100
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,840
routers transmitters satellites and even

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,970
the radiation of an ordinary microwave

102
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,830
Oh bless the people who make this hat

103
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,720
they they really they should get more

104
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,430
recognition for making this hat right

105
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,110
because I mean look how much good

106
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,400
they're doing that not only are they

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,110
protecting you from the radiation from

108
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,900
microwaves and nuclear fallout and all

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,820
this other shit they're giving it to you

110
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,040
in style it stops the penetration of

111
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,250
harmful electromagnetic radiation let's

112
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,280
say for a moment that their theory of

113
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,330
electromagnetic waves passing through my

114
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,130
head and given me brain cancers is

115
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,930
completely true I mean they didn't make

116
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,960
any of these claims but that's all the

117
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,550
implication is right I mean they're they

118
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,229
they can't make any of these claims cuz

119
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,610
none of it's fucking real there's no

120
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,830
data there's no statistics backing any

121
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,840
other bullshit up right but let's say

122
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,550
it's true how am I going to be using my

123
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,319
smartphone most of the time I'm gonna

124
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,300
bring it right here and turn it on and

125
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,970
check my email oh no electromagnetic

126
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,979
waves and Wi-Fi signals are pulsing

127
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,479
through my head there was a small group

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,340
of MIT students who actually did a study

129
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,069
and found that the tinfoil hat actually

130
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,160
amplified the radio waves the shield Hat

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,020
contains a special layer that has

132
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,509
excellent antibacterial anti

133
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,699
and anti-radiation features

134
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,770
anti-radiation anti-odor anti static

135
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,860
radar invisible infrared invisible guys

136
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,780
wienie give these to our soldiers not

137
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,669
only are they good at making hats that

138
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,039
protect they're also good at making

139
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,199
sentences that are meant to protect

140
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,210
themselves but instead are just terribly

141
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,039
worded we are not saying it protects

142
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,599
100% against all kinds of

143
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,370
electromagnetic waves that are bad for

144
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,409
your health you realize there were like

145
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,960
three layers there of them trying to

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,909
cover their butts what we are saying is

147
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,949
that if you care about yourself be smart

148
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,509
and put on the first signal proof

149
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,610
apparel instead of the usual one they're

150
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,500
doing this weird over-the-top parody but

151
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,419
it's not a parody you see they're saying

152
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,070
you care about yourself and your health

153
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,020
you buy this product it's like you're

154
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,370
really gonna fucking insult my

155
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,870
intelligence that much saying that I'm a

156
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,340
fucking retard if I don't buy your

157
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,830
cancer beanie Oh a picture with a quote

158
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,690
over it I wonder who that quotes from oh

159
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,639
it's the quote that's right underneath

160
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,560
it apparently they thought be smart and

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,479
put this signal proof hat instead of the

162
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,729
usual one was the best thing they

163
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,409
fucking wrote in the whole project a

164
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,570
very good highlight what is the main

165
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,400
difference between tin foil and shield

166
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,650
hat our head is not the improved version

167
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,780
of tin foil hat it's inspired by actual

168
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,330
situation and studies and shield is more

169
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,099
beautiful and comfortable hat than tin

170
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,930
foil winky face you retarded fucking

171
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,190
foreigners you see the words they're

172
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,159
using its inspired by studies that what

173
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,949
he means to say is very are no studies

174
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,469
many people are asking about signals

175
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:31,789
that come through other parts of head

176
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,529
and hit the inside of the reflective cap

177
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,839
then pass through the brain a second

178
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,490
time or

179
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,620
within and multiplied their power this

180
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,940
is ridiculous

181
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,340
oh really no you don't get to use the

182
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,840
word ridiculous if you're making a

183
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,699
glorified tinfoil hat Kickstarter

184
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,500
project there's no way that you're able

185
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,780
to dismiss this very legitimate question

186
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,000
by saying that is ridiculous

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
it isn't ridiculous if this head

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,259
legitimately reflects signals then

189
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,599
surely when it passes through my skin

190
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,430
goes into my brain and hits a tinfoil

191
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,310
over reflect back right I mean as absurd

192
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,590
as the whole fucking concept is that's a

193
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,479
legit question this project should

194
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,220
fucking retard to do the way things are

195
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,940
phrased it's all

196
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,039
