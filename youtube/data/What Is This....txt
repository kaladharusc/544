61
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
my god isn't this like the best dubstep

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,840

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,820
[Music]

64
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:44,440
it's like annoying noise oh my gosh I

65
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,720
can't believe they did this why would

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,850
they just put cobblestone down that's

67
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,400
not even cool man it's just a waste of

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,810
time it's just a freaking waste of time

69
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,980
okay okay we're gonna do that later

70
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,050
let's let's go back I don't know where

71
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,220
they live I don't know where they live

72
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,970
but what I do know is it can't be too

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,270
far from where they originally lived oh

74
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,700
I know I'm gonna do with one of my uh I

75
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,530
have a flint and steel in my yes I do

76
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,890
infinite fire okay my old base my old

77
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,620
base said they blew up I think did I

78
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,780
finish transfer oh it's a lag if the lag

79
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,300
is so bad

80
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,640
let's get stuff that we want or need

81
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,450
possibly could use and something we

82
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,460
won't regret when we leave there's some

83
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,340
three times compressed did I take it

84
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,010
these ones I'm pretty sure I can't I

85
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:57,280
shift down I fly down yeah I don't think

86
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,220
I need anymore

87
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,660
yeah I think everything else we can we

88
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,310
could probably blow up we can probably

89
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,300
blow up I don't know what this does I'm

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,840
a good chance I could die a really good

91
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,310
chance I'm gonna put everything away

92
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,080
this is the first time I'm even messing

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
with one of these little tea and tea

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,100
things but um oh wait I need this let's

95
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,360
see what this does

96
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,050
is that was that it was that it

97
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:39,300
Wow that's that that's that didn't

98
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,120
really do much did it I didn't do

99
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,860
anything at all I was expecting like a

100
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,479
big giant boom like this giant crater

101
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,050
over here man

102
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,990
yeah that embarrassing quite

103
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,630
embarrassing so another thing I wanted

104
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,039
to check out because I noticed there's

105
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,050
some trees over here there's tree portal

106
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,060
a tree portal I don't know what that

107
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,919
does but if I go if I go and if I go in

108
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,220
here at the between lands we're going to

109
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:16,639
the where somewhere

110
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,649
somewhere do I have my weapon my weapon

111
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,819
of choice let's put all this stuff back

112
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,259
we don't need it

113
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,499
weapon of choice probably don't have it

114
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:32,959
we're gonna have to use an iron sword

115
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:40,800
food more food and more food what it

116
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,559
turned rotten no where am I

117
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,199
mushroom cap this is this is kind of

118
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,709
freaky man I'm doing pretty good

119
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm doing pretty good how are you guys

120
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,779
how you guys doing in the chat for those

121
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,930
you don't know we're on troll PAC I'm an

122
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,290
algae what's this okay somebody killed

123
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,550
one of those things wow that's really

124
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,759
trippy this is really a cool place like

125
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,040
it's actually really cool but is there

126
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,759
anything here that's like you know worth

127
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,860
looking at because from what I'm seeing

128
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,050
I don't see anything but a bunch of dead

129
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:57,720
stuff a bunch of dead stuff

130
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,040
doesn't look like it doesn't look this

131
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,070
this this dimension looks like a waste

132
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,520
of time

133
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,830
to be honest looks like a pretty good

134
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,530
waste of time what's this over here I

135
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,570
see a couple things that looks like a

136
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,260
wooden thingamabob looks like a tree is

137
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:20,730
there anything in here no just just wood

138
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,420
how disappointing and this is what - is

139
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,270
it rubber tree log I I'm familiar with

140
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,880
the rubber tree what is that I would

141
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,240
rather be a firefly but let me be a

142
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,040
firefly yeah I I can't see anything good

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,570
in this in this dimension

144
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,870
so let's fly and find a way to go go

145
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,870
back oh that's that's a big tree this is

146
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,610
a big tree there there has to be

147
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,250
something good on this big tree it's

148
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,350
like crazy craft or it's like emerald

149
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,200
tree like oh my good no no it's not it's

150
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,340
it's not we're lost

151
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:18,580
wait not a good idea yeah okay maybe

152
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,080
it's a good time to use the second one

153
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:36,570
[Music]

154
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,730
okay okay okay I understand okay what is

155
00:11:41,730 --> 00:12:00,660
this what effect am I getting I'm

156
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,640
literally gonna die here oh boy oh boy

157
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,930
this was not a good idea

158
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,760
okay this was probably the worst idea I

159
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,560
have all my good stuff in my inventory

160
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,120
if I die here this is gone

161
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,470
is it gone please tell me it's gone

162
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,430

213
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,810
maybe if I stay low to the ground

214
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,520
please just one portal just one portal I

215
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:12,000
did /spawn and the portals aren't there

216
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,330
okay okay this is spawn this is spawn

217
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:28,360
where it where I'm at and this is not

218
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,390
good at all guys I know I said that like

219
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,760
five million times where am I

220
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,510
Bert where am I

221
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:50,260
I don't even see myself on the map do

222
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:57,380
you see do you see me on the map

223
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,870
oh no oh no it took me to the place

224
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,910
somewhere totally different somewhere

225
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:16,580
totally different okay okay we are not

226
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,610
anywhere near where we where we

227
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:31,420
teleported in this is this is really

228
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:46,910
maybe nope I am in a totally different

229
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,960
time and space continuum I said that

230
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,070
because it makes me look smart

231
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:01,190
what we need is do I have one I don't

232
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,460
think it would work anyways that's not

233
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,700
very good okay so our only chance is

234
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,650
gonna be finding a portal a tree with a

235
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,160
portal in it the chances of that I

236
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,050
literally have no idea this is the first

237
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,550
time I'm even in this dimension why did

238
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:23,120
I even go here what what why was it my

239
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,070
idea to just to just go here was I just

240
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,010
like let's just go here fun oh my

241
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,040
goodness nope nope it's pretty horrible

242
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,980
to be honest o'clock

243
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,790
yeah that's definitely a clock Oh bro

244
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:54,780
okay there has to be somewhere somewhere

245
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,040
there's nobody in the streaming rooms

246
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,240
there's nobody on but me I can't be

247
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,530
rescued the rescue mission would fail oh

248
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:18,340
oh oh no no portals no trees no portals

249
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,049
okay now I'm like just really determined

250
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,290
just to get back there has to be

251
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,140
somewhere like literally somewhere there

252
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,500
has to be a tree portal what did it what

253
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,230
did it even look like when I came here

254
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:39,330
the trees that were portals this is just

255
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,610
not my this is not my cup of tea right

256
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,980
now is it

257
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,700
can you even make a tree portal how do

258
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,200
you even make a tree portal I have no

259
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,990
idea I didn't do research I just thought

260
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,460
it'd be good to just go out on a whim

261
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:02,890
and you know this looks interesting this

262
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,850
just the same okay no that's that's

263
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,040
stuff okay that's that's not good

264
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,340
oh wait wait is this supportive no no

265
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,080
that's just green stuff is this portal

266
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,220
okay someone shooting at me I I'm

267
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,530
totally lost man you know I should have

268
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,760
done you know what I've been the smart

269
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,790
thing was to do a portal from with my

270
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,900
portal gun use a portal from where my

271
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,580
original portal was so if I got lost

272
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,750
like this I could have just made a

273
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,680
second portal I I did /spawn it took me

274
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,230
to like totally opposite where I'm

275
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,140
supposed to be it's cuz I'm in a

276
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,250
different dimension it's uh not the

277
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,470
smartest thing I've done probably

278
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,810
actually the stupidest thing I've done

279
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,270
but you know at least we can raid

280
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,450
certain stuff Noorie crystal block I

281
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,030
have so many err charms it's not even

282
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:16,420
funny hmm I'm regretting going here

283
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:27,629
like really regretting going here

284
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:36,029
or maybe is that where I needed to go

285
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,620
doesn't even show where I came in like

286
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,870
where did I start okay we're going back

287
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,929
to spawn as stupid as that sounds it

288
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:55,480
sounds like a smart idea to me wait how

289
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,450
did it not I'm confused

290
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,820

305
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,379
we'll come across a portal trying to

306
00:22:56,379 --> 00:23:00,029
find our original portal you never know

307
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,290
you never know

308
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,510
but they're in the bottom of the trees

309
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,850
that's what's up that's that's what I

310
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,510
remember

311
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:19,030
that's what I remember anyways okay we

312
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:26,000
should be almost here yeah we can I like

313
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,210
actually move no it doesn't let me move

314
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,480
off with the mini-map up that's not good

315
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,120
the trees man this place is actually

316
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,660
starting to freaking out a little bit

317
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,560
now we are closed

318
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,420
all right yeah this is seems kind of

319
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,270
familiar we're back to where we

320
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,210
originally were at and now this is where

321
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,690
we kind of have to look because this is

322
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:08,210
oh no wrong one we need to fly we need

323
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:19,390
to fly we only have one heart this way

324
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,960
this way

325
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,750
