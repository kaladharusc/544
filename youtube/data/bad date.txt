32
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,710
piledriver

33

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,280
nineteen ninety-five percent of these episodes are shot on my big fat SLR

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,190
camera this thing but always always always had this low terrible really

37
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,690
embarrassing hip out and I keep a point and shoot there and the reason for that

38
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,650
is like no sometimes I don't have that big thing with me always good to have a

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,630
backup camera the camera have been using is this a canon g7x it's pretty good

40
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,810
camera autofocus is terrible this is it's big brother

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,820
the canon g7x mark two i've been waiting for this thing to come out my homies

42
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,340
that canine camera hooked it up

43
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,580
great guys thank you want for making that happen

44
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,120
I will test this thoroughly expect a comprehensive review of the g7x mark -

45
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,380
when the Setting Sun aligns precisely with the Manhattan street grid creating

46
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,640
a radiant glow of light across Manhattan's brick and steel canyons

47
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,440
i'm quoting the great Neil deGrasse Tyson here simultaneously illuminating

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,280
both the north and south sides of every cross street in the borough's grid a

49
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,700
rare and beautiful sight ok twice a year

50
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,210
this thing happens where the Setting Sun aligns with the streets in New York City

51
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,600
so literally like you look down the street and the sun is set

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
look this is what it looks like

53
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
