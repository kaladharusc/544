13
00:00:50,239 --> 00:01:03,650
the hell are you doing

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,010
so why the hell did you take that way

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,930
what do you mean it's the only way so

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,620
there's a path here on the left it's a

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:48,660
bridge bridge good Joe get over here you

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,610
know my dad always told me I like to

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,700
learn the hard way and that's kinda like

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,040
what happens in this game your best

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,860
friend Jonah who has a much bigger role

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,410
here in the third game kind of follows

23
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,440
laura around her adventure but when they

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,350
split and it just so happens they get

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,340
split up a lot he's always at the finish

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,000
just waiting for you after this huge

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,470
convoluted section that you had to go

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,240
through to get there and I'm like what

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,290
the fuck Sookie already this must lead

30
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,070
to the next clue go I'll stay here see

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,360
what else I can find of course he's

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,069
gonna stay there there's going he's

33
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,810
gonna find a better way he's gonna go

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,180
around and she's gonna take the hard way

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,980
I was just funny to me anyway shadow of

36
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,319
the Tomb Raider starts off really really

37
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,580
good and it's actually rather brutal I'd

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,340
recommend this game and I don't want to

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,010
see it buried in this really busy time

40
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,620
but it's not without its faults and

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,870
since it's the last game in a trilogy

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,660
I'm gonna be a little harder on it some

43
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,720
tough love and I do love this reboot

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,330
series and Crystal Dynamics has done a

45
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,569
wonderful job on them this one is Paul

46
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,659
it's beautiful it's intense and very

47
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,000
impressive at times especially in the

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,579
graphics department on a PC width of

49
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,000
good graphics card look at the month at

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,239
so they look good they look good oh

51
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,819
that's a good month however I feel by

52
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,980
the third game it's playing it way too

53
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,530
safe it's just really not innovating

54
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,290
anymore and it's always going to get dr.

55
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,200
points for you know on my show for that

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,659
you have to bring a bit more each and

57
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,329
every time at least for me so well it

58
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,150
doesn't innovate in huge ways and likely

59
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,069
won't attract any new players outside

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,069
those that already know and enjoy the

61
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,040
previous games I still think that there

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,709
is a lot of people out there that would

63
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,799
enjoy the first two and this one by

64
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,109
extension they just simply haven't even

65
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,180
tried it yet so if you're done with

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,430
spider-man and you love Uncharted or

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,949
Indiana Jones but you haven't played any

68
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:19,799
of these three games you need to buy at

69
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,289
least one and place you owe it to

70
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,810
yourself monkeys take pictures okay

71
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,880
we've crashed in the jungle no food or

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:37,560
water time for a selfie see some monkeys

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,330
you don't want to do fish boat yeah and

74
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,669
this monkey Laura by now is a pretty

75
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,820
efficient killer the body count in in

76
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,060
shadow is surprisingly high I was mostly

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,710
saying to myself god damn Laura aim fire

78
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,560
oh my boy

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,040
it did man that's who you are the

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,160
Gameboy the so what is it still

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,030
takedowns have a sometimes an awkward

82
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:29,610
interaction if the enemy is too far away

83
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,110
you want to talk I think it would happen

84
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:39,570
upstairs you literally killed 10 people

85
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,740
especially now that she could pull her

86
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,520
best

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Arnold impression as she slathers muddle

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,680
over her body and a new stealth mechanic

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,930
and sort of hides up against foliage for

90
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,010
silent kills

91
00:05:52,010 --> 00:06:06,950
[Music]

92
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,230
you know I can see right yeah you're

93
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,100
standing right here

94
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,280
it's terrible camouflage you just rubbed

95
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:26,720
mud all over your body despite the

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,390
massive body count by the enders really

97
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,580
actually more emphasis this time around

98
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,030
on actual tombs and a ton more

99
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,220
platforming sections and some new

100
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,100
puzzles instead of like the combat and

101
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,590
exploration so if that sounds good to

102
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,680
you this is the game for you and while

103
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,390
there's still those gunfight

104
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,040
you know firefight sections from the

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,590
first two games including one scripted

106
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,830
one that goes so far over the top that

107
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,110
it's ridiculous I started laughing out

108
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:32,200
loud oh my god the only way I could die

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,420
you are actually far more incentivized

110
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,150
to stealth your way through these with

111
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,520
one-hit kills rather than getting into

112
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,350
the open gun battles with everyone

113
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:52,130
especially on higher difficulty levels

114
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,510
don't jump around hit him

115
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,700
fire fire fire fire fire heal heal heal

116
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,980
heal we didn't get the W spells did we

117
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,990
and thankfully the stealth combat is

118
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,780
improved it feels great that is a big

119
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,760
compliment to coming from me and other

120
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,430
Jo which usually suck at stealth games

121
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,800
and don't like them though I will say it

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,350
does have some problems with aiming at

123
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,660
enemies when they get up a bit too close

124
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:32,910
to you enough under our sucky stick race

125
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:40,900
he's too close now a lot of the things

126
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,790
that we come to know and love from this

127
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,140
series they're still here

128
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,660
there's survival instinct mechanic to

129
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,790
highlight important things in the world

130
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,090
the intense rush running segments of

131
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,370
massive destruction happening all around

132
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:20,740
you the the Laura death prawn scenes the

133
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,170
fitting Laura into like little tight ass

134
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,910
spaces which have become series staple

135
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,890
I chose the Tomb Raider she gets into a

136
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,780
lot of small spaces so you gotta go in

137
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:43,420
there clowns I don't go in there for

138
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,810
disparity go going down top jump it's

139
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,250
right Suzy go in there hear that no I'm

140
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,780
not going in there damn it Joe dead pass

141
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,090
I'm out

142
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,400
but puzzlingly some good ones are kind

143
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,010
of missing like those cool slow-mo gun

144
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,830
battle sections of old or those really

145
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,450
fun collectibles where you turn it

146
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,640
around and spin it to learn more things

147
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,330
about them which actually was one of my

148
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,670
favorite aspect from the first game and

149
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,070
I kept hoping to see this mechanic and

150
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,750
other games that they would start doing

151
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,480
it but it's mostly gone here just a tiny

152
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,910
few of them and that doesn't make any

153
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,690
sense

154
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,970
since it was tomb Raider's unique aspect

155
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,010
and it loses it here for no reason

156
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,020
especially when there's even more tombs

157
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,330
and more opportunity for a little cool

158
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,490
little Mayan and Incan artifacts than

159
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,340
ever before but it's gone now this is

160
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,320
less of a semi-open world it is

161
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
semi-open but it's more of a directive

162
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,050
experience you know outside of the main

163
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,790
quest there are these excellent

164
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,220
challenge tombs and a ton of them and

165
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,470
even a few side missions that you can

166
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,130
pick up and some of the city sections

167
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,990
and those are welcome but well the

168
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,420
series has never been fully open worlds

169
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,640
if they were really innovating and they

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,860
were improving on each and every game in

171
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,500
the franchise this would have been the

172
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,860
perfect time for it to Ellis of my

173
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,810
school

174
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:35,690
why isn't he yelling hell doesn't kill

175
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,970
anybody that rope logic is just going

176
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,610
around his hand and then she like let's

177
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,529
go we should have been the game makes

178
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:47,510
some disappointing choices - from time

179
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,630
to time including actually robbing us of

180
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,260
sing Laura take up her iconic double

181
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,410
pistols look this is a huge missed

182
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,990
opportunity and since it's the last game

183
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,839
in this series it is insulting even you

184
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:11,240
like that I do I'll take two

185
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,329
why in god's name does this trilogy

186
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,129
think that the double guns are such a

187
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:19,040
bad thing clearly it does not have

188
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
problems with guns as is far more

189
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,559
effective to just use the rifle given to

190
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,589
you very early than her supposed a conic

191
00:12:27,589 --> 00:13:03,160
bow for this series there is no chance

192
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,639
now what you don't understand how long

193
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:20,809
it took you forget to bring a gun and

194
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:25,730
now to a nice it's ridiculous we all

195
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,529
wanted to see your guns and it would

196
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,439
have been this epic memorable moment a

197
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:33,170
thing that this game seriously lacks by

198
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,079
the way and I I don't know what the hell

199
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,480
was their problem why was it so hard to

200
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,620
include it

201
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,450
[Music]

202
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,019
all right no we honey baby honey sweetie

203
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,260
no look this is your big moment this is

204
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,240
when you're supposed to reveal the

205
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,600
double guns you think your friend is

206
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,209
dead the whole thing is over with you're

207
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,449
mad Johnny and this is the moment where

208
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,720
you become what we all know and love we

209
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,589
know you can do it baby

210
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:13,079
all right let's go Oh Oh Laura Laura use

211
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,709
both the weapons pull here here here

212
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:21,660
okay good good now as you ride you pull

213
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,050
both of them from your head whoa ready

214
00:14:25,050 --> 00:15:00,030
and

215
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:06,800
action

216
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,649
yeah there's an alright progression

217
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,040
system here you can craft various things

218
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,990
weapons equipment upgrades from things

219
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,850
that you find in the world and from

220
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,399
story elements but for Laura's upgrades

221
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,800
I felt a bit underwhelmed I know really

222
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,690
thought like any of them were too

223
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,420
exciting or really even that necessary

224
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,269
so know where the game really struggles

225
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,300
is mostly in its story by the time you

226
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,240
get to PI deity I think the game bogs

227
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,790
down a little this this sort of tribal

228
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,250
war doesn't really feel executed very

229
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,430
well it's muddled it's confusing it's

230
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,190
kind of boring on the boring side it's

231
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,940
worse yet is it's conveniently tied into

232
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,220
it's supposed to be the main bad guys

233
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,339
Trinity right this huge evil corporation

234
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,990
introduced in the second game and even

235
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,959
mentioned in the first game and recently

236
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,940
set up in the movie is supposed to be

237
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,370
wrapped up here after Lara goes after

238
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,950
them only everything having to do with

239
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,570
Trinity sucks

240
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,240
there is no real awesome battle with

241
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,610
them at the end in fact it almost feels

242
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,829
as if Crystal Dynamics just didn't know

243
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,170
what to do it it doesn't feel planned

244
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,570
from the very start of the franchise to

245
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,360
end up here I mean the main villain just

246
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,329
so happens to be conveniently connected

247
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,420
so closely with all this Mayan Incan

248
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,550
ancient civilizations so when you see it

249
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,500
it just makes no sense and it feels

250
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,200
thrown together at the last minute now

251
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,240
at least the relationship between Lara

252
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,820
and her friend Jonah is fantastic and

253
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,579
it's much more expanded here they do

254
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,310
manage to get some emotional moments out

255
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,660
of it we'll figure it out okay I promise

256
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,640
okay but first we're gonna help these

257
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,500
people get to safety and then we'll go

258
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:10,490
after the bomb you don't know that you

259
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,400
caused all this Mara not everything is

260
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,780
about you these people need us here we

261
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,890
can do good now showing that maybe Laura

262
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,290
is responsible for all this stuff the

263
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,179
game has great bits like these for you

264
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,910
listen to discover as well as some risks

265
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:40,270
and really awesome Jaguar hunts

266
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,980
thankfully miss Croft has done really

267
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,020
well herself so I gotta say she's

268
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,750
looking a little bit too faithful to her

269
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,780
original self these days let's go kick

270
00:17:50,780 --> 00:18:00,350
some ass she's everything else is super

271
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,520
high res oh shit that's just the cool

272
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,040
outfit system where you can actually use

273
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,020
the original play models from the

274
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,390
previous games though I do wish there

275
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,150
were more outfits to choose from for the

276
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,809
updated Lara to me I can already hear

277
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:20,240
people clicking away stop telling me how

278
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,770
to pronounce Laura

279
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,140
alright Laura Laura I know I pronounced

280
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,300
it wrong how this game doesn't even know

281
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,830
how to pronounce it her best friend

282
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,140
calls her Laura Laura said Laura gets

283
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,470
all the research paid off it's Laura

284
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,860
Laura Laura C said Laura

285
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,240
while she calls herself Laura I'm

286
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,200
Versace Lara Croft whatever at least

287
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,420
they at least they get her right the

288
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,090
character she's extremely smart even in

289
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,070
the segments which she's just a kid

290
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,080
which was a pleasant break from all the

291
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,870
killing adventure Lara Croft must this

292
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,130
was a really awesome sex holy crap I

293
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,660
wish I had this and I was a kid I wonder

294
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,110
why she's prepared just like a training

295
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,720
facility burial chamber job no it's not

296
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,520
yes disturbed in millenia yes it's kind

297
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,070
of ripping off the uncharted 4 thing but

298
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,080
it's still well done here she's using

299
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,470
like big words I never even heard of I

300
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,660
bet the pool thing could hardly see out

301
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,080
of that Chan front chan Franz she knows

302
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,660
what a Chan from is mid 14th century

303
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,690
barding Germanic I think too small for

304
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,799
my taste

305
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,080
smart she displaying her deepest

306
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,299
knowledge of history and archeology I

307
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,770
loved it it was really well done

308
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,320
bringing her character to complete life

309
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,390
and believability throughout the whole

310
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,160
game you said oh I see where she comes

311
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,140
from now I buy it it's really well

312
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,299
fleshed out it even plays with the lower

313
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,820
bid ask some questions about Laura's

314
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,070
mother which is kind of an interesting

315
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,679
flip since you know the game series has

316
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,500
mostly been concerned with her father

317
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,600
however much like the other missteps

318
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,970
here it never really goes anywhere with

319
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,390
that this is shame the strongest part of

320
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,850
the game in my opinion is the descent

321
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,830
like stuff you know the movie descent

322
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,419
these sections are in the game and

323
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,280
there's these sort of underground

324
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,919
creatures and culture is far more

325
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,870
fascinating than any of the other stuff

326
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,470
in the game

327
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,970
in fact I wish that that would have been

328
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,620
more of it just you would have been more

329
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,710
isolated and and more segments like that

330
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,600
and this would have given them way more

331
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,580
opportunities to innovate to like

332
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,740
putting in some sanity sections where

333
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,809
Laura might be like losing her mind just

334
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,820
on our own and seeing things

335
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,890
and doing like those Far Cry segments

336
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,440
where it's like playing with a brain

337
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,760
unfortunately again like I said before

338
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,330
it's all played way too safe in the end

339
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,670
throughout your journey of a maybe 13 14

340
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,700
hours there are many ups and downs but

341
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,040
ultimately I think the game does enough

342
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
right to warrant a purchase especially

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,200
if you played the other two by then it

344
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,690
may have even come down in price so

345
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,300
let's do our final verdict in fact let's

346
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,550
do a final work for a whole series so 9

347
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,920
out of 10 for the first game watch our

348
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
review on that if you haven't already

349
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,420
it's gonna be an 8 out of 10 for the

350
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,340
second game rise of the Tomb Raider and

351
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,320
make some improvements but again has a

352
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,530
little bit of story problems and now 7

353
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,270
out of 10 for shadow of the Tomb Raider

354
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,260
it could have easily been an 8 or a 9

355
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,540
however that lack of innovation and the

356
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,420
unfortunate in a weakness in the story

357
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,000
and the conclusion to this Trinity line

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,540
holds this one back from surpassing the

359
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:09,670
franchise's amazing debut there's no

360
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,900
it's easy

361
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,110
I'm not tomb raider you don't even feel

362
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,450
like you've defeated Trinity you just

363
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,610
feel like it was you know another

364
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,670
adventure in the middle of this story so

365
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,070
that I think is kind of what is holding

366
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,260
it back I mean it is polished to a tee

367
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,990
and you should still probably play it

368
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,300
but I just wish it went out with a much

369
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,750
bigger bang maybe whoever picks up the

370
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,820
series next will finally get to see Lara

371
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,670
Croft transform into her old self and

372
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,040
then if that happens sign me up

373
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,370
I'll take two of these please oh hell

374
