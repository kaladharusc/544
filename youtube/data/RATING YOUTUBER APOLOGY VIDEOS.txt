how I am going to record this video dude]

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,360
I, um...

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,200
wanted to make a statement on what I said.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,360
Time for me to review youtuber apologies.

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,240
That's right!

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,640
for some reason I thought this was a good idea.

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,320
You know

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,540
I made a few apology videos.

16
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,600
Just a few of them

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,680
just a couple

18
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,140
so I feel like I have the basic knowledge and skill to

19
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,260
determine what makes a bad apology video

20
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,320
and what makes a good apology video.

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,780
So sit back and learn

22
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,680
just in case you become a youtuber

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
and decide to mess up as well.

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
Like most of us.

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,720
Now

26
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,180
what makes the perfect youtuber apology video?

27
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,360
A couple things

28
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,660
there's couple things.

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,380
First off

30
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,460
the most important thing you need to start off with a sigh.

31
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,800
You need to tell your audience immediately that

32
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,720
this is a heavy video to make and it's an extreme burden on your shoulders

33
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,860
and there's a no way a better way to do that

34
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,420
but with a *sigh*

35
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,680
tHe SiGh.

36
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,480
No.2 what you wanna do

37
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,760
is shift blame

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,740
shift blame

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,360
whatever you could do, okay.

40
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,560
Never. Take. Responsibility.

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,200
If you take responsibility

42
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,960
then that's admitting that you're wrong

43
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
and doing that

44
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,300
that's just impossible.

45
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,340
Never admit that you are wrong!

46
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,600
Rule No.1 ACTUALLY

47
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,000
that's rule No.1

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,300
Rule No.2

49
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,200
Shift blame

50
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
Rule No.3

51
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Play the victim.

52
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,540
you.. you wanna make sure that

53
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,640
People know that, eh, this has been a great inconvenience to you

54
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,300
Ok

55
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,800
This has been a big problem for YOU.

56
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,600
So you might wanna bring up something like..ah...

57
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,960
lets say ah...

58
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,760
I'm getting cyber bullied.

59
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,740
[ His entire community has decided to cyber bully me]

60
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,180
Pewds: *chuckles*

61
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,740
Or if you're in deep trouble

62
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,500
What you wanna do is bring in death threats,

63
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,380
cause basically anyone that messes up on the internet

64
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,600
will get death threats.

65
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,540
It's just how the internet works

66
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,200
Unfortunately, there's gonna be that 0.01% of people that go too far

67
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
and that's an effective way to just diminish

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,760
every other criticism

69
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,180
The 99.9% of everything else that I, uh, people have to say

70
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,760
Excuse me

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,460
ahh!!

72
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm getting death threats, ok!!

73
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
Oh! I messed up.

74
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,140
Oh well,

75
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,700
A few selected people have decided to send mean comments to me

76
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,320
so

77
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,240
I think your point is invalid

78
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,980
Tana: That I take full responsibility for that

79
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,370
Every single one of your biggest
client told me how much money you've

80
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,600
taken from them, how much you've hurt them
like *summons cthulhu* say their names

81
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,270
like if you want me to I'll ask them to
ask you like I looked so why does every

82
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,840
single one of your clients tell me that
six months ago they knew that you were

83
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,640
gonna scam me that six months ago you
stopped working on all their stuff just

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,860
You know you can always say that you can take 100% responsibility

85
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,240
but that shifted completely  to someone else

86
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,380
that's always a sneaky move to make

87
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,720
May be say like

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
You know what, This was 100% my fault

89
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,600
That you were offended

90
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920

If this apology video was a fine wine... it would be a  uh chondeau 1955

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,700

verrryyy good

104
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,640
just to bring in context in case you weren't aware of this

105
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,410
I'm sure that most people know, but *deep breath* basically T. Martin

106
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,900
ran CS go gambling website he pretended
that he had nothing to do with it and

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:29,509
I can't stress enough I wish I loved
this video okay guys okay guys because

114
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,620
we're only eight seconds in and don't
really so much have happened first off

115
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,639
you start off with a dog that's an
amazing thing to do you want to bring in

116
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,400
like a pet something that everyone loves
everyone loves dogs and he doesn't just

117
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,310
bring in a pet he also has the pet for
advice I have no idea how I'm gonna

118
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,199
record this video and the dog even looks
sad I mean if this is not the perfect

119
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,540
apology video I don't know what is

120
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,700
if you can make it your pet looks sad for your apology video

121
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
you're done

122
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,800
hey edgar

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,650
he brings in the most beautiful sigh

124
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,100
i have ever heard

125
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,220
well diluted nostrils

126
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,561
his eyes are closed

127
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,620
he tells us you know what

128
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,880
this is me

129
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,000
THEN you have the
background

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,100
not only is he sitting in the goddamn mansion

131
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,370
you know if you scam
kids for money you kind of want to meet

132
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,860
seemed a little bit more subtle with it

133
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,229
maybe you want to not record in the

134
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:25,100
entrance hall

135
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,164
of YOUR mansion?????

136
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,800
how tall is that ceiling?

137
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,540
and on top of it all

138
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,920
HOW do you get your car

139
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,880
in the background of your video????

140
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,380
I'm sorry

141
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,040
how is that even possible

142
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,159
he does not only just get his mansion in

143
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,310
this apology video he gets his car in
there as well

144
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,160
a nice little cameo

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,629
I mean I don't even
know how I could possibly set up an

146
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,919
apology video to have my car in the
background it doesn't get better than this

147
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,110
*sigh* alright guys so well I'm gonna try
to make this as short and sweet as

148
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,650
possible I don't want to take up too
much of your time but first and foremost

149
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,840
I do want to say that I-

150
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,360
he started off
by saying that he doesn't want to waste

151
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,900
our time and then he proceeds to waste
our time with saying how much he loves his fans

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,490
I love you guys you guys
seriously mean the world to me you have

153
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,810
for the past 6 years that I've been on
YouTube and you honestly have changed my

154
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,400
life like every single day I get to wake
up and chase my dreams and follow my

155
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,113
passions and that's all been made
possible-

156
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,400
because I lied to you

157
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,016
*lil skratta*

158
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm sure he loves his fans just in the same way
you love your money just in the same way

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,110
you love your car and your mansion so I
don't necessarily think he's lying

160
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,570
I just think it's
it's a good way to start a video you

161
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,900
want to make sure that you tell your
fans how much you love them right off

162
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,340
the bat but and not acknowledge any
wrongdoing that you've done just that

163
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,050
you have just so much love to give now
my connection to csgo lotto has been a

164
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,070
matter of public record since the
company was first organized in December

165
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,840
of 2015-

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,340
however I do feel like I owe you guys an
apology I am sorry to each and every one

167
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,552
of you who vote like that was not made
clear enough to you

168
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,500
I love this cuz he's been exposed

169
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,660
that his company

170
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,620
he was the CEO of the company

171
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,520
but there-the

172
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,080
response is basically:

173
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,620
it was public record- it was just public-????

174
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,340
its YOUR fault get it??

175
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,830
shifting blame this is
what I'm talking about

176
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,120
it's YOUR fault

177
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm not being
disingenuous and I haven't been lying to you

178
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,340
it's your fault you know

179
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,360
you watch
this video

180
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,980
go boys all right so I'm

181
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,440
gonna open up my-

182
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
it's your fault for not
understanding how perfectly clear it is

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,760
that he actually owns his website

184
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,100
look at that well through a hot start baby

185
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
I mean this whole apology really is just-

186
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,300
it just seems like he's trying to cover his ass

187
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
legally speaking

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,220
and he even
says it himself

189
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,450
please also know that I

190
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,900
am committed to making sure that my
youtube channel as well as all of my

191
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,820
other businesses are in compliance with
the law

192
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,500
they're in compliance with the law everybody

193
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,480
a great response you know
if you've done something that people

194
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,980
don't like just just hit them with that:

195
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,100
it's a compliance with the law guys like

196
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,270
that ice cream of a kid it's a
compliance with the law so what was the

197
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,350
repercussion with this well not much to
be honest a lot of people thought you

198
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,400
know this would be a big scandal
possibly jail time people said there

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,290
will be millions of dollars in fines
what what was the verdict well basically

200
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,880
nothing I mean they got away with a
warning from the FTC and essentially if

201
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,670
this happens again they will be fined
roughly $40,000 which for someone like

202
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,590
tmartn seems like a pretty insignificant
amount so really nothing really changed

203
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,370
but you know it was in compliance with
the law as far as I can tell he saw

204
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,719
still uploading videos and I mean fair
enough I guess I

205
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,949
no there's no reason to dwell on these
things but I will always be grateful for

206
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:54,129
T Martin for the best apology video I
would rate this apology video

207
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:59,920
it's an 8.5 I know I just said it was
the best positivity of all the time but

208
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,100
it could be better
let's go through why we have of course

209
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,939
Laura Lee's apology video now I didn't
know who Laura Lee was apparently she

210
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:15,910
did some racist retweets it's just
confusing this video to me because I

211
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,779
don't understand what is going on does
it start does it honestly start like

212
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:32,410
this I wanna talk to you guys there is
no tears the video has just started off

213
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,610
if you want it like why Pat's here you
can start the video at any point this is

214
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,329
an amateur move what you want to do we
just say you want to make sure you get

215
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:49,949
to the point of the tear break then you
hit record you can't just you know what

216
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:55,300
what is this
12 seconds in and she said absolutely

217
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,029
nothing at all but rubbing her face in
strange way and fake wipe tears this is

218
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,439
this is good this is what I meant with
the white tee Martin's apology video

219
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,569
wasn't perfect because he didn't do this
this is what team I would miss missing

220
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,680
the thing is when you're going through a
controversy and the internet absolutely

221
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,910
hate you now I can speak from experience
although I never cried personally from

222
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,559
it because I'm not a child or a whamon
just joking you know it is a stressful

223
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,370
moment and I think that's what we're
witnessing here this is not an apology

224
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,620
this is a I'm trying to fathom what is
happening to me here I'm trying to

225
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,300
process what is going on right now this
is not an apology this is a reaction

226
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,600
video to the outburst that is probably
happening right now I imagine on Twitter

227
00:10:43,600 --> 00:11:06,320
or in different news media

228
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,420
why is this so comedic I you know you're
watching someone crying you're not

229
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,440
supposed to laugh right but I think most
people think this is funny I don't know

230
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:25,160
why is it the rubbing I'm not buying it
I don't think anyone is buying it oh

231
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,630
Jesus Christ what was that was that from
the nose or the mouth or what happened

232
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:40,440
yeah oh you know what I'm sorry this is
the perfect apology so some people

233
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,580
pointed out the reason why she's not
really crying and then sometimes you see

234
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,110
tears this is stressed tears so she's
not really crying because she feels bad

235
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,070
but she's crying because she's dealing
with all these emotions happening which

236
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:12,120
is kind of aligns with what I said
earlier as well disappointed not person

237
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,070
she practically hasn't said anything but
I'm better so but haven't showed any

238
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,690
reason for us to believe why I don't
know maybe I'm being mean now I can't

239
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,410
tell but I just find it interesting how
she starts off with saying I'm better

240
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm better now guys I'm cured look at me
I six years ago decided to retweet

241
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,500
things that were so vile what
laura-leigh does here is absolutely

242
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,730
amazing because when you mess up you
want to underplay it as much as possible

243
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,530
you want to make sure that people get
the lowest form of what you did so

244
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,520
instead of saying that she tweeted
something it was a retweet and she goes

245
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,700
very hard in on six years ago it was six
years ago how can you possibly still be

246
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,150
angry but that's the problem with these
things people don't really care when it

247
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:11,149
happened
stupid and I have no excuses here today

248
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,819
I'm not here to give you an excuse I
have no excuses I'm only here to say

249
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:23,329
that I've done this as well this is a
great you can't make excuses in your

250
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,129
apology video but it's just so damn hard
not to so what you want to say is I'm

251
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,779
not making any excuses but then you can
still sort of sneak excuses in there you

252
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,949
know it was six years ago I'm not making
any excuses it was a retweet

253
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:49,850
I'm not making any excuses I'm glad
there's captions here because I honestly

254
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:57,850
I don't know what she's saying

255
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,129
this goes on for four minutes and 44
seconds I can't I can't stay in this

256
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,879
video it's kind of like some things are
just so bad that they're good this is

257
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:19,579
just bad I'm sorry again there's no
excuse continues to give excuses alright

258
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:26,720
they've gotten her phone number they
attacked a child again I feel weird

259
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,500
criticizing this but I think it's an
important point it's not okay getting

260
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,160
death threats and I think everyone can
agree on that but it's not a valid

261
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,449
excuse either if you get death threats
take it up with a police there's no

262
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,500
reason to bring it up to your audience
as a tool of defending yourself I've

263
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,709
seen this done so many times even by the
media mainstream media as well oh we're

264
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,370
getting so many hateful comments or
death threats or people are being so

265
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,050
mean or yadda yadda yadda you know it's
sort of playing the victim mentality and

266
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,329
it's sort of saying that everyone that
criticizes me is doing this thing so

267
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:07,370
what was the replication here well
Lauren Lee was celebrating that she got

268
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,189
five million subscribers with the
hamburger

269
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:15,709
saying five and then the comments are
saying I'm confused on YouTube it says

270
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,870
4.4 meal
hmm this is very confusing yeah about

271
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,860
that boy do I have news for you
I think that's really the reason why we

272
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,779
got this reaction instead of an apology
because she was losing subscribers and

273
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,410
you know you got to pull the plug quick
you got to do something real fast if

274
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,970
that's happening I would rate this
apology video as solid set it's it's

275
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,100
pretty good
it hits most of the points that I

276
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,220
brought up earlier moving on we have of
course Logan Paul I'm kind of sick of

277
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,480
talking about Logan Paul but it has 53
million views this is the most viewed

278
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,320
apology video of all time which is
something I'm sure Logan feels very

279
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,230
proud of you know that was a joke but
it's true I've made a severe and

280
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,610
continuous lapse on my judgment the
funny thing I think the reason why I

281
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,440
love this apology video is that it was
you know he did the mistake of making a

282
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,060
tweet first when you're in the drama or
the internet is on your back you want it

283
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,440
you have to sort of assess the situation
you know it's just gonna grow bigger you

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,820
know are people not gonna just care for
a while like how far'd wage will go to

285
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,930
address this do I make a video
do I just make a tweet and Logan full of

286
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:33,040
thought I'll just make a tweet and it's
a beautiful tweet it's a beautiful thing

287
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm sure everyone's seen this but here
it hits all the good points as well

288
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,380
instead of apologizing just make sure
that you can tell everyone how great you

289
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,329
are as a person you know how this is the
first time you've ever made a mistake in

290
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,970
your life
for example that's a good way to start

291
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:55,060
off an apology video how you get so many
views on your channel that this drama

292
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,690
doesn't even mean anything to you that's
always a great way to acknowledge it as

293
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,399
well how you upload videos frequently
and how hard you work on those videos

294
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,360
which has nothing to do with the
situation and then say how much power

295
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,100
and influence you had I mean where's the
apology in this it's absolutely

296
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:17,559
beautiful and I think the cherry on the
top is the emoji a good apology ends

297
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,569
with an emoji and a hashtag otherwise
it's not either wise don't even talk to

298
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:28,130
me about apologies hashtag Logan for
life but the video is pretty good III

299
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,180
you know obviously a lot of people hate
Logan but I you know he addressed that

300
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,410
he what he did was wrong that's that you
know what else can you do a lot of

301
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,070
people have been commenting that he's
clearly reading from a script'

302
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,740
and all these things and oh he scripted
his apology and I get that but clearly

303
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,760
you want to have some idea of what you
want to say this is usually a pretty

304
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,310
important video and you want to make it
right so I don't really see that as an

305
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,400
argument obviously if it's completely
script that it comes across as

306
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,900
disingenuous and maybe someone else said
it but overall I think that's fine I

307
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,100
don't know maybe that's just my opinion
no I did not script all my apology

308
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,770
videos okay I've made a severe and
continuous lapse of my judgment a good

309
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,780
apology video sounds like someone else
wrote it okay what you want to make sure

310
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,470
it's a use language that you don't
typically use in your videos so it

311
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,850
people can know that it's not you who
wrote this apology someone else did so

312
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,830
you can read it out I made a severe and
continuous lapse of my judgement which

313
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,750
totally doesn't say I want to apologize
to the internet when you make an apology

314
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,180
video you want to make sure that you
apologize not to the people affected or

315
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,370
at least not first you want to apologize
to that people that are angry first I

316
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,570
want to apologize to the Internet the
internet apologize to anyone who's seen

317
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,110
the video the people who see in the
video most importantly I want to

318
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:00,170
apologize to the victim and his family
and then the person the most important

319
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,850
one put that last that's the last that's
the last thing on the list I don't

320
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,460
expect to be forgiven I will be better
thank you it's a pretty good apology

321
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,630
video I I don't have that much else to
say about it but it would be better if

322
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,700
he ended with look in for life this is
my personal opinion if I had to give any

323
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,500
feedback if you guys need any help with
your apology videos always reach out to

324
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,680
me I I'm here to help now we're running
a bit low on time so I want to just give

325
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,430
a quick shout out to some response
videos we have of course jenna Marbles

326
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:41,060
famous 47 minute long what happened to
my fish's video it's a forty seven

327
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,629
minute long
apology video it is the Atlas of apology

328
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:48,889
videos a lot of people use this apology
video as an example when someone makes a

329
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:53,210
oh they did this horrible thing and they
just did a two minute response video

330
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,610
with jenna marble did something simple
wrong and she made a 47 minute long

331
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,490
video so if you were actually really
sorry

332
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,419
you may would have made a five hour long
video you would have made a 24 hour

333
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,379
livestream apology video if you were
really sorry I've just been seeing a lot

334
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:12,769
of people make this argument which of
course makes no sense I do like this

335
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:16,759
video it's really funny and it's a I
don't know in a bizarre way it's not

336
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,889
really an apology video it's just Jenna
giving an explanation to what she did

337
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:27,440
wrong apparently she bought fishes and
the way she treated them instructed by

338
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,059
the general store manager was incorrect
so people in the internet got angry that

339
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,230
this is not how you treat the fishes and
then she made a video responding to ok

340
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,159
I've learned and this is how you do it
basically I am that's I think at least

341
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,580
what I got out of it which is nice you
know because a lot of people don't know

342
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,419
these things and if the store manager
gives you the wrong information it's

343
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:52,070
nice that she took a chance to give the
Internet the right information as well I

344
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,820
mean obviously most people don't know
how to treat a face I mean we also have

345
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,649
the famous fine brother response video
which looking back on it's kind of sad

346
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:04,659
isn't it you guys remember this that's
over what this all is has been so

347
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,049
overwhelming and what we've realized is
that we completely screwed up with how

348
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,879
we originally because I mean I feel bad
I met them I know they're nice dudes

349
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:17,659
I've only met them once so I can't say
like yeah they're amazing like they're

350
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:22,399
legit but I don't think they had bad
intention but this apology video is just

351
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:28,490
so awful it's just terrible it's the
worst apology video it seems it kind of

352
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,679
comes across as their scolding you you
know they basically try to copy right

353
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,149
that's right can we copyright they
copyrighted the world react because they

354
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:42,710
own the YouTube channel react so people
are like no you shouldn't try and

355
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,789
copyright react because then you can
just copy strike everyone else I put

356
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,629
react in the title this is actually true
but they're saying no we're not going to

357
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,820
do that
even if that wasn't your intention you

358
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,480
shouldn't try and do that so it's just
some saying no you're wrong you're wrong

359
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,000
we're not we would never do this you're
wrong the thing is they're not youtubers

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,080
they produce videos they don't sit in
front of the camera they have other

361
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,640
people sitting from the camera for just
this reason so things could definitely

362
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,360
have gone a lot better they seemed like
you're doing fine now anyway so it

363
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,450
doesn't really matter it's one of those
things that really shows you in my

364
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,620
opinion how important it is to make sure
you do an apology video the right way

365
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,810
because then you know if your intentions
are pure that doesn't necessarily come

366
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,460
across in a video so I think this is a
good example of that so for example we

367
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,470
have a YouTube channel youtube.com slash
react so we're trying to protect it and

368
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,400
not run the risk of losing our channel
name thanks to someone else getting the

369
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,900
trademark but just because we have or
might get trademarks doesn't mean we're

370
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,490
going to run around and start taking
down videos you dummies I guess I got a

371
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,690
watch mine I mean I can't sitting
criticize other people's reactions and

372
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,010
not acknowledge my own first of all I
mean what is that cup doing there could

373
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,570
you not have moved that goddamn cup it's
so annoying to me I don't know why

374
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,850
second of all already the posture I mean
I'm clearly in a very different position

375
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:17,760
here hi guys sorry this is not how you
make apologies you see I still have

376
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,110
things to learn I also look a bit angry
I don't look very happy I'm no I'm not I

377
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,740
wasn't happy no surprise I wasn't that
hello I wanted to make a statement on

378
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,990
what I said in my previous livestream
you probably won't believe me when I say

379
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,030
this but whenever I go online and I hear
other players use the same kind of

380
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:45,840
language that I did I always find it
extremely immature and stupid and I hate

381
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,020
how I now personally fed into that part
of gaming as well this is true I still

382
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,160
believe this but I haven't given anyone
a reason to believe this at this point

383
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,730
so it's kind of stupid to bring that up
in the beginning I would say the thing

384
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,809
that I said in the heat of the moment I
said the word

385
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,190
now because I said the heat of the
moment that has just become a meme that

386
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,749
has just transpired through YouTube it
was a heat of the moment guys come on it

387
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,840
was just a heat of the moment you know I
didn't mean for this just sound like an

388
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,299
excuse but a 100% comes across an excuse
so I never should have said that and I'm

389
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,070
not gonna make any excuses to why it did
because there are no excuses for it

390
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,629
accepts you you basically just made a
bunch of excuses for it you idiot

391
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:35,609
a very good way to thank okay that's how
I should have started it honestly

392
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:39,119
whatever it doesn't matter at this point
it's interesting looking back though at

393
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,369
how different I feel I'm really sorry if
I offended hurt or disappointed anyone

394
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:49,499
with all of this being in the position I
am I should know better yeah I keep I

395
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:55,799
keep forgetting about that part don't I
how long ago was this not bad it's not

396
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:02,669
bad I think I'm doing okay I owe it
crops in here because you know when you

397
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,029
make an apology video you want to keep
the cuts as low as possible because if

398
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,450
you just if you have it a consistent
cuts in it and people are just gonna

399
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,450
think it's fake it's kind of like you're
reading off a script or something like

400
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,309
that
kind of like the Laura Lee video has

401
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:23,339
constant cuts in it despite you know
it's just being said nothing in it but I

402
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,330
wanted to make sure that the last bit
came across properly because I thought

403
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,989
it was important to say that you know I
don't want this to keep happening

404
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:35,369
because obviously this is the second
time I messed up big time and I want to

405
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:39,299
make sure that people know that I'm not
planning for this to happen again yes

406
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:44,099
there was the thing with the tweet ahh! okay
that was insensitive but it wasn't maybe

407
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,729
as big of the Alessa tease that this at
least one of the things that I've

408
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:52,589
learned from my mistakes is that there's
a clear difference in what mainstream

409
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:58,830
media or news outlet wants to think
about something and what people actually

410
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:05,070
think about something I was given so
much advice that looking back on I am so

411
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,440
glad I didn't take if you want to make a
good apology video just be honest

412
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,909
don't try and think that you can trick
the internet because you can people

413
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:17,880
people are smarter than you think and
they'll see through the whole

414
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,920
it's bullsh a it's easy to for me to say
this looking back of course but it might

415
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,640
be a good lesson for everyone out there
that's it for YouTube apology videos

416
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,500
there's clearly a lot more of them but
we're way over time so smash like

417
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,000
goodbye!
