7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,100
We must not let T-Series reach 69 million subscribers before he does

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,800

Is that a gnome? Is that a GNOME?!

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,500
Uh..Guys. *breathes heavily*

58
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,400
I hate to say this, but *continues heavy breathing*

59
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
I think there's a gnome right there!

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
*sigh poor brad 1# and 2. good luck with him*

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Guys, it's not a joke. There's a gnome right there!

62
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,200
*CLAP*

65
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,000
I thought we had a- *pewds trying to speak English* whatever

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,900
I'm gonna find you all, okay?

67
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,300

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,200
How's it going everyone?

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,700
Poppy Harlow here for a SPECIAL PEW NEWS NEW SEG-!

71
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,680
Elon Musk just tweeted: &quot;Send me ur dankest memes!!&quot;

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,580
Wow. *thanks Brad1*

73
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,160
That is

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
EPIC

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Elon Musk billionaire, okay?! *Elon senpai*

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,000
is slowly, but surely tapping into the meme industry

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,220
There's potential rumors about him

78
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,600
funding catgirls *meow*

79
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,840
'cause it's genetically possible

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,300
BUT THEY &quot;LaCk FunDINg&quot;

81
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Maybe that's a new business he's looking into? (Thank You Elon Musk)

82
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,600
A lot of people seem confused why Elon is tapping into memes (wanna be pewds)

83
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,700
But surely, it can only mean

84
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,100
that there's a lot of money for the people in the industry.

85
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,000
So this is great news for everyone.

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How did they know?

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,100
&quot;Horoscope: You're probably breathing right now&quot;

88
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
&quot;People: Surprised pikachu face&quot;

89
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
How much could this meme be worth at this point?

90
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,700
Incredible.

91
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
Elon Musk: &quot;twitter meme&quot;

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
&quot;Twitter users:&quot; *pewds laugh*

93
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
I think what we're all wondering here is..

94
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,700
When is Elon Musk creating his meme account?

95
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,500
Elon Musk had a meme account already.

96
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,200
Why does Tesla's logo look so much like T-Series?

97
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,800
Okay guys. I'm tired of pretending I'm okay with this.

98
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
T-Series taking over my channel

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,200
and now Elon trying to take over memes.

100
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,300
And their logo types look very similar.

101
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,600
Guys *intense conspiracy theory*

102
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
*sad music* I'm scared.

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,000
For the first time, I'm not making any jokes.

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,620
I'm 100%... Terrified.

105
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,860
I know this is it.

106
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,560
It's over for me.

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,160
*ominous sound* This is it. YouTube finally got

108
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,380
what they wanted.

109
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,400
Just don't forget me when I'm gone. That's all I ask.

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,940
That's all I ask.

111
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,580

117
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,760
Hurry up and say it down in the comments.

118
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,720
I don't need to write that down, I'll remember it

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,800

This is a Spongebob tear meme

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,420
Okay?

136
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,900
See now, I'm getting angry

137
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900

They're everywhere. This is a Spongebob Tear meme

141
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm sorry, Elon.

142
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
You can do better. I know you can (aw &lt;3)

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,220
But, okay, you know, he's new in the business

144
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,480
So I'll give it a pass

145
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,800

Great months of cancer
*June 21-July 22*

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,820
It's also tearing the internet apart.

155
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,240
The internet has declared that this is the new Queen

156

All you needed is a girl dressing up with anime cosplay

159
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,900
Singing a song about Mia Khalifa diss track

160
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,040
And that's all it takes to blow up on the internet these days.

161
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
*disappointed sarcastic pewds*
Congratulations, everyone.
