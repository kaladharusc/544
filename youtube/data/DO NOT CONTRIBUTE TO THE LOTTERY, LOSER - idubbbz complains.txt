1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:13,440
oh shit I'm coming down with a bit of uh

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
some sort of throat thing I don't think

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,430
it's strep throat but I think it's some

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,470
sort of sickness but anyway the remedy

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,150
that I've heard countless times is

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,720
gargle with warm salt water welcome back

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,820
to another episode of Ian complains

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,739
[Music]

9
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:35,610
today I'm going to be complaining about

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,430
the lottery the lottery goes by many

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,100
names mathematicians like to call it a

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
tax on people who don't know how to do

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,930
math the lottery is mostly a tax on

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,879
people who don't know math and the

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,390
reason they don't know math is because

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,739
this video is meant to double down on

17
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,329
those statements because I do think it's

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,640
tax on poor people tax on stupid people

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,170
what I'm getting at is it's a way to

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,180
manipulate the people who are very

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,579
easily manipulated and take the money

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,680
away from them from people who really

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,600
need the money I want to start by

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,820
addressing the excuses people give for

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,740
why they contribute to the lottery the

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,100
first one is I play it just for fun kids

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,470
skip rope in the street for fun people

28
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,780
go to the movies and enjoy a two hour

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,390
long experience because that was a fun

30
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,490
thing to do the lines in some places

31
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,700
were hours long hours long you're paying

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,850
a fee to wait in a line for hours but of

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,890
course I mean that's not that simple

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,470
right because if you go on look at these

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,329
other clips these people are fucking

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:43,649
excited pay off my mortgage is like look

37
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,600
at their smiles just talking about the

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,640
idea that they what they would do just

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,040
imagining it's what the lottery Chairman

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,079
loves to say he loves to say you know

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,450
the great thing about lottery is it

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,759
allows people to dream and of course the

43
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,200
great thing about buying a lottery

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,689
ticket is the dream that it lets you

45
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,820
have how fucked of a concept is that

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,390
you're paying a fee to dream you're it's

47
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,670
impossible to dream otherwise the other

48
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,459
excuse is it isn't very much money well

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,560
if you look up the statistics on

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,170
the average lottery consumer in the US

51
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,720
they spend an average of about 200

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,330
dollars a year if I asked this average

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,950
lottery consumer will you be okay with

54
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,800
just giving me $200 at the start of the

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,270
year and your odds of winning the

56
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,099
lottery are exactly the same do you

57
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,450
think they'd do it they wouldn't do it

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,880
because it you're asking them for $200

59
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,950
the fact of the matter is you're still

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,140
giving away $200 each year

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,360
you're just incrementally giving it away

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm here to buy five thousand five

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,709
hundred and thirty-five Mega Millions

64
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,010
tickets you think she won guys you think

65
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,440
she won the jackpot huh you think you

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,630
know you basically spend the max amount

67
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,970
anyone would spend on lottery tickets

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,790
and it gets even worse for you the more

69
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,620
you spend what are you gonna tile over

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,450
these lottery tickets to see if any of

71
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,299
the 5,000 you purchased one people who

72
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,650
contributed the lottery think they're

73
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,750
investing geniuses because really the

74
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,690
risk is so low but the return is so high

75
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,090
what better thing than an investment and

76
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,040
and if it if it just goes away it goes

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,340
away

78
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,150
okay this is not an investment do not

79
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,250
call it that everyone watching this

80
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,440
video right now you are not going to

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,720
ever win the lottery I don't want to

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
even give credence to the idea that it's

83
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,859
possible to win the lottery you know if

84
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,079
you asked any mathematician they'd say

85
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,109
it's possible but it's improbable don't

86
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,239
use either of those words when describe

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,160
the lottery you know someone can tell me

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,430
that it's very statistically improbable

89
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,609
in that if you eat that moldy strawberry

90
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,459
you're going get a healthier gut after

91
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,049
listening to that I'm going to eat the

92
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,819
moldy strawberry every single time

93
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,790
because in my world I'm only envisioning

94
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,280
the dimension where when I eat the moldy

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,079
strawberry my gut is very healthy and

96
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,120
keeps me very resilient so don't use the

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,190
word improbable don't use the word

98
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,500
possible neither one of those are

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,870
accurate enough to describe your odds of

100
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,299
winning the lottery impossible

101
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,970
impossible are your odds you should

102
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,650
actually be embarrassed if someone finds

103
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,269
out that you play the lottery really

104
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,739
it's a lot more shameful if someone

105
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:17,789
finds out that you play the lottery

106
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,769
rather than they find out that you're a

107
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,780
furry because as far as I'm concerned

108
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,960
furries have an IQ 20 points higher than

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,540
any lottery players so you can take that

110
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,520
the bank guys oh and by the way everyone

111
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,710
seems to like to buy lottery tickets

112
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,500
once the Mega Millions has reached a

113
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,660
billion the Mega Millions 1 billion

114
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,960
dollars

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,410
1 billion dollars we say that one more

116
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,680
time 1 billion dollars everybody

117
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,110
billion billion dollars tonight 1

118
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,380
billion dollars I want to now buy the

119
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,120
quintessential quadrillions because now

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,600
it's you know Cougar aliens the odds of

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,820
you winning do not get higher the higher

122
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,950
the amount goes you're not going to win

123
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,190
it

124
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,890
it's just as illogical for you to be as

125
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,200
excited about Kylie Jenner's wealth

126
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,140
reaching 10 billion dollars it has zero

127
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,690
impact on you you will not ever see any

128
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,250
of that money so why are you getting

129
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,380
excited that she's getting richer I

130
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,970
think the main problem with the lottery

131
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,670
is that our human brains are not wired

132
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,820
to comprehend how impossible the odds

133
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,280
are of you know one in a trillion if I

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,110
tell you you have one in a trillion odds

135
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,360
your brain is actually gonna calculate

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,940
that as more around one in a thousand

137
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,790
one in 10,000 because a trillion it's

138
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,530
like what does that even mean so I'm

139
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,240
trying to really figure out a way that

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,510
you can convey the impossible statistics

141
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,240
to people because it's hard people have

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,130
tried to do it like I'll link some

143
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,100
sources down below of a couple of

144
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,290
simulations or statistics that allow you

145
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,390
to visualize it a little bit better I

146
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,800
went through a ton of different things

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,830
here's a graphic showing 10,000

148
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,890
different segments on a prize wheel you

149
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,900
know you're meant to see it and be like

150
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,610
oh that seems pretty reasonable then it

151
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,440
zooms out then it's like well fuck this

152
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,720
is not remotely reasonable and that's

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
only a hundred thousand ok that's only

154
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,890
showing a hundred thousand now we're

155
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,600
gonna talk about lottery advertisements

156
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,850
one of the tactics that they love to use

157
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,790
is use terms like believe believe in

158
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,740
something bigger this is all the shit

159
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,590
than you'd hear from a religion

160
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:36,400
[Music]

161
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,520
it's a religion it's only telling you to

162
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,430
focus on this infant essa mille singh

163
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,860
that will never happen to you rather

164
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,590
than the the monsoon of failure that

165
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,610
surrounds it

166
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,490
and if you don't you can't win it unless

167
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,780
you're in it you can't win if you don't

168
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,870
play you can't win unless you play how

169
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,490
many people have lost the lottery in

170
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,350
these lottery commercials they know

171
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,180
they're manipulating the dumbest people

172
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,340
on the planet so what do they like to do

173
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,380
they like to show you the dumbest thing

174
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,729
that you could possibly do with your

175
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,949
money like purchasing a massive

176
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,020
skyscraper in the middle of downtown New

177
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:20,020
York with a jungle on top of it

178
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,840
may the best dream win Super Lotto costs

179
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,940
from the California Lottery that is the

180
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,310
exact opposite thing that you should do

181
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,050
if you were to ever win a large amount

182
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,400
of money

183
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,070
[Music]

184
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,870
yeah that's what you should do have a

185
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,640
portrait made of yourself you fucking

186
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,280
egomaniac also worth mentioning are all

187
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,990
the influencers who promote the lottery

188
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,810
you have like iJustine I think she

189
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,730
promoted like scratch off tickets or

190
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,170
some shit like that

191
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,690
Guy Fieri I think promoted lottery

192
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,850
another tactic these advertisements like

193
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,950
to use is they like to make it as

194
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,110
relatable as possible to the average

195
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,090
person Rick said he hadn't really

196
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,890
planned on buying his Mega Millions

197
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,830
tickets until he noticed us looky chain

198
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,440
of events everything he bought the day

199
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,960
before the draw came out to even money

200
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,650
he stopped at the 7-eleven at 3740 Iowa

201
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,600
Avenue his first time buying lottery

202
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,910
tickets at that store people are gonna

203
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,800
make these dogshit correlations about

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,900
how oh yeah that one winner he got it at

205
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,630
a gas station oh yeah in fact I think I

206
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,100
know three winners who got it at a gas

207
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,350
station it's like yeah that doesn't mean

208
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,360
your odds are increased they also like

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,770
to manipulate by letting you know that

210
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,320
the lottery contributions go to

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,870
education but of course education is a

212
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,460
super vague word what does that mean

213
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,890
does it mean school supplies well these

214
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,050
promotional videos will make you believe

215
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,880
that your money's going directly to

216
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,830
school supplies Glenwood has been able

217
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,780
to purchase many of these supplies using

218
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,820
the enhancement funding it receives from

219
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,750
the California Lottery

220
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,940
but anyway education is this own compass

221
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,040
inquiry that could mean school supplies

222
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,860
building new parts of the school a

223
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,430
library new books paying the faculty may

224
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,650
be paying teacher salaries well out of

225
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,750
all of that it's mostly teacher salaries

226
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,430
and even out of the teacher salaries I

227
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,260
don't think it's that much all right

228
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,790
guys the Sun is setting so I'm gonna

229
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,590
wrap this video up the Lottery

230
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,960
scratch-off tickets basically whatever

231
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,150
you can buy at a convenience store I'm

232
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,400
not a fan of and I think you should

233
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,030
bully your friends and family who who

234
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,340
purchased them and if you don't feel

235
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,950
comfortable bullying them or it doesn't

236
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,780
line up with your principles then just

237
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,870
show them this video at least and let

238
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,670
them know that it's impossible

239
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,380
and check out what you could win for

240
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:48,030
tonight's Powerball it's not for you

241
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,920
it's not good for me it's a regressive

242
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,050
tax and punishes the poor you do not

243
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,660
want to contribute

244
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,649
bad you whore do I contribute to the

245
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,569
lottery team it's not it for you it's

246
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:14,129
not good for me it's not good for the

247
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:21,300
poor and stupid for the minorities do

248
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,000
