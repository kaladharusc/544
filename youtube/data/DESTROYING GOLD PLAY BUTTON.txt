1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
then get your mercy have mercy yeah

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,870
my phone is bent it really does Ben

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,139
it still works just fine so I had first time that that you guys literally break

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:31,680
on anything that it has no end up in the Hat has no honor in the side has no end

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,680
up in the summer is starting off right

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,909
getting that run has no end up in the sky

7
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,110
there's something about running in the summer maybe it's like the heat or like

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,280
just being covered in sweat but I love running in the Sun

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,790
hey happy summer everybody today is in fact the first day of summer

10
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,180
what will happen is it and it just could not be a better day to bring in the

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,750
summer is the fact that the godfather is always playing behind me distracting

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,890
this is the scene where Michael just escaped you but nearly got killed

13
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,230
found out afraid of the trait

14
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,520
in today's episode we kind of have a special presentation today to my

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,760
favorite creators are here in New York City and they're here like finishing up

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,900
this like wildly ambitious youtube video didn't work out for a very long time and

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,190
this video is to celebrate them getting their gold play button at least to run a

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,820
channel it's one of those ideas that when you hear like why didn't I think of

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,390
that

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,730
it's a dad my friend am his son lincoln and it's sort of like every episode is

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,630
that it's kind of a science experiment where they like take something they cut

22
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,330
it in half and they show you what's inside of it

23
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:53,170
Lincoln hello it's like him what's your favorite part of youtube music videos

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,520
and having fun and cutting things open

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,170
what's been the most fun video you've ever made the firework video because we

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,510
put 10,000 sparklers into one thin and if you like it off it makes huge fire

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,540
that's pretty fun and your dad make sure that you don't bring your fingertips off

28
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,780
yeah I was up on a mountain it work dad

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,330
thank you i try to be safe these guys are just wrapping up there like major

30
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,280
seriously epic movie and you need a couple shots of where you say I just

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,360
want to see maybe skyline or the river bridge something

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,860
ok blinking on a scale of 1 to Tony Hawk how good are you want to boost the board

33
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,610
ok

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,690
how does this differ from boosted boarding in utah ke cha

35
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,890
and there's the Brooklyn Bridge has promised

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,780
so this is the Brooklyn Bridge this is the Brooklyn Bridge

37
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,990
that's the manhattan bridge and then it's a win for bridge over there

38
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,620
the process of their videos like traveling the world with their gold

39
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,120
click to happen with the gold play button is like this world tour thing and

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,740
this is one of the shots that is New York City

41
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,420
miss crashed after my core it's really heavy it so it's 11 that I think it'd be

42
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,470
that heavy but

43
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,320

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320

68
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,880

Casey nice work my fault no big deal then over each other

77
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:06,059
honestly the board is filthy anyways it needs to be clean

78
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:09,869
blinking red that can't be a good time where's the controller

79
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:14,279
it is a bad news go through this we have three boost divorce

80
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,910
back to do

81
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,910
bad news is one of them is completely soaked

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,300
let's see if I getting water out of my shoes

83
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
my dance is full clip

84
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,020
my pants are drenched my shoes are completely soaked the boosted board

85
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,759
we tried to turn it on we got no love

86
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,790
it's like

87
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,530
I've never seen the light on the bottom flash before its flashing all kinds of

88
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,370
colors

89
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,420
there's literally water coming out of the motors here

90
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,140
boosted board down Linkin you and I'll ride boosted boards

91
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:09,650
your dad has no one up in the air dry my pants off you're making this is a paint

92
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,850
stripper teach so he's really high heat

93
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:20,270
- yes actually probably watch these parents there is a time to cut that it's

94
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,270
time I have a couple of ideas

95
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,900
I mean we have to use the angle grinder here

96
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,690
do you think that we cut it this way or we put it in down that way and just go

97
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,800
down probably down

98
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,690
ok what's been the place they might have to go on this spot

99
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,309
let's think this through

100
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:54,189
no hollow in the end of it

101
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,330
so in the truck we came up a little bit all you see is black has no

102
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,330
someone and turn the table

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,020
the table as well

104
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,069
everything should always have a real thinking where you went when your dad

105
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:14,069
that's it and over there right this is it they're gonna do it is that it you

106
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,909
have more things the shooter is just any credits just got this thing I'm ready

107
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,479
alright this is it it's gonna have and great weekend

108
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,479

109
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,110
yeah

110
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:43,930
oh we got it was it hot nobody was a black inside of their gold which fact

111
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,620
that we did it we don't Addison's guys huh

112
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,250
okay you tell blown up this year

113
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:58,720
all right last April you had 1000 subs are toxic and then in November you had a

114
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,500
hundred thousands of this November we hit a million august we had a hundred

115
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,930
thousand and then you had a million subs in November november and now we're

116
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,329
sitting here with 2.8 million right around there and it's what is it marched

117
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,670
no June June 2016

118
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,120

119
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,510
now but we've just been having fun making videos this whole time

120
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:29,350
