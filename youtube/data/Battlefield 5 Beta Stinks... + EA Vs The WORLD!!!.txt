1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,250
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,020
YouTube boogie2988 come on at your live

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,490
was again through the power of the

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,690
Internet and this is my weekly gaming

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,220
news wrap-up in which we just talk about

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,769
news about videogames so let's get right

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,190
into the games so the battlefield 5 beta

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,780
is over um you know it's our first

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,100
glimpse at this game which has been

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,080
fairly controversial a lot of fans are

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,300
expecting the worst and it looks like

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,760
based on the beta a lot of fans got the

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,369
worst even like huge fans like Angry Joe

14
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,439
who really believes in this game really

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,640
backed this game got to play early

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,320
concepts in this game after the beta

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,210
even he's pretty frustrated through this

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:47,280
game at this point now the clip you just

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,260
watched was angry Joe testing these

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,809
insane chat filters that got put into

21
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,309
place during the fat battlefied fil beta

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,550
if you entered the phrase white man it

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,350
got muted now you could say black man

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,870
asian man any other type of man in the

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,600
world but if you said white man the so

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,060
called algorithm mutant now all the

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,920
other usual suspect did filtered words

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,229
were there some really just stuck out as

29
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:10,650
weird

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,330
for example titanfall which is a

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,380
competing game the phrase DLC was muted

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,869
unless you put the word free in front of

33
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,820
DLC if you said free DLC that would go

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,650
through but any other type of DLC paid

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,860
dlc dlc and any free narration that

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,080
would get muted I personally think the

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
funniest one is the fact that they muted

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,490
the phrase not see in the game in the

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,290
chat filters considering it's a game

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,049
about shooting and killing Nazis as well

41
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,790
as playing as a Nazi from time to time

42
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,960
it's a world war 2 game so yeah and all

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,979
of this just kind of fed into the

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,329
controversy that this game was being

45
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,729
designed by sjw's and people who were

46
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,020
very very progressive so progressive

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,790
that they're willing to spoil their own

48
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,890
video game in the name of progress and

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,869
it really does seem like that maybe what

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,579
happened here but as a video game player

51
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,110
who doesn't really care about politics

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,240
very much here's what I will say the

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,950
actual gameplay itself the actual

54
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,820
firefights

55
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,070
were very very decent it pretty much

56
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,689
played like a battlefield game a very

57
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,369
chaotic battlefield game though I think

58
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,170
battlefield one was considerably better

59
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,030
and when it comes to like the polish of

60
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,440
the game it doesn't look like it's very

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,250
polish

62
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,140
for example one of the progression perks

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,340
that you can get for one of your weapons

64
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,400
is called fast bullets because I don't

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,270
know why they wouldn't call them high

66
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,220
velocity rounds high velocity rounds

67
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,950
exist what is a fast bullet I don't know

68
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,709
why why what you've used high velocity

69
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,410
rounds in the game before and rather

70
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,209
than using like attachments to level up

71
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,920
your guns and stand here going through

72
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,530
this weird pert tree for your guides

73
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,970
it's really bizarre a lot of people

74
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,350
noted that the whole cosmetic

75
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,000
progression system as well some of the

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,290
cosmetics that you can even get in the

77
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,540
beta seemed very weird and we talked

78
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,709
about that during the whole battlefront

79
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,810
2 thing that nobody wants a pink Darth

80
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,090
Vader and that's true and this game is

81
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,069
just filled with pink Darth Vader's when

82
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,890
it comes to the cosmetics including

83
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,000
prosthetics and other just weird stuff

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,709
you would not have expected to see on

85
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,049
the battlefield during you know World

86
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,390
War 2 so EA has promised that they're

87
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,620
gonna patch some of that stuff out and

88
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,700
it won't be in the final version of the

89
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,470
game then we won't get too weird with it

90
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,209
they were kind of going fortnight with

91
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,489
their own only game won one game should

92
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,049
do that and that's fortnight and then it

93
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,030
does look like based on the beta a lot

94
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,200
of people who played this beta

95
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,570
extensively and know the series a lot

96
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,400
they say that it seems very light on

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,109
content when it comes to the number of

98
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,820
guns that you can unlock the number of

99
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,470
maps the number of game modes and stuff

100
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,730
like that and of course it is a beta

101
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,459
that stuff can change by November but

102
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,600
we'll just have to wait and see but

103
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,519
based on the beta impressions this game

104
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,470
seems to have very weird cosmetics a

105
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,500
very weird political agenda and a light

106
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,709
on content might be it might be a pass

107
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,269
now this week Cydia is sponsored by the

108
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,430
folks over at Verve who by the way just

109
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,859

110
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,660

111

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,829
like my hero academia attack on Titan

113
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,560
one piece and a heck of a lot more but

114
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,829
they just added a bunch of amazing

115
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,910
Nickelodeon shows to the lineup as well

116
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,380
if you want to be watching some old

117
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,959

legend of the Hidden Temple it's all

124

there as part of the NYX flat channel

125
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:17,700
which is part of the first surface but

126
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,200
along with NYX flat you also get

127

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,470
in one place

131
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,120

138
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,630
a favor go check it out will you now one

139
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,010
of the games have been most critical of

140
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,870
this season would be the new Call of

141
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,850
Duty and I have to say I'm not a huge

142
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,860
fan of the franchise I tend to do the

143
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,720
single-player stuff and not much else in

144
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,670
it dabble with zombies a little bit and

145
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,710
never play the multiplayer but I did

146
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,020
take the time this week to play the open

147
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,580
blackout beta I gotta say wow I was

148
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,080
really impressed now in order to play

149
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,580
this beta you had to pre-order the game

150
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,170
which is definitely not something I'm

151
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,030
all about so fortunately one of my

152
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,800
friends did pre-order the game and I got

153
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,270
to sat down and watch him plate for a

154
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,130
while I played it myself I watched a few

155
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,020
other people play it and I have to say

156
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,330
as far as battle Royales go yes it's

157
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,830
just another battle royale but this is

158
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,900
probably one of the better ones I played

159
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,510
it was smart and funny and different and

160
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,080
just kind of interesting I good job I am

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,210
surprised Activision I have to say that

162
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,800
if this is a standalone free-to-play

163
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,660
game or maybe for like 20 bucks with

164
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,340
like no microtransactions in it for the

165
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,900
20 bucks this would have been incredible

166
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,160
this would have been an absolutely

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,930
amazing thing I think it might have very

168
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,460
well competed with fortnight it might

169
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,070
have killed fortnight now it is a $60

170
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,080
game with premium editions and

171
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,150
microtransactions built right in from

172
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,600
the get-go so mmm I'm still gonna be

173
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,190
critical of that but as far as gameplay

174
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,620
goes I think it's worth checking out I

175
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,570
hope it goes free-to-play that would be

176
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,130
really smart but that's just my opinion

177
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,630
of course I always want to hear your

178
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,160
opinion so if you took the time to watch

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,570
somebody play The Blackout beta if you

180
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,400
played The Blackout beta let me know in

181
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
the comment section below like I said

182
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,240
this is not exactly my forte this isn't

183
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,040
my bailiwick I I'm not really good at

184
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,120
these console shooters that are

185
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
particularly popular I like to dabble

186
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,820
with them I like to play the

187
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,280
single-player no I might even buy this

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
one if the reviews are good we'll see

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,280
and now let's talk about everybody's

190
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,820
favorite topic loot boxes because things

191
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,680
just got heated up and it's now a

192
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,790
worldwide battle vs EA good luck world

193
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,110
now I've talked about this in a previous

194
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,390
episode but to get you caught up the

195
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,490
folks over in Belgium decided to make

196
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,260
loot boxes in video games illegal

197
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,650
because they determined them to be

198
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,509
gambling and they don't want gambling in

199
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,650
their video games especially because

200
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,660
kids are playing him and I think they

201
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,919
were right about that I think that's a

202
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,020
very smart and good decision we've seen

203
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,970
a lot of different companies react in a

204
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,360
wide variety of ways to this news but

205
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,009
one of my favorite responses was from 2k

206
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,210
games who actually put out this

207
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,669
statement in Belgium asking Belgian

208
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,070
citizens to appeal to their government

209
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,080
to get loot boxes put back into their

210
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,360
video games like you know I can only

211
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,190
imagine the crickets on this one I can't

212
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,860
who who contacted their representative

213
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,930
to ask them to add gambling back to

214
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,169
video games when how what what 2k what

215
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,300
and most of their companies like 2k did

216
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,770
pull that stuff out of their video games

217
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,780
Activision most notably with overwatch

218
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,539
but one brave company decided to stand

219
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,240
up for robbing the consumer for every

220
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,060
dime they're worth and defy Belgium law

221
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,820
and that's the folks over at EA they

222
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,680
decided to escalate and as we know from

223
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,900
the Batman movies escalation is never

224
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,820
good long story short the folks are

225
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,410
ready a decided they were making far too

226
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,570
much money from loot boxes in their FIFA

227
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,400
series in Europe so they decided to not

228
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
take them out of the Belgian version

229
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,539
because they're making too much money in

230
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,979
Belgium so now they were under

231
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,139
investigation by the Belgian government

232
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,210
in response to EA deciding to defy the

233
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,909
law the folks in Europe 15 different

234
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,530
countries in Europe have decided to band

235
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,680
together to fight microtransactions and

236
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,729
loot boxes in video games so oops EA

237
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,460
that was that was pretty bad decision so

238
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,510
that's the boy we're at in the gaming

239
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,060
industry now EA is willing to fight in

240
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,310
court for the ability to continue to

241
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,159
earn money from the FIFA series in terms

242
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,630
of micro transactions they must be

243
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,860
making so much money they would rather

244
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,930
have a expensive legal battle than to

245
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,470
give that up

246
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,530
so FIFA players buy a lot of micro

247
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,880
transactions that's that's what we

248
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,380
learned from this alright guys I hope

249
