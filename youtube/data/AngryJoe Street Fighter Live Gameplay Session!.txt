24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,710
say and he's jacked just like Joe and

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,310
Alex dog tags they're something to

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,460
aspire do anybody who knows the Lord

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,030

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,520
yeah all right so this is you know the

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
multiple views that you can see the

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,740
multiple views for the guy home alright

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,159
nice nice nice okay moving on here is

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
our updated a Honda he guy was free to

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
you guys who pledge at Street Fighter

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,740
and world warrior he Honda's free we

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,380
just added him thanks to you guys I had

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,750
him squat a little bit more get lower

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,689
with this hundred hand slap so I think

38
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,990
it looks pretty good and maybe I might

39
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,829
go with a little bit clearer on the

40
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,290
hundred hands yeah yeah a little little

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,420
little effect there but I kind of like

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,009
it your move its move moving super fast

43
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,469
so maybe doesn't need it but there it is

44
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,540
and he's got his bathhouse base you can

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,740
see there

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,149
[Music]

47
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,220
the floor yeah if I could get you the

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,640
other one but okay and then so many of

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,620
you said we would needed to modify the

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,650
Blanca pose we did so and so I like this

51
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,270
pose a lot more now this is work in

52
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,220
progress we're actually gonna change

53
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,160
this one up a little bit more we want to

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,440
put the shackles on him cuz otherwise

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
his mama ain't gonna know who he is yeah

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
yeah you lord

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,810
Street Fighter Lord people know what I'm

58
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,360
talking about alright so it just gives

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,130
him a little bit more of a dynamic pose

60
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,319
he's just looking sweet man in that your

61
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,450
face oh yeah yeah one of your faves and

62
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,160
in the game he's super awesome he's

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,640
trollee

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,640
he uses his lightning to watch the

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,819
larger defenses super-fun and then and

66
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,280
then this one's super excited we just

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,910
unlocked

68
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,989
mr. dhalsim wahoo he is looking sweet we

69
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,600
went with yoga our yoga flavor yeah like

70
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,910
that pose oh yeah and he's floating we

71
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,530
wanted to get a little bit of that that

72
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,560
floating action up in there you know at

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,450
first I wanted to do a little bit of

74
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,549
stretchiness in there if maybe one of

75
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,680
the arms stretches over and has him blow

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,100
fire through one of his fingers but it's

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,709
a little too much but this is super

78
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,630
excellent so again all of these are

79
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,480
sculpts in progress work in progress not

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,820
approved by Capcom yet so this may

81
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,370
change they may have their own edits to

82
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,660
make but as you can see we've got a

83
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,120
little bit of the elephant's stage base

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,250
on there guys

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,170
boom yes so our highest request was more

86
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,310
dice so we're working on that and you

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,950
know I've got a pole that I'll be

88
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,140
putting up as an update on the

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,540
Kickstarter to determine whether you

90
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,299
guys would like rounded dice like this

91
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,780
or sharper dice like you'll see that

92
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,989
we're about to play with right now see

93
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,070
and you'll see when we play with it

94
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,819
[Laughter]

95
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,609
shadaloo dies now work in progress I

96
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,500
don't know if we use those bison wings

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,229
exactly like that right so it's super

98
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,330
skinny though do you see how thin it is

99
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,759
it's kind of hard to etch those in so we

100
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,350
might have to fill in those gaps and

101
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,590
actually color in the the wings or we'll

102
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,360
just go with the normal meter so we

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,310
don't confuse people because sometimes

104
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,970
can get easily confused but they look so

105
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,370
so cool and if you're playing the boss

106
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,500
you don't have to use the same dice as

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,229
these other peasants so I hope you guys

108
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,139
enjoyed those little reveals we'll be

109
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,050
using a cycle yeah well it actually

110
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,460
because it's purple it actually can

111
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,250
apply to not only m.bison but I'm so

112
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,199
cool so I thought that that was a pretty

113
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,099
cool way it worked out so yeah that will

114
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,340
be coming you know soon that's all I can

115
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,000
say about it and then I've discovered

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,430
Google Forms some of you in the comment

117
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,590
section have kind of helped me figure it

118
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,900
out and so we'll be doing some fun

119
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,259
backer poles like for example sharp dies

120
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,229
rounded dies and things like that

121
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,440
alright so what do you guys want to see

122
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,190
man what do you want to see we're gonna

123
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,169
plant planted out too too much here let

124
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,990
me actually get you a large view so I

125
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,970
can start showing off things I promised

126
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,090
you I'd show off some some cards so

127
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,620
we'll go in this large of you real quick

128
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,970
and you know here's a deck of cards let

129
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,889
me bring this camera closer to me

130
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,919
without knocking the whole thing down

131
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,060
now keep in mind a lot of this art is

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,210
not final still work in progress so

133
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,659
don't judge any of the art and I know

134
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:06,240
it's a little bit harder to see now

135
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,000
because I've sleeved my cards one thing

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,430
one big feedback we got is the text is

137
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,050
way too small and we agree with that

138
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,150
this was just kind of put together

139
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,889
quickly so that we can see what the

140
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,960
cards would look like in their final

141
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,210
templates so this text is going to be

142
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,620
much much bigger because I want to be

143
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,100
able to see my game

144
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,680
banning is important yeah and over time

145
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,410
I've gotten old and so I'm an old man

146
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,480
now but yeah so just to kind of show you

147
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,320
a deck breakdown so here one two three

148
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
four five six

149
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,360
these are sagat's six events right and

150
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,100
for many characters their events are all

151
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,740
unique in sagat's case he has two of a

152
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,820
single one called

153
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,210
angry scar which just symbolizes him

154
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,130
remembering when he got his scar and it

155
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,380
sort of powers him up so there's that

156
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,480
we've got mocking laughter because

157
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,210
everybody knows you know socotra will

158
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,210
laugh at you if you are pathetic the

159
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,530
need for revenge

160
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,250
obviously he's driven by his goal to to

161
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,870
get a tree you again one of these days

162
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,300
so that's in there we have eye for an

163
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,620
eye this is our work that's probably

164
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,780
gonna give a place he's attacking a goal

165
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,270
Hibiki which is actually Dan's father

166
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,610
and that's actually how he got the scar

167
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,550
Ryu did not give him the the gouging eye

168
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,670
he just gave him the scar on his chest

169
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,130
and so this has an event card there and

170
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,410
then imposing shadow just kind of

171
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,880
showing you how big and intimidating

172
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,620
Sagat is versus a huge yeah so all of

173
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,450
these have really thematic and special

174
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,280
game events and that's why I'm saying in

175
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,370
this game not only are we simulating the

176
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,470
the one-on-one fights like you see in

177
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,200
the video games but also the story that

178
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,550
is around yeah so there's there's your

179
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,120
six events okay and then we'll go ahead

180
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,940
and and then you break down the attacks

181
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,450
into their different categories strike

182
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,600
special projectiles so we got that big

183
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,750
old chunk there and then there are

184
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,420
what's called utility events now these

185
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,090
are the utility events yes some of this

186
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,640
is original art some of this is art from

187
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,610
Capcom themselves some of this is owed

188
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,100
on art and some of this is placeholder

189
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,620
art so again please you know forgive

190
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,729
that it's low early so in this case what

191
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,830
is in their utility events well every

192
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,660
character will have two cards for their

193
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,729
super

194
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,440
you knows what super combos are if

195
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,639
you've played some recent street

196
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,250
fighters this is sagat's his is a tiger

197
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,529
genocide so it has different abilities

198
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,399
like a charged property this one has you

199
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,690
know so they'll have different keywords

200
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,930
that give them flavor and

201
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,550
differentiation then there's two focused

202
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,079
attacks notice there's no art for the

203
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,300
focus attacks but that will also have

204
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,970
unique art from Sagat performing is

205
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,740
focused attack that is from Street

206
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,320
Fighter for it which is a paint like

207
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,410
effect and what our focus attacks well

208
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,360
these are mainly used to punish people

209
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,389
who are blocking too much you know they

210
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,040
just I don't like to play counter attack

211
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,380
just block block block play a focused

212
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,970
attack it'll go straight through there

213
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,040
their you know their armor their blocks

214
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,800
and cause them some damage and then

215
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,079
these are a very unique thing to our

216
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,699
game this is kind of what helps

217
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,829
facilitate the game system these are

218
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,769
called baits and I think the text is

219
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,870
flipped here but it's this is just early

220
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,360
here and the hard work will be different

221
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,459
this is a Ken you know kind of baiting

222
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,760
his opponent but um so this allows you

223
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,670
to play around with your opponent so for

224
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,880
forced them to move and disadvantage you

225
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,449
know in positions to set up say for

226
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,630
example you know he's here and you want

227
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,519
to try to knock him into this rock then

228
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,709
you would bait him and you would get to

229
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,899
move in one space and then and then you

230
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,730
can set up you know pushing him into the

231
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,100
rock that's one way to play it one way

232
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,069
to play it is if you know it's obvious

233
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,160
that you're gonna fire a projectile then

234
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,500
you play one of these facedown and then

235
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,420
when you reveal it haha baited you and

236
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,630
then they wasted their their

237
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,279
counter-attack against the projectile

238
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,230
and then you really put your projectile

239
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,050
down next and then they get hit with the

240
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,730
projectile or you can just bait them

241
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,490
twice get a bunch of meter here get a

242
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,839
bunch of meter the other way they're

243
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,670
used is you can build meter from the

244
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,699
baits and and so you can get to your

245
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,730
supers and your ultras now where are the

246
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,440
ultras the supers are here they're two

247
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,790
cards so they can get knocked out of

248
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,709
your hand the ultras are actually going

249
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,649
to be on the character cards now this

250
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,180
obviously a play test prototype

251
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,949
character card for Sagat but they're

252
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,050
written right here and it'll be all nice

253
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,980
art one one part of it will have his

254
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,170
full body his bio a little bit of a

255
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,600
story and then the other will have his

256
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,350
stats and the ultra okay so that's what

257
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,879
that is so you've got your six events

258
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,040
here you've got one two three four five

259
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,740
six seven eight eight utility events

260
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,410
which again was to focus attacks to

261
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,589
supers and for baits and then your six

262
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,619
events and then you've got a the

263
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:27,319
distribution of attacks now in order to

264
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,480
give each character their flavor on top

265
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,579
of unique events because this kind of

266
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,470
gives your character there their flavor

267
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,089
and their different playstyles

268
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,420
but supporting that is a number of three

269
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,179
different attack types so in sagat's

270
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:44,209
case you'd imagine that Sagat is what we

271
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,309
call as owner in in the fighting game

272
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,589
community and so look at how many

273
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:50,689
projectiles he has and we can count them

274
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,660
together we go one two three four five

275
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,009
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

276
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,980
twelve projectiles so that kind of tells

277
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,110
you what kind of characters to God is

278
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,120
and he's kind of zoning and he's got a

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,420
lot of projectiles and what are these

280
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,790
differences you see here yellow dice red

281
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,769
dice well red dice is just the normal

282
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,389
damage you just throw your dice and

283
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,929
you're good to go

284
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:19,490
yellow dice allows you to add a dice if

285
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,769
you spend some meter to e exit it's an

286
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:24,379
enhancement and then you have different

287
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,540
ranges on these different you know

288
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,509
projectiles and notice you can start to

289
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,929
combo them so you've got this red links

290
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:37,279
into that Reds ego Tyger Tyger Tyger and

291
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,509
really picks off Joey and Alex and then

292
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,269
these have range bonuses where you'll

293
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,730
get even more damage if you fighter them

294
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,499
off at a certain range and I can't see

295
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:49,699
you here because this text is a little

296
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,279
too small but again I said we'll

297
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,699
increase that text now at the bottom of

298
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,310
the card you'll get the

299
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,010
terr attack so this can counter-attack

300
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,800
against a projectile and we reduce the

301
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,260
text we improved it a lot and what that

302
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,750
allows you to do is if you're as owner

303
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,670
obviously you're pretty good at stopping

304
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,680
you know others owners and so you're

305
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,750
throwing out fireballs and becomes a

306
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,390
fireball war you can counter projectiles

307
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,920
so you're a little bit better than that

308
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,950
so your options as as owner is you got

309
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,560
12 12 of these and then what are some of

310
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
his other attacks well of course you

311
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,370
break those down into strikes and

312
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,470
specials so you have seven of each of

313
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,050
these so in this case he's got tiger

314
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,750
uppercut tiger uppercut tiger knee crush

315
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,140
more uppercuts and some knee crushes so

316
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,000
Tiger uppercuts and tiger knee crushes

317
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,980
which have their own effects they've got

318
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,810
their own keywords and they've got their

319
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,390
own text abilities so a lot of different

320
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,339
flavor that's how we continue to make

321
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,180
each attack unique and then over here

322
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,450
sagat's famous low kick which which can

323
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,029
reach pretty far tiger carry which is a

324
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:02,750
throw standing roundhouse and again some

325
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,800
of this is placeholder our elbow Tiger

326
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,080
rage a lot of these different things so

327
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,240
a lot of these are directly pulled

328
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,480
directly from the fighting video games

329
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,330
and some are gameplay purposes where we

330
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,160
need to you know like for I think

331
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,610
example like Tiger no low kick is in

332
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,870
there standing around house is in there

333
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,130
pretty much all of this is in the game

334
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,020
like - Tiger elbow right that's maybe

335
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,390
not you don't press a button for a tiger

336
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,220
elbow but it's here for gameplay

337
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,160
purposes because so god needs some close

338
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,130
up attacks notice he has a range of one

339
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,940
there he can't just be zoning all day

340
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,070
long because if you know to see God he's

341
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,839
owns owns owns then he gets in and he

342
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,870
rips you apart with his you know Tiger

343
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,600
uppercuts and Tiger knees all right you

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,440
want to address some of the questions

345
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,589
now get out there yes all I go back to

346
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,560
the large boobs yeah all all projectiles

347
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,020
counter projectiles so it's not all

348
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,700
strikes counter strikes all specials

349
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,850
counter specials so there's there's no

350
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,640
variation there all of the moves with

351
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,020
the same title or identical

352
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,640
so I mean there's a difference between

353
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,779
like a high Tigers or high Tiger and low

354
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,070
Tiger but those are different but every

355
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,690
tiger uppercut will be the same as every

356
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,180
other Tiger uppercut and there was one

357
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,709
more that would probably be good to

358
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,700
answer I don't remember what it was but

359
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,810
go ahead and feel free to ask some

360
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,740
questions especially while they're

361
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,180
playing I'll look at chat and make sure

362
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,830
that we get any of your concerns

363
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,600
addressed so people like Honda don't

364
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,520
have actual projectile moves but so if

365
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,930
you if you're familiar with the game

366
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,550
Honda has is you know we always probably

367
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,130
have his sumo sumo torpedo type thing

368
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,339
and so they have moves that act as

369
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:56,750
projectiles but like most some of the

370
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,580
characters like throw themselves at each

371
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,320
other and that you know we take some

372
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,399
liberties here and make sure that the

373
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,520
gameplay works

374
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,160
um all right so go back to the close-up

375
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,560
view here I'll show you some beeps moves

376
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:17,870
so we'll go through some of these so

377
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,600
notice that mashing flat here is

378
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,899
considered a projectile now we also call

379
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,940
projectile rushes but I thought that if

380
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,040
we just drop the word rush it's less

381
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,230
confusing now Street Fighter faithfuls

382
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,820
will be like your ax yep

383
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,770
some games just don't have projectiles

384
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,480
and we like we know we know we know yeah

385
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,880
it's not that's just it's a functions as

386
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,290
a projected because it counters a

387
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,670
project because it can counter and

388
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,670
project that exactly and so that's kind

389
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,870
of how how that will work

390
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,190
same thing with Vega because Vega

391
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,140
doesn't have that that kind of options

392
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,970
but Vega has some really cool stuff with

393
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,700
his mask and his claw that we put in the

394
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,100
game

395
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,420
yes there's a rowboat there's a very

396
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,850
detailed rulebook for the game your

397
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,740
favorite character to play and deck ah

398
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,829
Honda a Honda is really fun

399
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,260
camis cami is one of those characters

400
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,120
that has a really really high skill cap

401
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,069
because you are you talking about we

402
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,750
don't know yeah yeah she's just been

403
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,839
revealed as the 1 million goal and it's

404
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,350
so fun because she she has hand

405
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,990
manipulation and she combos better than

406
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,610
anyone the game she's her combos can be

407
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,590
harder to set up but when you get a man

408
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,190
do they hurt so I'm a big fan of love

409
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:42,170
cami as well all right so let's go ahead

410
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,270
and and in order to play some of those

411
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,040
guys I actually need to go grab some of

412
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,270
the expansion and stretch girl character

413
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,680
decks that we have over here they're

414
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,940
gonna be in a little rougher form a

415
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,850
little uh play test form pretty much

416
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,160
final but won't have ours you don't give

417
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,580
me one second as I go get that I'm gonna

418
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:08,700
play as Honda say count

419
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,190
yeah so if your question about Ryu

420
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,929
throwing a projectile and then Ken

421
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,850
trying to counter-attack with a sure you

422
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,549
can because sure you Kansas special if

423
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,260
you played this special counter-attack

424
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,389
against a projectile it would do nothing

425
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:23,950
and you would take the damage you have

426
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,510
to guess you have to anticipate their

427
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,799
attacks correctly since attacks your

428
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
play face down sort of like a

429
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,110
rock-paper-scissors game of Yomi but you

430
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,380
gotta you gotta guess the correct attack

431
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,889
all right so here we've got Honda that

432
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,779
was recently unlocked and we've got

433
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,620
guile that was recently unlocked and

434
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,289
there are there there are so many decks

435
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,210
laying around this house so forgive me

436
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,559
if we're using a little bit older

437
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
version of these and I go oh no no

438
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,429
that's not how it works like say for

439
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:56,950
example if I start losing yeah oh you're

440
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,029
cheating

441
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:01,419
a lot of House Rules is what I thought a

442
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,029
lot of House Rules just saying that to

443
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,679
make more funny we don't how to do this

444
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,279
you know we are very yes and the game

445
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,110
can be played six way in a variety of

446
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,960
different modes 2v2 six person

447
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,110
free-for-all 3v3 it's a lot of fun okay

448
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,340
so let me just make sure he's got a

449
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,980
little stuff one two three four five six

450
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,230
we've got six advanced there is a stunt

451
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,909
mechanic just like in the game yeah

452
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:26,590
there's done and there's some characters

453
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,720
that have significantly better stun you

454
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,570
know it's and I don't have the guy of

455
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,940
miniature 3d printed on my crappy dream

456
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,880
if quite there questions about

457
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,309
single-player or we're gonna know this

458
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,600
is more like this is more like a

459
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,850
gameplay session not a Q&amp;A session but

460
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,500
we'll try to hit as many questions as

461
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,559
possible Alex as far as solo no we you

462
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,510
know we have a ton of other modes in

463
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,279
this game we've got seven modes I know

464
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,740
that solo is very very important to some

465
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,299
people especially BoardGameGeek they

466
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,669
they love solo it would not be too hard

467
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,549
for you guys to you know create a house

468
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:03,730
rule version of your kind of a solo but

469
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,470
the reason why I didn't work here in my

470
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,510
opinion is because of the Yomi aspect

471
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,340
and reading your opponent and

472
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,840
you know guessing what they're gonna be

473
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,399
doing and stuff like that so I never

474
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,440
intended the game to be played solo it's

475
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Street Fighter it's a celebration of

476
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,580
Street Fighter but that's not to say

477
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,860
that in the future what I'm thinking is

478
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,980
really cool stuff like campaign mode

479
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,409
story mode and when you're thinking like

480
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,600
that you can think of you know final

481
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,059
fine you can think of new like it's kind

482
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,039
of beat em ups and brawlers that's a

483
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,990
whole new game though so if this thing

484
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,999
does well who knows what that'll lead to

485
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,159
or if we do a reprint of this and and

486
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,700
maybe offer new stuff who knows but we

487
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,960
got to make we got to really make this

488
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,960
successful first all right so I guess I

489
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,169
will choose who will I be that is a good

490
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:55,149

509
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,130

two so Joe you won mm-hmm do you want to

512
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,120
have me go first or you go first you go

513
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,650
first I'll go first

514
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,120
go ahead so um looking at my options

515
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:22,730
here right now I'm gonna go here

516
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,429
I like Blanca any Honda quite a bit but

517
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,309
Balrogs super fun to Balrog is really

518
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,290
cool he gets up in your face and when

519
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,770
he's there especially if he gets you in

520
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,150
a corner um I'm gonna attack you Joe

521
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,760
so that was draw we skip the first we

522
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,460
skip drawl the first turn move I moved

523
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,320
one space you can move up to your

524
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,330
movement value Geils movement value is

525
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,540
three and fight which is two actions so

526
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,340
as an action I played in an attack

527
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,830
everything's good I said hey Joe

528
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,330
threw dice which is exactly what I

529
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,340
wanted him to do because I baited him

530
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,250
and they built to meter so we get out

531
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,080
our little health things here we're

532
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,630
using these digital ones for now until

533
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,990
we get in the prototype of little dials

534
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,490
there'll be a dial at the bottom and a

535
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,559
dial at the top the average individual

536
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,929
round takes anywhere from 10 to 20

537
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,340
minutes depending on your experience Joe

538
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,809
and I knockout game is in 10 12 minutes

539
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:20,390
constantly and then you played best

540
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,480
first two - okay so now that I've got

541
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,490
that I got one action left and I'm gonna

542
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:33,380
attack dice perfect all right so that

543
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,840
here comes the real projectile sonic

544
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,720
boom and I've got the zone at the bonus

545
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,870
one two three four it says if you fire

546
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,850
it from four spaces away you get a bonus

547
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,760
so I've got two plus that that's gonna

548
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,080
be three dice and it has EXO I'm gonna

549
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,530
e^x my sonic boom four for total dice so

550
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,100
here we go

551
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,770
and then I will knock back a very badly

552
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,390
which means Joe

553
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,100
we'll get knocked back into the dojo one

554
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,190
two three hits hits did you block

555
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,180
anything no I whipped on everything so

556
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:22,850
take four okay it was cute and okay so

557
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,500
yeah so knock back and you take an extra

558
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,170
damage from that no Lupo and a lot of

559
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,120
people give criticism on dice Joe this

560
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,150
is a the game has a lot of luck

561
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,610
mitigation in it so if you roll poorly

562
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,010
like Joe tends to roll poorly you can

563
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,530
mitigate that with your meter the Xing

564
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,660
it adding dice to it there's also a fans

565
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,000
so don't feel like there's a feel bad

566
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,620
every single time that you roll poor

567
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,080
well there's also illed there's also

568
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,090
guaranteed damage on on terrain too so

569
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,920
if you're you know something that people

570
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,270
said I want guaranteed damage well

571
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,500
that's what charge that's what some of

572
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,520
these other things that happen before

573
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,050
dice or even rolled where you're

574
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,280
knocking people in the walls are into

575
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,960
multiple feast train or into multiple

576
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,300
people and so sometimes if I want to

577
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,190
kill him I just throw okay and him and

578
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,220
they both build meter you're on walk I'm

579
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,560
going to play like dial which if y'all

580
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,690
don't know he kind of stays back throw

581
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,850
sonic booms you get too close you try to

582
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,800
jump at him and kick you

583
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,740
so go ahead that was my turn and Joe's

584
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,440
your turn it's draw since it's Joe's

585
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,140
first turn he skips the draw goes to the

586
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,730
move it looks like he moved two spaces

587
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,770
forward of his three spaces and then

588
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,280
he's got his action phase fight phase

589
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,740
two actions looks like he's gonna use

590
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,930
one action to move so I made him waste

591
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,780
in action and I was only got one action

592
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:47,660
left yeah turtle goes best guy turtle

593
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,250
that is pretty sweet haunted my

594
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,170
childhood friend that was very good at

595
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,530
it

596
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,330
piss me off attacking now you know

597
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,340
they're they're events in the game that

598
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,310
allow you to do cool things this one's

599
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,650
called military intelligence it's a free

600
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,390
action but if it's a free action that

601
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,040
means I have to wait till it's my turn

602
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,020
to do it if it was a response I could do

603
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,270
it on Joe's turn to like interrupt what

604
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,130
he's doing because military intelligence

605
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,300
is pretty sweet so

606
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,730
but okay so Joe's attacking me now what

607
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,480
do I think

608
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,170
a Honda up in my face what kind of

609
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,480
character is a Honda and we will

610
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,190
probably specify these types of

611
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,120
characters like pressure zone er

612
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,740
balanced on their character cars to give

613
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,200
you kind of an idea of how they play and

614
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,870
so if you understand you know Honda's

615
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,430
play style you could say hmm well he's

616
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,630
in my face probably a strike could be a

617
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,450
special more than likely not a

618
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,050
projectile so I'm gonna go and I'm gonna

619
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,100
say what would you'll start with what do

620
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,510
you trust start by throwing me like a

621
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,210
true sumo wrestler would do good course

622
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,970
no I don't think he's that smart so I am

623
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,100
actually going no and you know what

624
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,080
sucks and so hand managing and is a real

625
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,210
important part of the game I have I

626
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,380
don't know if I should be saying this

627
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,540
out loud but I have a nice combo here

628
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,610
right and I don't want to break up my

629
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,320
combo ah

630
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,540
no so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

631
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,940
take my default defense dice and I could

632
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,390
if I wanted boost it with this card here

633
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,610
to go to for defense dice for its

634
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,860
defensive ability all events you can

635
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,120
discard four more dice to block with but

636
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,890
I think Jose is screwing around and I'm

637
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,950
just gonna do my default block of to

638
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,800
throw darn it a very good job very good

639
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,010
all right so what a throw is is if you

640
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,330
don't know the video games it ignores

641
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,090
your block so I got two blocks which is

642
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,740
enough to kind of really mitigate a lot

643
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,920
of damage but go through me like a true

644
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,680
sumo oh you man Joe just whiffed but you

645
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,820
gotta mean the Automator

646
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,310
but he got meaner out of it wide open

647
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,800
that's your water meter alright so we

648
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,470
got that if you let me try it wish I can

649
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,260
get you guys dice and loaded a dice came

650
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,130
out yeah I loaded the bats before

651
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,300
projectiles typically have longer ranges

652
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,980
but there are there are some exceptions

653
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,360
to the game where some projectiles can

654
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,310
be thrown close now whips are a part of

655
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,840
the game because in the video game that

656
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,880
happens a lot and you could do what's

657
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,540
called a punish you know so if a lot of

658
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,890
noobs are button mashers

659
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,270
we'll know how to do the moves but they

660
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,490
won't know the correct frame or range to

661
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,530
execute them this kind of simulates that

662
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,610
because I could throw a card from my

663
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,650
hand if there's certain you know

664
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,240
abilities on it that allow me to punish

665
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,820
him for that and because the game is so

666
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,100
fast these things happen very often or

667
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,830
you know the gameplay goes along and and

668
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,450
you can recover pretty feminin dice are

669
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,190
heavily weighted towards hitting rather

670
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,510
than so that's like your chance of

671
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,960
whipping is actually pretty rare so now

672
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,080
wow rare this job unless your other go

673
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,090
and then you draw so at the beginning

674
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,669
turn you draw you move and you find so a

675
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,549
Honda up in my face don't like it I'm

676
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:09,390
going to go one two three one two tres

677
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,290
kind of you know want to lure him over

678
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,750
here into some terrain now what am i

679
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,000
doing maybe I have a throw in my hand

680
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,309
and I want him to come at me knowing

681
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:22,350
that you know Honda likes to get close

682
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,970
sometimes and then I'll throw him into

683
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,110
one of these pieces of terrain but you

684
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,390
know a Honda has you know some

685
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,059
projectile like attacks like his you

686
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,030
know a torpedo attack and that could be

687
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,340
problematic so I will play my event I'm

688
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,770
gonna play military intelligence look at

689
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,590
any opponents hand choose a card for

690
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,510
them to discard so I'm gonna see if I

691
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,760
can't find that attack that I know that

692
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,250
Honda has and Joe's already smiling at

693
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,140
me let me let me get that on camera

694
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,590
well we want you and your cards we're

695
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,720
gonna look through this and we're gonna

696
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,630
see oh he's got a throw so I'm gonna

697
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,660
take that and you can bow is this other

698
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:13,230
one ooh this one is an event

699
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,350
well I won't spoil it shakin bacon

700
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,530
I took a chose the wrong one yes yeah I

701
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,150
would I would keep watching what we've

702
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,679
got going on cuz there's gonna be some

703
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,900
prizes and that's all we will say yeah

704
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,669
he's gonna he's got something else in

705
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,000
his hand all right so um now two actions

706
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:42,820
um Buffy Babu I will draw a xanax

707
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,010
I'm going to move and we'll continue to

708
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:51,050
annoy the hell out of one you three I'm

709
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,060
now in the corner which may not be the

710
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,560
smartest thing no bear you want to end

711
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,780
here because you are cornering yourself

712
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,610
but I'm confident enough I have some

713
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,040
defensive options if Joe tries you're

714
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:13,040
crazy yeah hmm is there a plan to do

715
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,650
holographic cards foil cards maybe for

716
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,740
promos but nothing yeah because we

717
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,810
wanted to do that initially I want to do

718
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,800
it because I want to do everything

719
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,040
that's cool going to but what I found is

720
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,350
it will kind of warps cards unless your

721
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,850
cards have a lot of strengths and

722
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,380
they're high quality which we just

723
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,480
unlocked your active super high quality

724
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,990
cards so you know it's some we can

725
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,610
consider but I think it's you know

726
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,950
unnecessary but we'll see it may best

727
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,860
promise oh my turn okay so I'm gonna

728
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,220
draw up - so what's your hand limit your

729
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,500
hand limit is seven so I'm gonna go

730
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,810
ahead and get rid of one of these that I

731
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,060
do not need and then I'm going to move

732
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,900
and now I think strategically I'm gonna

733
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,200
go ahead and go in on Joe and I will

734
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,870
play this attack the dice are one

735
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,380
critical one hit one combination hit

736
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,330
block alright it's re - combination

737
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,180
hidden block one block and one meter so

738
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,550
there's the critical there's the hit in

739
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,970
the block there's the block another hit

740
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,150
in a block just a hit on its own and

741
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,830
then finally the meter as well say yeah

742
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,710
well guess let's go with the strike

743
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,830
counter damn good job you got it

744
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,840
okay so you read the bottom of the car

745
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,310
Joe throw place your character in any

746
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,810
space adjacent to the attacker then

747
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,820
throw them up to two spaces and draw

748
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,240
card so just about you so as you could

749
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,190
tell Joe's button-mashing hair if he's

750
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,200
like I'm gonna take a wild guess

751
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,030
I knew thanks a lot all right so what

752
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,780
Debbie 50 all right so that's actually

753
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,090
the first damage you've done to me have

754
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,650
I hurt you yeah your first sonic boom

755
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,750
did it ton okay that's just cuz Joe's

756
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,450
lying to me lighting likes to do okay is

757
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:28,580
that it yeah yeah how dare you I tell

758
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,870
you what you ain't never get miss Joe go

759
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:43,880
ahead attacking don't mess this up

760
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,340
you don't have to counter-attack I

761
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,000
wasn't you don't thank you the part of

762
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,800
the game yeah I was gonna say strike is

763
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,960
influencing yeah it was not a strike I

764
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,160
know betcha what's the word there I

765
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,200
rolled one day reverse spin kick which

766
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,450
is gonna give me three dice it's range 1

767
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,270
to 2 it's got a linker on here so you

768
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,950
think you can guess what I'm about to do

769
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,370
two criticals and Ameche so for damage

770
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,950
three one two three and this was what I

771
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,200
said earlier I had built it I had built

772
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,990
that combo you sit on your combos wait

773
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,450
for the right opportunity or 240 card X

774
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,250
and so legsweep move by one space in any

775
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,440
direction after a successful hit let's

776
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:32,390
see if it's successful flam streams

777
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,520
let me show you what I just wrote I love

778
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,300
unplanned streams bow I blocked one day

779
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,530
so but yeah but half the top before his

780
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,970
guile is got you come on harder what are

781
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,250
you doing up there do the hundred hand

782
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,350
slap is one of my favorite mechanics in

783
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,290
the game that Alex made and I don't know

784
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,230
if Joe is

785
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,850
is a good honda player to know how to

786
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,740
set it up correctly but we'll explain it

787
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,260
to you if he if he ends up using it the

788
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,859
answer to it is your turn

789
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,470
unless I decide to do this my second

790
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,300
military-intelligence let me see your

791
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,990
hair let me see your hand

792
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,900
hey man guile comes to fights prepared

793
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,340
Joe it's Joe has 200 a.m. so there goes

794
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,380
one of them because the more hundred

795
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,450
handed slaps you have the more powerful

796
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,520
that thing is and it is super powerful

797
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,920
so like what I just rolled just scoop in

798
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,020
the bathhouse you guys hockey guard man

799
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,990
if he if he stacks up there 100 is that

800
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:50,119
all right all right it's your turn

801
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,710
I'm sorry guys we don't have the 3d

802
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,990
print so of these I can actually print

803
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,380
them out now on my crappy 3d print well

804
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,819
it's not crappy it's actually pretty

805
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,970
good but it takes them like nine hours

806
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:08,130
to do and I've been at Easton hmm most

807
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,020
cards have anywhere I mean there are

808
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,400
some Singleton's but the pretty rare

809
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,230
most cards have two to three with

810
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,540
someone's going as high as four I can

811
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,730
one won't you care to some five just

812
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,349
like if it's like their iconic move they

813
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,540
may have well I've looked at Joe's hand

814
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,450
and I know that Joe has I think two

815
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,670
throws and how many cards you have in

816
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,760
your hand enough how many he was true to

817
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,460
thanks oh he did draw too so but two

818
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,490
throws is pretty high percentage in into

819
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,480
so I'm gonna counter a strike kind of

820
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,410
strike us this is a baby son of a gun

821
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,740
okay so you counter his attack you'll

822
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,809
draw a card and you gain an expert and

823
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,880
you're gonna interactions turn and so

824
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,410
what that does that's a way to like get

825
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,599
cards out of your opponent's hand so now

826
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,700
if Joe had that throw he would he we've

827
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,740
hit that throw now because he knows I

828
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,630
only had three cards in my hand and I

829
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,819
just wasted my counter throw do I really

830
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,380
have another counter throw in my hand

831
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,270
probably not yeah that's something

832
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,380
that's important about the game is you

833
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,390
may be ahead on life total but if you're

834
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,130
behind on card count like it took is

835
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,690
sill still anyone's game

836
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,450
okay I'm playing a free action I add two

837
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,760
attack dice to my next attack what is it

838
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,799
called no you can't read Japanese

839
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:24,630
yosakoi so Khoikhoi and so for these

840
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,650
types of cards that have those you know

841
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,359
hard to read names we're thinking about

842
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,180
adding like the English name to it or at

843
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,010
the very least the flavor text at the

844
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,630
bottom of the car there you can read out

845
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,880
loud and understand what doing Yoda

846
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,079
literally just says that in the game

847
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,210
yeah yeah I know but I'm just saying out

848
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:53,900
of the future okay

849
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,660
the pressures on I am going to discard

850
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,320
an event for its defensive value here

851
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,490
throw oh okay see if it was a throw he

852
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,930
would have gotten rid of all my

853
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,420
defensive I have that in here so yeah

854
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,360

and a meter so I get three I am now

856
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,110
what's the 2 plus y 2 or meter plus this

857
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,460
one that he discovered because he has

858
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,350
another one yeah for each copy that is

859
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,760
in his discard pile he gets another one

860
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,700
oh my god it's three for the normal

861

to kind of build my like a chicken

895
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:37,110
drawing and there are specific rules for

896
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,550
water the Train acts identically except

897
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,960
for the line-of-sight how that works but

898
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,820
yet water is differently definitely

899
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,920
different I'm gonna drug too you know

900
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,010
it's your turn uh Kyle is like my

901
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,960
childhood nemesis I always play

902
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,880
characters that were horrible against

903
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,100
Kyle so I always like to watch him lose

904
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,410
is there gonna be huh and for me guile

905
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,680
was one of my favorites but I couldn't

906
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,630
play him because he was a charge care

907
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,120
and I'm just no good at so I love charge

908
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,140
characters I just like when I was

909
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,640
playing Blanca Blanca has a horrible

910
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,270
match horrible tacky

911
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,640
okay um how larger these squares you

912
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:26,670
know exactly so here's one of dials

913
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,040
unique thing since Gaia was a turtle

914
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,890
character he has more events that are

915
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,140
defensive oriented so what I'm gonna do

916
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,940
is I'm gonna play this defensive event

917
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,850
it says gang one meter and then it may

918
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,880
be played facedown to counter and II

919
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,710
oops that's the face it's just played oh

920
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,820
it's just played okay right then

921
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,650
encounter any strike within two range is

922
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:52,860
that a strike yeah well you waste wasted

923
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,530
his focus attack to you so it's

924
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,810
I got one meter out of it at least okay

925
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:04,130
well let us now what would have happened

926
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,200
if I guess that right well because if

927
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,090
guy who can guess what your your thing

928
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,120
is this defensive event if countered if

929
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,610
you if it was a strike then you get to

930
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,010
roll a two dice unblockable damage

931
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,930
attack against it so you get don't you

932
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,570
get rewarded for being able to figure

933
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,670
that out

934
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,300
play mother free event ax attack Dooku

935
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,200

boards are large let's see

941
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,310
so Hondas gets a lot of his damage from

942
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,100
his special attacks so do I think Joe's

943

993
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,490
let's go with dice perfect perfect

994
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,250
- oh that's a nice block nice block so -

995
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,309
this is a flash kick which is a charge

996
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:56,770
of - you go back into that rock take one

997
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,520
damage I'm gonna do three and I exit for

998
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,950
one so that's four dice let's see if I

999
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,780
can get a pretty nice roll here and took

1000
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:13,650
your one from the rock yep

1001
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:16,540
yeah I got one critical one two three

1002
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,309
four five well you bunk - yeah yeah good

1003
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:23,319
good block so what are you at now I'm at

1004
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:23,770
8:00

1005
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,890
my turn eight so look I took it from

1006
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,339
seven to eight by predicting what Joe

1007
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:31,720
was going to do he was gonna get

1008
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,280
conservative so I punished him for

1009
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:45,040
blocking Joe's easy to read this know

1010
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,510
facing just now you're going down right

1011
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,400
nope this is the match for who's the

1012
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,770
best job yeah it's just this elbow this

1013
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:59,130
is for the spirit of Joe rocks trees

1014
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,960
missiles what other kinds of

1015
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,480
destructible terrain is there's a time

1016
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,599
yes torches but I mean some of them

1017
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,760
function much the same way there's a lot

1018
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,559
of them function the same way one damage

1019
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:13,510
to damage there's some special ones

1020
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,030
though that can sizzle your meter out

1021
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,559
this is something that's not in the

1022
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:18,460
video game

1023
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,440
there's just the mattock it's into

1024
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,059
creating the cinematic type of secondary

1025
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:25,150
uh-huh two spaces away is Joe mad that I

1026
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,859
focused attacked him is he trying to

1027
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:34,570
focus attack me - away

1028
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,110
well I'm not in danger of being knocked

1029
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,880
into anything I'm thinking projectile or

1030
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,920
special so to count our Bayer bluff you

1031
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,570
have to decide so baits always do one of

1032
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,710
two things they either give your

1033
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,670
opponent meter and give them another

1034
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,320
action so if your opponent's at six and

1035
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,640
you don't want them to get to eight you

1036
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,840
want to do the thing it's it's you're

1037
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,730
choosing the lesser of two evils yeah so

1038
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,990
you have to you have to decide what you

1039
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,900
want to do counter is special it is

1040
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,340
projectile I know that looks like okay

1041
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,440
even or projectile or it's special Mohan

1042
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,320
but a job job good job and I have the

1043
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,670
card that allows me to counter a

1044
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,890
projectile and do a bunch of damage to

1045
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,630
him so damage damage

1046
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,180
one two I'm down to five health knock

1047
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,410
back to knock back at 200

1048
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,200
okay so placing Jana adjacent and then

1049
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,820
and then knock me back all right you got

1050
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,660
one action that job yep there's no limit

1051
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,580
but we purposely designed them so

1052
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,920
someone here to win a 13 hit combo or

1053
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,110
something ridiculous so Plus you can't

1054
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,750
have more than some user here at once

1055
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,890
combos are not out of control they don't

1056
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,990
simulate the game's one-on-one because

1057
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,600
characters in Street Fighter have tons

1058
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,760
of combos and people just discover new

1059
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,430
ones all the time so ours combos are a

1060
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,370
little rarer than normal but that's on

1061
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,260
purpose and balanced in order to keep

1062
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,080
games going quick and not feel

1063
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,910
incredibly unfair yeah alright my turn

1064
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,950
okay so I could still do this

1065
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,530
what's your help eight eight I'm at five

1066
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,380
okay one two three four five six I'm

1067
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,810
good on hand limit chow mein for you I

1068
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,250
mean we've been playing this for quite

1069
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,600
some time and it does come up where

1070
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,220
people are like hmm but this looking at

1071
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,930
your discard pile it's pretty easy to

1072
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,000
kind of figure it back out but there's

1073
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,020
all sorts of ways that you can do it

1074
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,820
with dice with you know the way that

1075
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,300
your character cards facing Wu mission

1076
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,600
start event move in it's a free action

1077
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,550
select up to two event cards from the

1078
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,290
discard pile and place them into your

1079
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,050
hand okay so guess what I'm gonna do I

1080
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,320
am going to grab some military

1081
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,779
intelligence and I'm gonna

1082
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,400
this nice one that I used earlier for

1083
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,400
defense dice I think we had a it's about

1084
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,880
time for you to learn how to fight I

1085
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,959
mean the longest game we've ever had was

1086
00:49:56,959 --> 00:49:58,609
just about an hour and that's was either

1087
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:00,559
five or six person free-for-all and then

1088
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,089
I'm gonna use my military intelligence

1089
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:06,589
to look at your hand and see what joke

1090
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:09,499
encounter he can counter two strikes

1091
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:14,479
they can counter a special but it cannot

1092
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:17,539
counter a projectile and I can discard

1093
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:23,599
one of these cars ooh he's got you tried

1094
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,910
to throw a sumo wrestler stick to your

1095
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,469
other techniques which is whenever I

1096
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:28,759
reveal a throw

1097
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:38,630
Yvonne does like I'm gonna get rid of

1098
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,999
your overhead chop okay and there's a

1099
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,289
lot of combo bonus and some of theirs

1100
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,150
learn specific moves that are kind of

1101
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,559
underpowered on their own but when

1102
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,910
they're combo Din to deal bonus damage

1103
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,619
so setting up combos is very powerful

1104
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,989
and and downtime is of course gonna be a

1105
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:55,099
little longer when you have a six person

1106
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:56,539
game but with that many people you

1107
00:50:56,539 --> 00:50:58,069
probably want to do something like 2 B 2

1108
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:01,099
B 2 or 3 B 3 and you can help your your

1109
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,659
the people on your team set things up

1110
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,489
properly so the downtime is not as bad

1111
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:07,759
as you think I'm gonna move over here

1112
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:11,630
yes you can combo any X and I what you

1113
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,519
do for the for the range is is this rock

1114
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:19,069
blocking this will you take one corner

1115
00:51:19,069 --> 00:51:21,259
one of your corners that your Square and

1116
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:24,739
you draw a line to two and in this case

1117
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:28,219
Oh No so we go a corner here and a

1118
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,469
corner here we're good so you take that

1119
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:32,179
one draw it to this one you take that

1120
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,949
one draw it to this one and you're good

1121
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:38,029
so and plus of rocks which is specified

1122
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:40,699
in the rules are not blocking terrain so

1123
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:42,739
you could fire over the rock if you want

1124
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:44,269
it but I'm just trying to show you guys

1125
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:54,080
how that works attacking

1126
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,920
- locks

1127
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,180
nice sonic boom it's - plus I'll go

1128
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,270
ahead and e^x it for one more dice I was

1129
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,530
trying to get the range bonus it

1130
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,480
couldn't get in the range bonus darn it

1131
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,610
oh nice four hits and it's a naka back

1132
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,220
of two when you are doing a projectile

1133
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,590
knock back the attacker gets to choose

1134
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,750
in which direction and I have several

1135
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,800
options I'm gonna go one two and it's a

1136
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,490
yellow linker guess what sonic boom so

1137
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,200
at this point because it's in the middle

1138
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,180
of a combo what Joe can do is he can

1139
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,950
roll his defense dice or he can boost

1140
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,140
his defense dice by discarding event

1141
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,980
cards so in this case this sonic boom is

1142
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:42,000
- only two dice 1 2 3 4 5 5 spaces away

1143
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,340
I don't get the range bonus so not too

1144
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,260
powerful here would you get two blocks

1145
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:53,550
damn good one yeah three hits got so one

1146
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,530
damage this one has a knock back of one

1147
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,240
boom straight into the oh I'm sorry

1148
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,270
alright so what I did is something boom

1149
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,920
sonic boom into the tree and it says you

1150
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,690
may move guy up to one space in any

1151
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,790
direction on a successful attack for his

1152
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:17,630
quick sonic boom so we'll move him here

1153
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,800
my turning your turn yeah well what's

1154
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:27,960
your help back for oh it's close all

1155
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:38,849
right I'm done four to five guys

1156
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,589
the the health power dial card is

1157
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:49,529
separate from the character stat card

1158
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:58,900
four spaces away hmm that could be oh

1159
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,180
it's not miss jack dial Hondas

1160
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,630
projectile that gets a bonus at four so

1161
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,499
enjoy just laughed so he's not a very

1162
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:14,499
good I'm gonna go sonic break which is a

1163
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:16,390
gain one meter it's one of the gals

1164
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,910
defensive events so imagine a honda

1165
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,619
flying across because i'm pretty sure

1166
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:22,019
that's what it is

1167
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:25,210
like what's a bait you got rid of my

1168
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,079
awesome

1169
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,130
sonic warning you don't get the meter

1170
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,039
don't get demeanor nope baited bummer

1171
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,690
alright so you're gonna make sure that

1172
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,599
draw car I accidentally got the meter

1173
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:41,019
previously again yeah so so in the

1174
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,079
rulebook you're gonna have a timing a

1175
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,579
you know it shows you exactly when

1176
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:47,829
things fire off I get a little too

1177
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:49,900
excited when I'm trying to talk to you

1178
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,119
guys and fight young so you use your

1179
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:58,749
first additional action as a move oh one

1180
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:01,210
more sorry so what I said is in the row

1181
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,859
book there's timing there's a little

1182
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:04,359
timing chart that shows you when you've

1183
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:05,950
make these decisions and how they fire

1184
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:09,009
off I got too excited I think I have one

1185
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:10,779
more meter than I really should have I'm

1186
00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:12,249
at three I think I'll just go down to

1187
00:55:12,249 --> 00:55:14,440
two all right what you doing dragging a

1188
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:21,710
dragon there's AG it was Yank

1189
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,559
I'm gonna get rid of a one that that

1190
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,569
other event that I had in my hand for

1191
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:33,230
its defensive value oh the hundred

1192
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,029
handed slap yeah okay well this is a

1193
00:55:35,029 --> 00:55:37,970
good idea that I did donating my

1194
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,910
defensive event one to only two blocks

1195
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,510
actually this has a value and so far so

1196
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,970
three plus five base yeah and I so three

1197
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:53,599
for getting exit three blocks Joe three

1198
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,329
blocks this could end it

1199
00:55:56,329 --> 00:56:04,160
I get the - one two three four five six

1200
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,789
seven

1201
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:12,140
oh no not bit o six that's one four five

1202
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,630
six eat when you react something you

1203
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,819
ignore the yeah you care they're not

1204
00:56:16,819 --> 00:56:19,329
able to build meter when you spend meter

1205
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:21,890
however when you executing supers and

1206
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,260
ultras these meters turn into extra

1207
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,680
damage so in this case Joe did six I

1208
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,770
block three of them so I go down three

1209
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,430
I'm at five I have two health left I

1210
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,010
survived

1211
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,490
alright your help that job for dojo

1212
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,559

1213
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,869

1216
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,289

1217
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:13,970
nice one block seven dice coming your

1218
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,279
way he is built up so many hundred

1219
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:19,309
handed slabs don't whiff come on we have

1220
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:22,250
more and more powerful what do you mean

1221
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,200
with me use your all of them yeah you

1222
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,550
had to draw all of them but I will

1223
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:36,710
laughs Joe if you oh you're dead you

1224
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:47,670
hiney but look how close that was

1225
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,210
I'm scared don't beat the hell out of me

1226
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,550
right and then I was like all right i'ma

1227
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,690
try hard this and I came within one no -

1228
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,910
what's your help before what's like one

1229
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,390
game within four you know so I did make

1230
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,740
some mistakes so I was a little

1231
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,080
overconfident with kind of you know how

1232
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,630
Joe plays sort of took a lot of damage

1233
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,550
to the face the hundred handed slaps

1234
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,700
guys it's so satisfying it is because

1235
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,080
they're weak they're weak at first but

1236
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,370
then they get so much better at then

1237
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,620
yeah they're super weak at first but

1238
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,120
yeah the more you play the better they

1239
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,670
get and so when that becomes a danger

1240
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,360
when when it's late game Honda gets

1241
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,440
dangerous and so you want to start

1242
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,780
countering specials because the hundred

1243
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,370
handed slap is a specialist right but

1244
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:34,170
you notice right you strong was that you

1245
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,000
want to counter special see he's gonna

1246
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,500
use that to his advantage

1247
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,070
all right anyways so the game I'm

1248
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,780
telling you guys I mean I've been

1249
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,030
playing this game for like two years in

1250
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,040
all these different versions and this is

1251
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,510
the best version we throw a lot of fun

1252
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:50,190
it's still a lot of fun we never get

1253
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,290
sick of it you've set things up real

1254
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,310
quick for another one

1255
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,140
obviously this match is probably about

1256
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,150
twice as long as it normally is because

1257
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,410
we're talking we're you know

1258
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,410
demonstrating things for you guys and

1259
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,990
yeah so I think we'll do one more match

1260
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:08,190
Joe you for the day did I specify that

1261
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:11,040
it's best Joe for the day not for all

1262
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,780
time say yeah that's a yeah

1263
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,720
all right so other Joe is the superior

1264
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,100
Joe for today so I guess we would plan

1265
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,750
to have four people here sorry last

1266
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,520
minute guy got sick it wasn't able to

1267
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,040
show up to do a team game for you

1268
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,840
so we'll do we could do a free-for-all

1269
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,480
just to show you kind of the

1270
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,210
how fun free-for-alls are and then on

1271
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:35,510
the future stream i think this it's next

1272
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,880
week we plan to show you some of the new

1273
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,220
modes i want to have a little bit of

1274
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,810
extra time just to polish it make sure

1275
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,970
everybody understands the rules new

1276
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,330
modes that use these powerup tokens that

1277
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:51,140
i print it right so you get these

1278
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,140
powerup tokens a new rule set and what

1279
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,240
the powerup tokens do is you like you

1280
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,750
know in the match to put these tokens

1281
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:03,350
out throughout the map and it encourages

1282
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:08,150
you know even more movement as people go

1283
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,000
and try to deny tokens from each other

1284
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,520
and grab the tokens you grab a token you

1285
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,040
reveal and you've got what is this this

1286
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,050
is plus two health so you can

1287
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,450
immediately get that now or you can

1288
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,060
bring it over here and just kind of save

1289
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,369
it for later if you want so that you

1290
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:27,290
know if you already have health kind of

1291
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,510
how powerup mode works there's a little

1292
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,609
bit more to it and in the rulebook and

1293
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:34,130
then one of the other ones that we've

1294
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,760
recently unlocked is the tag-team mode

1295
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,930
tag-team mode is super fun because you

1296
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,660
get a we haven't quite worked it out

1297
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,090
100% as these at three or two we have

1298
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,609
work to network but we've been through

1299
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:52,070
multiple let me get the we've been

1300
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,840
through multiple versions of these to

1301
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,540
see which one is the best so they all

1302
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,920
run into it but we got it all written

1303
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,550
down and what's cool is that you know in

1304
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,470
tag-team when we are say fighting

1305
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,560
somebody you can be Vega and you're

1306
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:11,060
fighting chun-li and your let's say your

1307
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:15,650
partner is a god it's like Sagat chun-li

1308
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,280
and can right so you can be in the

1309
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,859
middle of a combo boom boom doing damage

1310
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:25,400
putting cards down boom boom you know

1311
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,770
and then in the middle of the combo you

1312
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,109
can spend one of your tag-team tokens to

1313
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:31,730
swap out because your friends like dude

1314
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,980
I got a combo too you know so you swap

1315
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,170
them out in mid combo and then they

1316
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,970
continue their combo and then they go

1317
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,890
boom boom boom you know so it's pretty

1318
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,810
cool however when you're doing that

1319
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,170
you're spending attack

1320
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,359
teen token which you could use otherwise

1321
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,329
in order to you know sort of recover a

1322
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,250
little bit of your health so it's a

1323
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,809
strategic decision you only have a

1324
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,220
certain amount of them yeah

1325
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,589
and so it's it's do you want to use it

1326
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:57,510
aggressively or do you want to save it

1327
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,760
to use it a little bit more defensively

1328
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,220
and let your people recover it is super

1329
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,980
fun and the system is flexible enough

1330
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,200
that it allows for all this stuff to

1331
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,150
happen like I'm so excited guys because

1332
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,849
I love this this game in theory a tag

1333
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:14,130
team could get a combo of 21 cards but

1334
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,799
it's also it if one player is getting

1335
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,510
beat up real bad they could just swap

1336
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,710
out with another one of their teammates

1337
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,150
and they can split up the damage so yes

1338
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,470
you're using all of your cards but then

1339
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,880
they're like well we can also tag team

1340
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,829
out and have all the damage goes in the

1341
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,030
middle of your combo though they're

1342
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,530
doing tons of damage do they spend one

1343
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,480
of their tokens and they mitigate the

1344
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,950
damage that goes to their their buddy

1345
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,589
who may have more defensive event cards

1346
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:36,720
in his hand he spends those defensive

1347
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,329
event cards you're gonna love the guys

1348
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:41,040
so please back the game if you haven't

1349
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,480
backed already if you're watching it's

1350
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,799
totally worth it it gets even better

1351
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:46,049
every day thank you guys so much and

1352
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:49,559
let's do a little three player match I

1353
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:52,319
mean so my title is defended in

1354
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:53,849
one-on-one matches because in

1355
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:57,240
free-for-all it's it's mostly 2v1

1356
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,650
I mean there's some things that mitigate

1357
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,339
some of that like the well you'll see

1358
01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:04,410
the only reason is Alex wins a lot in

1359
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,359
one-on-one so that's why I mean Joel

1360
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,670
kind of gang up on Alex a little bit in

1361
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,680
free-for-all for those power gamers that

1362
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,910
just goes to show you the more you know

1363
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,859
about the game the higher your win rate

1364
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:15,329
so people are like oh it's just dice

1365
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:17,190
dice rolling has nothing to do with it

1366
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,900
it's like I know if that's not true

1367
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,599
come show up yeah and the dice world

1368
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,130
does have to do it sometimes there's

1369
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,420
look in the game oh of course

1370
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,700
but there's looking in Street Fighter

1371
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,490
games as well and we wanted to keep it

1372
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,140
exciting so did I so I put the skill

1373
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:35,910
love factor at like 6040 maybe 6535 I'm

1374
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,290
not very good at method you know Vega

1375
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,869
has some long range dashes and he has

1376
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:42,420
some very thematic things that if you

1377
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,829
were a fan of Vega you will like him

1378
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:50,019
and you will be Hana so we'll just have

1379
01:03:50,019 --> 01:04:00,880
a stand-in for Zangief all right okay so

1380
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:08,400
we roll three one two three

1381
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,380
wow that's a lot go don't really get in

1382
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,539
the game Joe did announce that it's

1383
01:04:16,539 --> 01:04:18,759
coming soon there will be dice add-on

1384
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:20,739
yeah right now vote to see if you want

1385
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:23,049
it to be sharp edges or round corners or

1386
01:04:23,049 --> 01:04:24,189
a square corners and of course whatever

1387
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:26,650
they do a dice add-on for you guys so

1388
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,239
you're gonna have as many dice as we do

1389
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,410
because we don't like to touch each

1390
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,779
other's dice yeah very you know and it's

1391

01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,630
all right so then we go clockwise I will

1397
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:53,410
go last and you will go second sir all

1398

I'll go ahead and since I'm third I'm

1400
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,670
gonna put it yeah I'm sorry you're first

1401
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,849
you put your guy on the mat first I

1402
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:06,189
gotta look this up in the rules a little

1403
01:05:06,189 --> 01:05:09,699
scatterbrained today I'll go here so as

1404
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,349
long as you're at least three spaces

1405
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:14,109
away out on the enemy yeah I am guile

1406
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:18,660
yeah the stand-in is forgot since the go

1407
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,789
what I see Howie I just like the view of

1408
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:23,799
that angle it's roll it like that tree

1409
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:27,029
is really nice sure okay everybody

1410
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:32,109
shuffled right and draw your cards you

1411
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:34,660
can mulligan if you don't like your hand

1412
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,630
1 2 3 4 5 which Mulligan becomes a

1413
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:38,979
little more important for somebody like

1414
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:41,199
guile because he's got a lot of events

1415
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:43,540
you don't want to money a day

1416
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,760
at the initial and this is a perfect

1417
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,060
perfect perfect opening okay

1422
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,940
away from you get two sets so you have

1423
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,340
two of the main characters yes shadow

1424
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,460
everybody by two through mirror matches

1425
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,690
also people who like painting miniatures

1426
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,310
like I do you want to paint them

1427
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,560
alternate color schemes you can paint Oh

1428
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,420
tell you new Alex are you attacking me

1429
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,240
you close this one and chun-li is like

1430
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,920
one of the fastest her movement is four

1431
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,880
yeah she's one of the fastest in the

1432
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,610
game um let's see I'm just gonna use

1433
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,290
block guys cuz I don't trust you okay

1434
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,670
what you got head stop I knew it and I

1435
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,250
get one plus one to my range

1436
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,510
nice one block low meter yeah there are

1437
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,940
other stage boards two four six you can

1438
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,680
see them on the Kickstarter pretty good

1439
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,990
it's pretty there's more coming up in

1440
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:56,080
the stretch goals if we get there I

1441
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,570
thought you and I'm done maybe we can

1442
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:02,080
consider offering badass stages as an

1443
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,990
add-on if you guys wanted enough cuz we

1444
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:08,020
have worked on a lot of stages would you

1445
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,750
say your turn my turn yeah no no my turn

1446
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,980
oh uh attack you

1447
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,670
what why wait what is this did you

1448
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,370
figure oh yeah yeah yeah I'll use this

1449
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:20,770
one it is thank you

1450
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,700
your Zord and trust guys it is a throw

1451
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,040
you don't get nice it'll hit your table

1452
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,320
all the time and it's so easy to set up

1453
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,200
so easy to play uh one two three plus

1454
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,060
I'm gonna throw you into a tree so take

1455
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,270
four I get another meter and and it's I

1456
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,320
liken it to like a party game you know

1457
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,810
and then I will also keep my I will also

1458
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,980
draw two and then I'm done

1459
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,570
I gotta you dad here you're the one who

1460
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,730
attacked the sumo in the back and then I

1461
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,590
threw you into a tree yes in the waters

1462
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,940
the water's fine

1463
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,480
draw draw help you Joe

1464
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,550
okay what do you like we're making a

1465
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,880
honda sandwich yes a lot of meat at

1466
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:11,300
zagging um let's see I think that is a

1467
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,840
strike no it is a special reverse spin

1468
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,180
kick for three dice so you're gonna eat

1469
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:21,050
it eat it and that is too damaged in a

1470
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,600
meter and oh we can't forget that this

1471
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,250
is a free-for-all so that's how you use

1472
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:30,650
this token here this token is the shield

1473
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,530
or guard I think is what I call it and

1474
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:36,260
the more people that focus on him the

1475
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,990
more defense dice he'll get so he starts

1476
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,510
off with two defense dice if I attack

1477
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:43,340
him he'll get three if Joe's attacking

1478
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,930
gets four if there's a bunch of other

1479
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,780
players because you can go up this

1480
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,950
because you can go up to six player

1481
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,960
free-for-all and if more and more people

1482
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,880
attack it and then it becomes not worth

1483
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,830
it you're like ionic and actually you're

1484
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,350
pissing him off because if he's rolling

1485
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,540
all of these blocking by leaders it's

1486
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,370
more than likely his meter is gonna

1487
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,380
build and he's gonna make you pay for it

1488
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:07,010
so it's super fun I say that a lot but

1489
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:11,600
it is okay three on three your hands

1490
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,310
don't work together all but in tag-team

1491
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,320
mode you can combo based on your

1492
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,780
teammates combo if you tag team in and

1493
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,970
use one did you did did you take my

1494
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:22,730
damage I did okay so I was done there

1495
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:26,300
and I'm gonna combo and you've got the I

1496
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,650
dunno katana

1497
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,270
yeah but it's still the same action it's

1498
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,770
still the same action so it doesn't get

1499
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:35,030
put into effect yet oh no damage but I

1500
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:37,010
built two meter and that's another thing

1501
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,070
is I hate feel bad and what's cool is

1502
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:41,990
that not only is this thematic to the

1503
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:43,850
video game but it's also appropriate

1504
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,920
because even when you execute some of

1505
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,770
your super Earths or special moves and

1506
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,660
different your meter will fill even if

1507
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,820
you're not doing some damage in a lot of

1508
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,530
different fighting games so I built

1509
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:56,860
meter I'm doing good on meter go ahead

1510
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,190
go your way no no no that was just one

1511
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:05,070
what I am I will draw two cards go ahead

1512
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:08,100
I'm gonna prepare for the worst and I

1513
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,610
got the event Charlie's dog tags

1514
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:13,650
the longer they know the only there's

1515
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,300
only some characters that get more

1516
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,770
powerful as the game goes on and that's

1517
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,510
based on certain moves that get more

1518
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,920
powerful based on how many things are in

1519
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,790
the discard pile

1520
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,230
typically characters are pretty

1521
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,280
consistent with their damage throughout

1522
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:28,260
the game I mean you over the course the

1523
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,520
game I guess you're sculpting your hands

1524
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,780
you could be more powerful because

1525
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,100
you're drawing more cards and you're

1526
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,120
like alright I'm setting up this really

1527
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,960
sweet combo are you going away from you

1528
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:45,330

1529
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:48,810

1533
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,780

1534
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,730
your chun-li maybe chun-li can strike

1535
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:13,050
from that distance let's just let's just

1536
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:16,230
play it safe and go to blocking one

1537
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,050
block in one meter it is a projectile

1538
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:22,170
there's Koken I'm glad I went safe cuz I

1539
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:26,150
didn't think it would be every desktop

1540
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:29,700
four hits minus one one two three

1541
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,290
knocked back into a wall you and it is

1542
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:39,510

1550
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,550

1551
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:11,310
results hey man I was distracted I was

1552

01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:21,900
constantly leaning on I hate y'all I got

1555
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:27,600
one box one two three I'm down to 18 no

1556
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,489
but seriously I was deep the thought

1557
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:32,640
about the game play testing never

1558
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,739
spending bird kick the whole major thing

1559
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:38,550
we took that out of what I was okay

1560
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:43,080
those are combos so mine eggs yeah you

1561
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,420
get this token now oh you get that I got

1562
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,900
beat on token and this token I want to

1563
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,550
try to make it like that like a shield

1564
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,410
so that everybody can kind of see maybe

1565
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,770
do I don't know 3 3 D counters or

1566
01:12:55,770 --> 01:13:00,090

01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:17,190
named Darren constant plating that is

1570
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:20,730
I'm gonna I copyright that even though

1571
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,480
was your joke

1572
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:32,280
I'm constant plating uh attacks on me I

1573
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,060
think the most in the game is eight

1574
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,550
eight eight at act ice yeah so I mean

1575
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,810
attack you get that you get as many as

1576
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:40,950
you need something like you're having

1577
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,950

any stage you're black he's vulnerable

1661
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,410
Joe you shouldn't have done that regards

1662
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,870
you got oh like I said how many card you

1663
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:05,570
have to take you gal huh five five

1664
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:07,060
that's too many

1665
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:18,860
uh that's actually no I don't have

1666
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,399
fireballs

1667
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:23,559
yeah but it's Honda he's gonna fly

1668
01:18:23,559 --> 01:18:30,729
across the map he has five cards Joe

1669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,530
come on it could be a bait - this is

1670
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,269
going up on the Kickstarter hey can't

1671
01:18:34,269 --> 01:18:37,840
wait all day I see it's got makes every

1672
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,729
roll we roll one of the Reba level

1673
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:42,070
mix-up is a keyword one allows you to

1674
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:44,139
force your opponent to re-roll some of

1675
01:18:44,139 --> 01:18:48,429
his defensive dice it was I I wish but

1676
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:50,199
because this is sumo smash where he

1677
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:51,820
jumps up in the air and he slams his

1678
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,260
butt down and you play see honda into

1679
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,669
any adjacent space opponent after

1680
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:59,800
playing is that the way I want to go I

1681
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:08,429
think that's probably where I want to go

1682
01:19:08,429 --> 01:19:18,010
yeah and then let's um go dile dile dile

1683
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:22,989
dile counter a strike cuz you're trying

1684
01:19:22,989 --> 01:19:23,739
to throw me

1685
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:27,249
I am yep whoa place your character in

1686
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:30,369
any space adjacent to the attacker soup

1687
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:32,320
and then guess what I'm gonna do I'm

1688
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,780
throwing nine into Joe so you and Joe

1689
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,729
take one damage we should make that due

1690
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:40,840
to damage because Honda's huge no gain

1691
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,329
that was my turn boy and you done pissed

1692

going to with a black core and they're

1784
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:32,280

1785
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,080
Gathering cards because we have a ub

1786

wrestler to become the world's strongest

1824

when defending against attack within

1825

2041
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,680
was at five health because that that was

2042
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,110
gonna and I have a really good defensive

2043
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:41,730
car but I chose not to use it because I

2044
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:44,070
was like he's not you don't have you

2045

01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:48,930

at 1111 1 and now this goes away tough

2049
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:08,040
yeah that did that goes away

2050
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,130
there are some events that do that the

2051
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:12,780
only stun the stun keyword in this game

2052
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,570
if the move connects it forces them to

2053
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:23,480
discard a card at random

2054
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:33,480
what's your meter shoots concentrate

2055
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,120
that form so if I guess right twice he

2056
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:36,630
