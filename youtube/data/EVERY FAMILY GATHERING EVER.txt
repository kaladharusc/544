1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,000
Well dinner's ready, pull up a seat :) Um, mom, I don't think we're going to be able to fit at that table..

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Nonsense! There's more than enough room. We're gonna sit down, and eat like a family. Right.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,260
Come together. Make room! Mom, there is no room. You know what, we're gonna eat like a family!

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,760
Eat like a family!

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,540
Ow, this hurts!

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,540
FAMILY!

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,860
I can't feel my arm..

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,940
FAMILY!!!

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,320
Oh, it's perfect. Okay, eat up!

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,360
Aww, this turkey looks amazing mom!

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,160
*bites*

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,500
AHHHHHH! M-my frickin' leg!

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Every family gathering ever!

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,320
All right, everyone! I think, we can all agree to not talk about politics tonight!

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay? I'm sick of every family dinner just getting into this heated debate. So, Sam would you mind passing the water please?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,980
Would you like me to pass it to the right or to the left? I'm assuming to the left 'cause

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,820
You're cool with this kind of handouts

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,760
Oh, don't even start Sarah! You were on unemployment for like the last year!

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,260
Ok, calm down Greg, you frickin' snowflake!

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,160
PASS THE DAMN WATER! The ice is melting!..

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,680
Oh, and I'm assuming you're just gonna blame that on climate change!

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,900
Come on!!

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,500
*tons of blabber*

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,760
Who's touching my foot under the table?!

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,900
So like, he'll just hit me up all the time and it's just so obvious how thirsty he is.

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,560
So like, I need to tell him that he's more fam than bae.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,920
Okay, sorry, uh, Sarah, honey, yeah, can I get a translation?

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,380
Oh, of course!

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,580
Go ahead.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,720
So they'll just hit me up all the time. Not physically hit just text.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,180
Just so obvious how thirsty he is.

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,480
No dehydration, just horny.

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,980
So, like, I don't wanna tell him he's more fam than bae.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,340
Brother, not boyfriend.

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,280
Also, I am so weak for Justin.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,500
Attracted to.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I feel like I should wait about a week before sliding in.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,660
Messaging him.

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,040
Because if Bryan found out, he would just think I was savage af.

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,800
Mean.

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,700
Oh, which is so frustrating, because, that means I have to wait about a month before we could hook up.

42
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,320
Nothing to do with fishing.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,220
Oh..

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,920
Mom, just this-

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,180
No, I understand. We called it swirling the milkshake, back in my day.

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,240
Psst! When do you think grandma's gonna die?

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,380
So we thought the reason why he locked himself in his bedroom the whole weekend, was because he was nervous about his backne (acne on your back).

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,960
But, it turns out he just didn't know what to do with his crusty bedsheets!

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,740
I tell you one, that puberty really is something.

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,780
God, stop!

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,620
It's like you guys calculate exactly what to say to embarrass me.

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,580
Whaaaaat?

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,560
(mockingly) Nooooo.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,740
Ok, So after I bring up the fact that he might have a little girlfriend,

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,760
You bring up that you found him not ironically watching the American Girl Doll show.

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
Oh, that's great! So when he chimes in to tell us to shut up,

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,060
You tell him that he has food stuck in his teeth!

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,400
I love that!

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,080
And.. Break!

60
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,440
The best part of Thanksgiving is when it's over.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,920
It's crazy how mom manages to turn everything she makes bone dry.

62
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,620
Tell me about it.

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,820
*coughs*

64
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,100
Damn you Tryptophan! *snores*

65
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:35,120
*music*

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
Sarah, phones down.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,540
Sorry!

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,640
*music continues*

69
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:52,260
Steven, Jen, Greg, phones down!

70
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,060
Phillip,

71
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,180
Phillip, oh!

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,780
Dude, what the hell?

73
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you doing?!

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,480
I'm just laughing at my d#ck!

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,820
It is pretty funny!

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,480
*both chuckle*

77
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,000
Jesus, Marie, get off the phone!

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,040
And that's why I can't have cats in my apartment.

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,580
*oh's*

80
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,660
You know that reminds me of this one time in 1986..

81
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,640
*thinking* Great this story again,

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,480
*also thinking* He literally tells this every year!

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,500
*also thinking* He has to know he's told this before, right? I mean, doesn't he have any other stories?

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,300
*ALSO thinking* Yeah, it's like this is the only thing ever on his mind.

85
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,340
*also thinking* Like, think of something else, we've heard this already!

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,340
*last person thinking* Yeah, you old stupid turd!

87
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,480
Anyway I ended up in-

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,400
Please, just let me have this.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,420
It's the only memory that brings me any semblance of joy!

90
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,320
And that is how I caused the infamous space shuttle disaster.

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,060
*awkward laughs*

92
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,340
Good times.

93
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,340
