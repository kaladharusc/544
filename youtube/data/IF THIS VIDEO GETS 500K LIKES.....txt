1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,100
If this video gets 5,000 retweets.
My mom is going to buy me an Xbox .

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,120
Please guys.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,660
Can we smash 5,000 likes on this video?

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,380
And CEO of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki,
has agreed to take me to prom!

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,860
Pleaseeee guys if this video gets...

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,960
(Earrape)
10,000,000,000

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,640
Elon Musk will send me to space and leave me there.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,100
That's right haters, no more YouTube videos

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,440
Begging for likes, it's something that we all do.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,220
#Relatable.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,120
Leave a like if you agree on that one.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,380
But when does begging for likes 
just become too much, too annoying?

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,640
Sometimes, I like to sneak a little

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,160
&quot;Hey guys, did you enjoy this video?
Be sure a leave a LiKe!&quot;

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,620
But some people just take it too far. Some people
have no integrity and they just start yelling.

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,820
1oNEjidshsakhghafghdsagfmillonlikes?

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,460
They start screaming

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,480
(Bass boost)
ArRRGHHGHGGH

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,680
And they are ANG-

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
It makes me ANGRIY.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,980
What are you?

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,480
(Text-to-speech)
ｇａｙ?

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,840
(Sive puts Senfield music)

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,400
Now with the latest trend of things... I'm just gonna keep em' up here (huehue)

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,360
of begging for likes has gone- it's gone too far

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,800
You've gone two steps too far. It makes me so mad

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,640
I could snap my back into half right now.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,740
The new trend of begging for likes has become

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,579
Can I get better grades please for retweets you may have seen this tweet it got hundred and thirty seven thousand retweets

30
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,880
Hundred thousand retweets and mr.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,189
Fryer will bub my 89.2% to a ninety percent from last semester

32
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:48,020
Probably won't happen, but we'll try

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,229
We will try to get me a better grade apparently a lot of people obviously bought into this

34
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,700
I mean it got 137 thousand retweets

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:03,250
No, I'm not salty that this got more retweets than my engagement. That's not it at all. Okay. This is the dumbest shit

36
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,110
I've ever seen I don't know how the American school system works. I don't know how grades work

37
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,269
They're basically what we had at least in university was three is past and five is maximum

38
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,250
So you either get nothing three four or five?

39
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:22,209
And then you get a beverage from that if it works somewhat similar that she needs a 4.0. I'm sorry, but you suck

40
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:28,130
Why are so many people retweeting this and why did this teacher I?

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,110
Remember there was just no way in my school that you could even sweet talk anything about

42
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,110
Changing the grade if you thought the teacher could made a mistake you could bring that up and be like hey

43
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,670
Sorry you corrected this

44
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,380
But I think the injection should be like this it happened and the teacher would change it but doing it for retweets

45
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,310
I'm sorry, but what the hell that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen I worked so damn hard okay

46
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,200
So no one else should get anything for free

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,380
People shouldn't get things for free now apparently this is not the only time this has been a thing we need

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:06,400
24,000 retweet by June 1st, this is posted just a few weeks before we need

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,060
24,000 retweet by June for no accounting final help us

50
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,880
why

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,380
Why

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,329
Just take the test like everyone else why did the teacher agree to this

53
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,850
Yeah, you know what that's a lot of retweet

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,370
I

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,730
Suppose there will be no final who cares what you learn or not if you can get a lot of retweets on

56
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,980
The internet that is the most that is the most valuable source of all time

57
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,310
Anything else has no real importance or value

58
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,569
Learning things is not important as retweets how about that lesson to you kids so a lot of people started to

59
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:54,020
Try and recreate this if we can get five thousand retweets my accounting class has no final

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,020
twitter do your thing go Twitter go!

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,660
If we work together we can do anything!

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,170
No school!

63
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,099
Yay, oh, you got 248 that's too bad

64
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,510
attention Twitter

65
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:12,300
Misses Kiska calculus teacher had offers to give us three student in the picture a passing grade

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:21,280
If this gets 25 thousand retweets, please help us with this. Oh, No it only got 78 retweets. Oh no

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,630
They're not gonna pass their grade.

68
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,789
My heart bleeds for these students wearing wearing a vest and a tie

69
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,570
I can't even tell who is the student and who's the teacher these people are struggling in school

70
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,599
I've got 10 days left come on guys oh

71
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,840
He tweeted @Ninja

72

Ninja please I'm gonna--. Ninja, please. I need your help, man

73
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,360
Ninja why? Did you not retweet these what the Frick dude? You could have used your fortnite influence

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,949
so selfish some people oh, man

75
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,030
I would have easily retweeted this

76
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,000
Because this is just for a good cause okay everyone hate school hashtag

77

I hate school too leave a like on this video guys. Can we hit?

78
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,880
50,000 likes in school will just disappear

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,039
That's right my principal agreed upon it and if we get 1 million likes

80
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,689
My teacher will perform seppuku and the whole school system

81
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:26,520
And the universe will disappear the earliest example I can find of this was in in December last year. They asked for

82
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:35,080
75,000 retweets to not get their final exam in international marketing at least if the subject is marketing and you managed to get

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,840
50,000 retweets I said I can sort of understand that but just skipping your accounting exam is just like why

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
500,000 retweets and mr

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,659

87
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,270
Retweet so funny. Can you at least clean up your whiteboard?

88
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,340
Every single time it's all American students - is it that bad

89
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,660

Pathetic all right a thousand retweets. Do you know what that is to me nothing it means nothing to me?

92
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,780

93

137
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:31,360
I know what you're up to. We need to shame these people Rita Ora shame on you by the way make Twitter get hacked

138
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,149
Somebody's threatening to release new music. I've worked really hard on that no one wants to hear

139
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:41,139
Listen it was funny. Once I get it the whole

140
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,389
Retweet to get Carter his nuggets. It was funny. It was memable

141
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:52,509
It was weird okay, and the fact that this tweet has more retweets than Barack Obama tweet

142
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,779
There's something beautiful about that, but these cringy ass kids

143
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:01,229

I will enter this closet, and I will never come back. That's right

All we need.

147
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
5000 is too little? 500k likes

148
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,140
and I'll never come back.

154
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,000
