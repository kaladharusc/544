14

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,769
well we've taken a minor deviation from

19
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,449
the plan today and ended up at a

20
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,030
shooting range I haven't shot a gun

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,829
since Boy Scouts but today's the day

22
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,290

oh that's what I'm always saying that do

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,299
things that scare you and this is pretty

26
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,860
scary

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,380
yes safety is probably on make sure to

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:31,400

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,060

I mean point-blank range that's not bad

39
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,879
that's not bad for first time boy Danny

40
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,709
is apparently a natural at this

41
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,989
just popping bullets in there like she's

42
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,819

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,800
in brave show it's a little more

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:41,030
distance oh now now on with the

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,680
sunglasses no I just realized that

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,150
they're flying back oh that's true yeah

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:04:13,860
gotta protect those eyes as I feel

58
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,090
all right I mean first up this is that's

59
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,000
a pretty good spread okay you need to

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
practice you need to practice more

61
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,900
shooting Wii games and stuff I think to

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,130
get their bravery were looking orders

63
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,310
practice here I'd I think I did I think

64
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,740
I did a little better a little better

65
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,400
okay

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
alright let's get some real disses going

67
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,420
then it's a real competition alright

68
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,260
let's do this

69
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,210
I have fired the 9-millimeter Danny is

70
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,530
fired at once already but I wanted to

71
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,420
show you Danny fired me because it's

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,170
adorable

73
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,630
cuz it has so much kick back it's

74
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,730
probably adorable when I did it to a gun

75
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,680
it has a kick back though don't it oh

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,690
yeah also our gun was malfunctioning by

77
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,000
the way so we are here to shooting range

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,620
and we're borrowing bullets and we're

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,080
borrowing guns and that gun wasn't

80
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,460
working thankfully the guys here know

81
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,470
what they're doing so they do recommend

82
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,970
this place they're very careful

83
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,850
who

84
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,170
what a weird thing to do on a Friday

85
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,160
night nine-millimeter hi machines guys

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,279
here we go

87
00:05:17,279 --> 00:06:10,099
let's see goodbye target we did it

88
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,089
so now your first time at a shooting

89
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,469
range where do you think oh my god I

90
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,659
want to shoot more I will say what's

91
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,219
cool about this is I would have never

92
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,229
done that I think my friends have asked

93
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,459
me to do it Danny's asked me to do it

94
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,929
several times I find it's how to do it

95
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,449
tonight this is facing one of my fears I

96
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:25,799
have always been really uncomfortable

97
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,409
around guns but you know we now have one

98
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:29,879
in the house I need a little bit of gun

99
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,829
training a little bit of practice now I

100
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,839
have it but that was a blast

101
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,459
so much thank you for getting me out of

102
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,539
my box and getting me to do weird stuff

103
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,399
thank you for doing it any much we're

104
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,319
done at Oh well it's been a couple of

105
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,299
days since we filmed that and I'm going

106
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:43,649
to upload it to the channel here even

107
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,849
though I think YouTube is going to bury

108
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,159
this video because they generally don't

109
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,989
like it when people talk about weapons

110
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,039
at all they don't really like anything

111
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,139
political anymore so I'm curious to see

112
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,399
whether or not you'll see this video if

113
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,439
you did please like it share it leave a

114
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,849
comment I don't want to get political

115
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,379
here because I don't really think about

116
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,089
the politics of weapons along that lines

117
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,259
but what I do want to say with this

118
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,269
video is it was always one of my

119
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,159
greatest fears to hold a weapon in my

120
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,459
hand to use a weapon recreationally or

121
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,589
to protect my own life but I know with

122
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:11,759
the state of the world with state of

123
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,229
YouTube I feel like it's probably not a

124
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,209
bad idea to have a weapon in the house

125
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,949
and we do have one now so I really

126
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,899
wanted an opportunity practicing using

127
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,610
one knowing that if I ever needed to I

128
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,949
would be able to protect myself and my

129
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,319
family but I had been mortally afraid of

130
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,149
weapons ever since I was very very young

131
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,759
I shot guns and Boy Scouts I got knocked

132
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,180
down by the kickback of a shot

133
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,310
I didn't even like picking up a 22 I

134
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,660
didn't like my grandfather's collections

135
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,460
I didn't like my dad's collections I

136
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,229
didn't want to do anything with him I

137
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,880
was mortally afraid and so going to the

138
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,979
shooting range was facing one of my

139
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,840
biggest fears and sometimes when you

140
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,870
face your biggest fears you triumph and

141
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,979
now I'm actually kind of itching to go

142
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,720
back I am actually looking forward to

143
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,560
going back and shooting at the

144
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,350
recruiting reg it was kind of cool

145
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,419
that's head I also have to go back as I

146
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,419
left my ID there guys as always thanks

147
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,880
for watching I love you very much and

148
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll speak with you again soon
