4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,310

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,130

11
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,739
you're right Chuck

12
00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:03,059
this has to be done bobsie

13
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,240
wubbzy was a bobcat tune i guess the

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,220
video game company accolade tried to

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,869
push as their mascot of sorts

16
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,430
you know someone to rival the likes of

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,470
Mario and Sonic he did a good job here

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,770
guys it's a cat and put a bitch shirt

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,240
BAM mumsy

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,899
I quit Bugsy claws Encounters of the

21
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,850
Third Kind now how can I fail I don't

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,390
know how I can fix oh geez I just don't

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,390
really want to do this but yeah I know

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:39,660
it's contracts in the sword I could

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,220
patent where you're wrong I don't know

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,259
you're pretty safe with the chapter one

27
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,450
called cheese wheels of doom so I'm

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,250
willing to wager that everything could

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,229
go wrong the first thing you'll notice

30
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,880
is that this game is a little something

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,460
I like to call a float game as in

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,850
everything's floating even Bubsy in fact

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,220
that's one of his main moves I find it a

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,080
bit curious that they designed a bobcat

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,039
to have two abilities jump and float

36
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,659
what kind of what kind of character

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,759
design is this it it'd be cool if he was

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,829
like yeah a flying squirrel or a bat

39
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,900
even then I'd have reason to feel

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,540
justified in gliding I mean when's the

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,370
last time you were hiking a freakin

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,610
Bobcat just came floating by it didn't

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,209
happen

44
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,640
it's gonna get happen I know some of you

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,890
might call that nitpicking but look how

46
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,799
stupid it looks it's a pantsless cat

47
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,350
little white exclamation t-shirt fucking

48
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,269
floating around like Mary Poppins and

49
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,260
our Akane

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,420
background is really disorienting just

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,220
watch when you jump up high it just sort

52
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,840
of stays put in all the platforms around

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,730
you completely vanish and it gives you a

54
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,140
pretty poor idea of where you reside

55
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,290
spatially also every single button jumps

56
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,750
that's a pretty good a location of your

57
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,299
buttons oh is that a save point let's go

58
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,550
check it out

[Music]

60
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,290
am i stupid I really thought that was a

61
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,959
save point think seriously doesn't that

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,610
look like a Midway save point to you

63
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,500
whatever you're right I forgot

64
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,420
gumball machines are the cause of 200

65
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,730
thousand deaths two years is serious

66
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,769
everything is just really shoddy then

67
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,480
the hit detection is weird the jumps are

68
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,430
hard to make it and what they're what

69
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,769
what killed me here I mean as you can

70
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,080
see there is a giant space in between me

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,420
and Steve Martin jr. here left one what

72
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,040
it feels like they wanted to make

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,870
something like Sonic the Hedgehog here

74
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,640
but the levels are built like it's Mario

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,250
he's got some sort of ice momentum going

76
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,110
on here if you start running he'll build

77
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,690
up ridiculous speed but since you die in

78
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,450
one hit your adventure is bound to end

79
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,310
in seconds it's like it even want you to

80
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,660
have fun with this game they wanted you

81
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,950
to feel like a four-year-old who just

82
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,629
ran out into the ice rink where a

83
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,140
frickin is frictionless beep oh

84
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,459
what's going on here bugs are you

85
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,180
feeling all right i melted was it

86
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,299
what's that falling damage they put

87
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,629
falling damage in their motherfucking 2d

88
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,920
platformer game

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,630
it's optional but you can take these

90
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,280
alternative paths that spice up the

91
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,690
gameplay a bit so let's see where this

92
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,220
one takes us

93
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,750

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,230
what it took like to the beginning of

97
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,730
the level who cares

98
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,600
okay how are you kid this game wouldn't

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,850
even be so bad if they slowed down the

100
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,710
pace of it and zoom the screen out

101
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,050
everything's to close up before you know

102
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,520
it you get pelted with something you

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,990
didn't even have a chance to react to

104
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,300
you never know what to expect next

105
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,190
you just gotta kind of carefully inch

106
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,770
along to beat this game an a that's just

107
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,890
no fun

108
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,290
nah no luck that no merit there is

109
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,240
falling damage in this game I'm not

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,990
crazy

111
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,090
you can't put falling damage in a

112
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,130
freaking black former that's like

113
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,250
putting ste gravy on skittles alright

114
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,960
almost done with this level just gotta

115
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,730
get a little Oh aah Oh jumping in a car

116
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,720
kill me

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,540
not Santa really that's the way we wash

118
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,830
our hands I'll take your hit bubsy I see

119
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,210
what you're saying to me don't you worry

120
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,790
we're on the same level Jesus let's try

121
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,850
Bugsy - maybe this one's a little better

122
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,140
what could possibly go wrong

123
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:33,220
yeah Bugsy - Bugsy 3 Bugsy fuckin - and

124
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,050
don't expect those amazing puns to stop

125
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,600
anytime soon if anything it speeds up

126
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,700
from here remember I am a trained

127
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:49,270
professional I'm not exactly sure what's

128
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,890
happening here on the intro screen but I

129
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,540
do know Bugsy turns around and is like

130
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,920
what the fuck is this shit

131
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,570
apparently though he likes it so I can

132
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,520
choose between one player grant or

133
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,470
whatever that is and play for points

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,720
yeah play for points gotta get that

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,300
gamer score up and post it the SNES live

136
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,600
yo yo Gary me bitch uh was the ending of

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,930
bubsy one that fantastical did some plot

138
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,550
development end up causing the bubb's

139
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,440
universe to become a 1984 esque

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,350
dystopian future well clearly one

141
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,250
thing's for sure

142
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,020
I got a pic from west wing and East Wing

143
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,970
never mind bubs you wanted bubsy to

144
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,740
overhear you know the whoever they are

145
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,780
so

146
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,160
what appear the bubs he's in some weird

147
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,660
place and he's got to go to all these

148
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,430
places and beat the levels don't worry

149
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,590
it's all very well explained well this

150
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,000
time around at least we got more buttons

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,010
to work with you can jump glide and use

152
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,020
an item now by far the best feature in

153
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,760
this game is whenever lovesy dies he'll

154
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,020
say the stupidest thing I've ever heard

155
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:55,380
in my life I'll be back oh oh keep it up

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,450
yeah Kay bet he'll make some quote from

157
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,830
a famous movie or something

158
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,720
although dissimilar to the likes of Duke

159
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,820
Nukem when bubsy makes these references

160
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,200
it's not in theory it's just annoying

161
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,180
the record strike over yet apparently

162
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,840
not bubsy apparently not wow they should

163
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,560
have called this game drug Z I mean wow

164
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,380
looks like it is on drugs what's going

165
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,730
on in this picture it's like some

166
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,880
Salvador Dali shit you got pig statues

167
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,669
and bouncing pigs and pig lady what is

168
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,010
this a was Pig world oh oh it's Camelot

169
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,180
it's Camelot good one Bugsy hey wanna be

170
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,490
a cast member on safe bird a Night Live

171
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,590
I know you'll make them meows damn it

172
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm leaving you Bugsy it's just like

173
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,010
they drew up about two hundred assets

174
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,450
and dump them all into this world with

175
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,120
no cohesiveness whatsoever I mean I

176
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,169
guess it seems like they're really

177
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,120
trying here but my god it's a

178
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,970
clusterfuck to the eyes I can't play

179
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,890
this it's like a fever dream why is he

180
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,440
doing that Liza what why is he doing

181
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,180
that poor what is the read what is the

182
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,190
reason for this it's hard to explain but

183
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,210
you don't get the same kind of

184
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,979
environmental feedback like you would in

185
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,690
Donkey Kong bubs he doesn't have much

186
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,220
weight or feel like he's really there so

187
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,539
it's hard to play in control

188
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,250
you'd have to be really young to get any

189
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,590
enjoyment out of this I mean bubsy two

190
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,900
is marginally better than bubsy one but

191
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,760
it's honestly only because of a better

192
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,830
art design okay this whole situations

193
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,450
starting to make me vomit my mouth too

194
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,880
bit so let's graduate to our final stop

195
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,710
on this journey

196
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,660
you don't want this you think you want

197
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,780
this now but trust me you don't want

198
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,370
this bubsy 3d for the PlayStation 1

199
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,380
apparently it's winner of the gold X

200
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,560
Award one of the sleeper hits a 96 ya

201
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,440
quote from the guy who made bubsy 3d run

202
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
jump swim and fly anywhere k your paws

203
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,620
on a mess of atoms for extra lives okay

204
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,020
hold the phone having one ups in your

205
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,780
game is not a selling point let alone a

206
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,690
bullet on the back of the box I mean you

207
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,090
can just tell they were really

208
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,830
stretching to say even one good thing

209
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,170
about this game play cat and mouse in a

210
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,750
unique two-player mode yeah okay hey

211
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,370
this games from the good old days where

212
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,930
the game manual is actually the cover of

213
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,910
the jewel-case and by good old days I

214
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,530
mean good lord is it hard to get this

215
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,180
thing out it's got these two little

216
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,380
bumps here that keep it from slipping

217
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,090
out and four pins holding it in place

218
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,920
there's really no easy way to get it out

219
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,660
not like you're gonna need instructions

220
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,880
on how to play bubsy 3d an instruction

221
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,590
manual on better game selection might be

222
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,380
more useful to you at this point I don't

223
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,630
want to do this I'm just letting you

224
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:39,440
know that this is a bad idea what could

225
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
possibly go wrong

226
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,760
whoa hey well now I think we know where

227
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,250
all the budget went so as it would seem

228
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,140
the bad guys in bubsy 3d are the

229
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,030
sneezing enemies from the first game and

230
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,950
like hell that's actually what they went

231
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,720
with as if they were like nah they were

232
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,070
the first enemies in the first one

233
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,780
that's it they have to be the main enemy

234
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,740
we can't come up with anything better

235
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,500
than this then fucking this dude

236
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,000
parallel universe Shigeru Miyamoto's

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
like the goombas stabbed the first

238
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,480
enemies seen the first game with this it

239
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,040
main villain five stars a plus four

240
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,380
stops man if these are the cutscene

241
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,140
graphics I don't know that I want to see

242
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,560
the real game bubsy is 3d in Forbidden

243
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,300
Planet

244
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,430
because talent

245
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,279
[Music]

246
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,009
well there you have it

247
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,290
Bugsy 3d now this is truly art right

248
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,120
here yeah you are looking at fine art

249
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,829
where do we even begin with this

250
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,899
obviously 3ds controls can't even be

251
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,269
categorized as bad the closer to

252
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,420
unfinished it's nonsensical how you move

253
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,399
in this game and it goes beyond every

254
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,350
gaming convention it's hard to explain

255
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,269
but you can't run around freely like in

256
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,250
Mario 64 you can only go straight

257
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,379
forward and straight back to turn you

258
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,579
literally have to move your trajectory

259
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,889
left and right and then go forward when

260
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,269
you got the direction you want to go in

261
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,699
turn this makes bubsy 3d feel more like

262
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,189
a freaking strategy game in a platformer

263
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:06,819
and oh don't you forget this game wants

264
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,410
you to know that this is the true

265
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:15,699
essence of a platformer hmm now if you

266
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,279
would just take a nice look at these uh

267
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,519
platforms

268
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,490
yeah that sure is a platformer all right

269
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,180
a non coloured non-political non-tech

270
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,170
stirred platformer bubsy 3d literally a

271
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,050
platformer Oh God

272
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,100
Oh God who looked at this and thought it

273
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,620
was okay this is what the alpha version

274
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,019
point 0 0 1 of a game should look like

275
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,779
not the finished product now it is true

276
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:46,209
that Mario 64 revolutionized 3d

277
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,620
platformers and changed the way we

278
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,750
expect them to function the mario 64

279
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,620
came out on June 23rd 1996 whereas this

280
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,550
game came out October 31st 1996 that's

281
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,319
about three months later and if you're

282
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,569
blaming the PlayStation one's 32-bit

283
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,220
limitations just take a look at Crash

284
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,589
Bandicoot still before bubsy 3d on

285
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,500
August 31st 1996 so let's talk about

286
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,600
jumping what do you jump and this is

287
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,939
every time you jump for some reason the

288
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,459
camera pans down at the ground I suppose

289
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:16,899
to help you see where you're gonna land

290
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,430
but after a while it just kind of gets

291
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,100
nauseating and obstructs your view there

292
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,600
were just so many poor design choices

293
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,399
here that it's impossible to count them

294
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,470
all off the top of my head I know don't

295
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,720
lose any sleep bubs he still says things

296
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,470
Oh does he ever still say things

297
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,230
hello holidays game designers wonderful

298
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,950
how truly ironic a game designers job in

299
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,720
most cases is a create a living world

300
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,490
that ceases to be fake in the mind of

301
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,050
the player and I mean think about it

302
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,000
even if the game constantly breaks the

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,860
fourth wall like in duke nukem or Monkey

304
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,840
Island the world is still believable

305
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,790
your suspension of belief kicks in and

306
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,170
your mind allows you to meld with the

307
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,520
game environment as if you were actually

308
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,400
there when a game like bubsy 3d makes

309
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,860
self-referential humor and it just seems

310
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,930
foolish having the designers of this

311
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,060
game refer to themselves as designers

312
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,700
and some just feels wrong about it game

313
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,540
very tight the morning though I mean

314
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,100
look at the walls on the ground it's

315
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,720
about as basic as you can get for

316
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,800
political game

317
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,360
Bub's he himself is the best looking

318
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,100
model in the game and even he has only

319
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,650
like five frames per animation I suppose

320
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,210
what your goal in this game is is to

321
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,860
find the 32 missing pieces of your

322
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,930
escape rocket or something there's 16

323
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,640
levels in this game so I suppose that

324
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,890
would be two rocket pieces per level the

325
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,480
game actually comes with a little map of

326
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,520
the first three levels high from way up

327
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,250
here it looks like sonic 3d blast almost

328
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,620
makes you feel a little bad someone put

329
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,300
their heart and soul into this game and

330
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,650
maybe it was really the best they could

331
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,360
do I mean they even named different

332
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,010
areas and gave the levels clever little

333
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,220
names like claws for alarm and

334
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,070
claustrophobic and catatonic catastrophe

335
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,350
that I just said felt bad we rephrase

336
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,200
that I feel bad for me you think I'm

337
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,230
skimping you here or something no this

338
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,560
is all there is to show there's nothing

339
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
more you just walk around this place and

340
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,200
grab atoms that's it and it's hard to

341
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,820
even grab them the hit detection is so

342
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,190
