13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,920
supposed to happen at all and number two

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,449

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,519
hat and every single goddamn time I'm

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,740
crossing this river I don't care what

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,080
y'all say I'm gonna put across here I

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,890
don't care how scary you think you is

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,140
gonna be me okay I'm taking shortcuts

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,689
and you horsey swoopy you're just gonna

22
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,729
have to suck it up and deal with it

23
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,700
okay that was will alright so we're

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,890
gonna move our way north because we need

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,290
to deal with the Native Americans that

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,750
are trying to get some help from the

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,700
government but oddly enough the

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,369
government in the 18th and 1900s not

29
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,680
being too very helpful in fact being

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,649
excessively harmful so let's see what we

31
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,610
can do about it

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,290
I forget what even they asked me to do

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,000
it's not like it's been forever although

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,770
judging by my new haircut which yes I

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,409
got a new haircut I might have been

36
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,540
years for all I know but I'm intent to

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,000
finish this game if anyone was curious

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,909
as far as the progress we've got going

39
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,360
we are apparently 46% done but I think

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,530
that's just because I haven't done too

41
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,959
many of the side quests which may or may

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,420
not have something to do with the store

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,490
then again maybe I have maybe I've done

44
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,200
so much at the syquest because I've done

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,280
pretty much everything the game has

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,260
asked me to do but that's mostly just

47
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,330
because I really like the game the

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,700
game's super duper fondness and I you

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,739
know when I say super duper you mean uh

50
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,930
you know I mean it hey how you doing hey

51
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:34,730

54
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,590
won't believe it it happened again it's

55
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:33,560
real deep yeah well don't you worry

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,480
about me I already got a stiff one for

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:43,280
tonight after that so funny that's so

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,829
funny every time I hear someone cry for

59
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,150
help I'm just gonna automatically go

60
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,430
into suck mode I mean ordinarily I'd

61
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,140
default the blow mode but when it comes

62
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,150
down to helping people in the wild wild

63
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,359
west I guess I got a cut engaging more

64
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:59,930
sucking than I anticipated anyway what

65
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,579
are we talking about something important

66
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:02,750
that we were doing but I can't even

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,090
remember what that is now so I'm just

68
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,060
gonna skip out on my way up north

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,069
in his beautiful beautiful country

70
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,410
somehow we just left the bayous how we

71
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,510
did that oh yeah I might want it over

72
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,860
here or is this just the edge of the

73
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,500
area where I was now cuz I killed like a

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,540
hundred people on the way out of that

75
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,820
trolley station and also we blew up the

76
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,430
trolley and also we ruined the town we

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,750
ruined pretty much everything in there

78
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,790
how are they gonna be happy with us the

79
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,340
answer is that they're probably not your

80
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,260
lucky day it's your lucky day you're

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,300
lucky I don't actually need money man

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,280
before it was like it was a gold mine

83
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,230
hunting of animals but then again it was

84
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,580
a lot easier to get the animal pelts

85
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,710
back to the town so they'd have to

86
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,630
actually carry them on my horse maybe

87
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,669
for the big ones you did I can't quite

88
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,650
remember what is going on here whoa whoa

89
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,389

91
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,540
important or is this nothing

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,700
where's the d DS back there but I was

93
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,450

look of that Gator but it's just gonna

97
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,940
have to wait because we got something

98
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,289
else in store for us why would we do

99

you shoved it into your side pocket okay

661
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,019

[Applause]

665
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,920

666
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:01,080
going out by yourself what happens if I

667

00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:32,089
waiting out in the middle of the swamp

684
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,759

00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,349
lead to something big because Hosea I

841
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,270
said this before but it seems like more

842
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,250
and more recently Hosea is starting to

843
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:39,950
have this rift between not my business

844
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:45,230

maybe that's what just ran out over

848
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:58,549
there it seems like Hosea is gonna like

849
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,079
their confrontation that's gonna reach a

850
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,450
head at some point it's not gonna be

851
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,039
good for this family they've got going

852

why not rob a bank sad on top of that of

998
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,509
course are you in the house Dutch

999
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:18,900
mandolin it's the right plan we've done

1000
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,290
the work I've been in town looking

1001
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:24,839
watching and and waiting I've tested it

1002
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,210
as well as I can it's the right plan I

1003
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:32,569
know I just well between you and me um

1004
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:34,020
nervous

1005
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,319
I suppose I suppose that's it never

1006
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,359
nervous that's been my job all these

1007
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:47,909
years I know you're sure certain not

1008
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:50,100
certain it will be done but certain it

1009
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,920
can be done and certain this is the only

1010
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,100
way I see we can do it I've timed it out

1011
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,819
more than once well you're the expert

1012
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:03,449
Jill look the bank karen Tilly Abigail I

1013
01:09:03,449 --> 01:09:04,980
sent them all hey I'll say the same

1014
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,870
thing there's no more than one armed

1015
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,960
guard and the police

1016
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,790
it's a city they're police but as far as

1017
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:13,710
we can tell the patrols will all be

1018
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,989
going this way when Abigail and I caused

1019
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:18,810
the diversion that's the opportunity you

1020
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:21,420
think Arthur I don't see we have a lot

1021
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,179
of choice we linger around here we know

1022
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:26,609
we're dead but the plan we got a decent

1023
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,940
bunch we know how to fight the city cops

1024
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,770
don't seem so tough as long as we move

1025
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:35,980
I reckon doing it in the day with a

1026
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,910
distraction

1027
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,920
that's what Hosea say it's just good a

1028
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,100
plan as any I think I agree

1029
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,930
we do it at night there's the DRAM of

1030
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,330
just getting into the bank can't do that

1031
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:49,270
silently no pick us off our reason I

1032
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:52,120
know I'm I'm just making sure every plan

1033
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,400
is a good plan if we execute it properly

1034
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,310
every problem we had was because we did

1035
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:01,000
not execute properly even Blackwater

1036
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,460
from my understanding you're right let's

1037
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,020
Rob this bastard

1038
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,480
everyone get some rest we ride out in

1039
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,280
the morning all right all right

1040
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,910
travel light I got a feeling Jose is

1041
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:27,880
setting us up and within six weeks we're

1042
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,220
living life anew in a tropical I don't

1043
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,320
spend in the last of our days as banana

1044
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,840
farmers let's get out of this

1045
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,760
godforsaken place and go rob ourselves

1046
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,990
up back I don't know I just got a bad

1047
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:47,170
feeling about this just seems I don't

1048
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,240
know some some don't feel right about

1049
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,730
this

1050
01:10:50,730 --> 01:11:04,180
know that don't feel right that word so

1051
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,460
devoid of imagination

1052
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,980
how soon are we shipping out soon as we

1053
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,200

1054
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,630
Argentina to another around the Cape

1055
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,810
what about the money in Blackwater we're

1056
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,989

01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:32,770
this isn't some hick town hundred dollar

1062
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:37,060
operation this is a big city bank right

1063
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:41,800
with security guards police mosaic is

1064
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,780
done is reconnaissance we've been over

1065
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:49,840

1066
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,780

fault good all right that's enough talk

1073
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:18,680
I got a bad feeling about this I got a

1074
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:34,430

1075
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:46,630

everything seems to be building there's

1080
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,050
no way that this can just go perfectly

1081
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:13,370
and I think Hosea was it was so

1082
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:15,650
insistent but Dutch Dutch had doubts

1083
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,690

01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,790

I blamed Hosea like a tool god dammit

1235

Hosea was a good one

01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:15,790
get down and stay out of sight

1244
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:18,250

1246
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,670
was gonna be bad but I just didn't know

1247
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:25,960
it's gonna be that bad and maybe I can

1248
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,460
just stab this guy in the heart and

1249
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,810
that'll make me feel a little bit better

1250
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,510
about it I mean I knew cuz this is a

1251
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,670
prequel I knew at some point John and

1252
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:35,320
Abigail they're gonna betray just

1253
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,610
because they want to live their normal

1254
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:46,890
life but maybe they didn't betray you

1255
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:48,570
I don't know if we're all gonna get out

1554
01:49:01,999 --> 01:49:04,579
