00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,930
you can be outside with a view like that

122
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,639
and still be alone

123
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:36,779
that's why it's special out here how

124

noon so that's good I went to the

127
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,390
grocery store at 5:00 and then I had to

128
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,560
call Roy to pick me up because I

129
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,910
