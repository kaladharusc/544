hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic guy

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,100
remember it so you don't have to there's

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,320
just something about nostalgic fantasy

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,810
books whether they make good film

7
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,580
adaptations or whatever Eragon was

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,380
there's always a part of us that has to

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,970
see what the cinematic version of the

10
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,100
most imaginative tales look like and

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,590
clearly the best director for a trippy

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,900
sci-fi Mindwarp about children traveling

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,400
to different worlds would be one who

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,559
specialized in films about prejudice and

15
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,440
race relations well that turned out

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,860
exactly what we got

17

[Music]

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,460
being immediately an already difficult

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,860
book to adapt with one time tries to be

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,600
that artsy kids film and to open up your

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,100
mind but instead turns out to be that

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,200
artsy kid that tries to open up her mind

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
with his ultimate interpretation of

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
Donnie Darko yeah you all know that

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,470
asshole they made a movie like him based

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,970
on the only kids fantasy books you

27
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,890
remember being more jesusÃ­ than narnia

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,660
the adaptations for this novel have

29
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,070
often been underwhelming and this

30
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,770
version is not underwhelming but how do

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,900
I put it remember that very pompous

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,240
ending to American Beauty where they say

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,850
you don't understand our film but don't

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,400
worry you will imagine that for two

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
hours but is there anything about it

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,530
that worked I mean without the use of a

37
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,450
slowly becoming legal substance well

38
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,030
let's take a look in more detail this is

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,830
the unsurprisingly bizarre but

40
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,570
surprising in the way it's bizarre

41
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,479
wrinkle in time the film opens with

42
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,250
Chris Pine and Mel Gibson's beard

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,500
showing his daughter Meg the ABCs of

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,959
pretentious speeches is always there

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,020
even if you don't feel it I want you to

46
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,280
remember that when you read the reviews

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:24,500
for this movie this is are enough gee I

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,150
wonder if that speech about love means

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,920
he's gonna disappear I'm gone dad later

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,890
tomorrow marks the four year anniversary

51
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,510
of the disappearance of massive

52
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,000
scientist dr. Alex Murray there are

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,760
still no leads in the case but perhaps

54
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,160
the biggest mystery why can two kids who

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
can have screens in front of them

56
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,160
literally through breathing listening to

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,390
radio

58
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,790
as a pop song indicates mega sad and

59
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,100
often me followed by mean kids who say

60
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,760
such terrible things as Jaime you get it

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,980
you can call me every variation of the

62
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,810
c-word you like but say hi to me you

63
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,430
better expect this and return it

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,070
hi Megan oh hi Marc trust me you'll be

65

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,670
best friend our gang is called the plot

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,340
devices anyway what do you make him fun

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,230
at her for it this is the kid asking for

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:32,290
it and she never mixes my medications at

73
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,720
all also unconfused

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,760
who's he talking about being awkward and

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,820
funny-looking the way meg is supposed to

76
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,000
be awkward and funny-looking oh god yeah

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,250
by Disney standards what a dog that she

78
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,930
is only on the cover for magazines

79
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,730
instead of five when will everybody

learn that beautiful people are

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,450
beautiful people she gets sent to the

principal for introducing the bully to

83
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,770
basketball because that's a problem the

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,840
principal would deal with and he tries

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,970
to give some advice you can't keep using

86
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,770
your father's disappearance as an excuse

87
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,850
to act out odds are he's not coming back

104
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,160
greatest minds in recent history

105
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,680
his personality is on par with man dark

but still smart cookie I do hope you

107

your toilet paper coat I'm really

109
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,419
confident in my weirdness which means

110
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,040
either escape from a place with bars on

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,310
the window I'm really cool I'm not

whether you're talking aren't you

115
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,980
what are you doing here I don't know I'm

116
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,840
introduced 15 minutes in I had no lines

117
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,000
and I had nothing to the story but I do

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,460
give this punchable look of whimsy every

119
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,050
five minutes so what do you say Calvin

120
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,160
you want to come with us

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,450
why not so ever wonder if that crazy cat

122
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,070
lady down the street was as insane as

123
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,560
you thought she was love without love is

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,750
like a tree without blossoms or fruit

125
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,630
Gibran Lebanese this is mrs. who played

126
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,530
by Mandi coming

127
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,120
Charles seems to have met her before and

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,620
explains how she only speaks in

129
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,840
obnoxious quotes he's just a ball the

130
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,900
past language so when she needs to think

131
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,940
she keeps and uses other people's words

132
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,410
oh that's evolving past language huh

133
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,370
because it kind of sounds like you're

134
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,660
just not smart enough to come up with

135
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,190
your own words so your use of famous

136
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,510
quotes calendar to give the impression

137
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,980
you're above everyone else

138
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,350
the wound is the place where the light

139
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,310
enters you Rumi person hey how about

140
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,260
this quote you do not need to quote

141
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,390
great men to show you all one I realized

142
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,860
the irony I'm using a quote to get that

143
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,910
across but I don't think she's smart

144
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,300
enough to realize that soon we tired her

145
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,000
out she was really tired it's tough

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,030
being that pretentious 24/7 they go back

147
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,680
home where Calvin gives more inspiring

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:34,240
faces is that his role as they discuss

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,800
how her death suggested that space

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,210
travel can be done through the right

151
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,190
frequency from your mind rather than

152
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,020
enduring the oppressive rules of time

153
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,419
and space we could wrinkle it

154
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,890
we don't need rockets we don't need

155
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,290
spaceships all you need is to tap into

156
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,750
the right frequency you just need your

157
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,000
mind you have to be really long-winded

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,860
and act like your superior above

159
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,870
everyone else speaking of which where's

160
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,570
Oprah

161
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:03,830
[Music]

162
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,300
finally a size and image that

163
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,389
encompasses all of Oprah's ego why be

164
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,479
president when I can be God your father

165
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,300
has done an extraordinary thing no human

166
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,189
has ever traveled so far out in the

167
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,169

call out in the universe a human call

171
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,629
they say the call must have come from

172
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,429
her father so they're there to help find

173
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:33,409

Lady gaga

177
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:42,979

and have faith in who you are okay that

179
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,389
last part is bullshit but Disney really

180
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:57,149
likes to throw that in very much so

181

the only good quote from Phantom Menace

they traveled to Mordor Stonehenge where

they come across the happy medium which

230
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,830
sounds like a New Age kid show on Bravo

231
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,030
well you obviously don't understand the

232
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,770
importance of ballots well not as much

233
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,650
as you use that stuff double we are

234
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,850
looking for men who's lost in the

235
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,040
universe well this one popped up right

236
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,540
away but give me some more information

237
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,670
they say they all have to think of makes

238
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,830
father in order to locate him but she

239
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,630
can because she doesn't see how that'll

240
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,050
help

241
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,300
well they don't understand how thinking

242
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,340
about him is going to help us find him

243
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,230
now flying vegetable ladies and ten

244
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,790
story talk-show host that I can believe

245
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,900
but they give my father

246
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,720
I just don't follow they explained that

247
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,400
they need her father to fight the it

248
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,470
from corrupting mankind and that gives

249
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,350
her the courage to find him with just

250
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,030
the happy medium wait what happened to

251
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:23,950
needing everybody they see the father

252
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,690
figure now teleporting but got captured

253
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,790
by the it so they decide to go back to

254
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,950
earth to figure out a plan makes will to

255
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,570
find her father is too strong though and

256
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,490
it redirects them to where the it is a

257
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,020
place where the Three Stooges have no

258
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,820
power so they have to leave you'll

259
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,060
encounter things you think you know but

260
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,600
you don't

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
it's a place to be suspicious now this

262
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,490
is especially disappointing because in

263
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,529
the book apparently the revealed to be

264
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,589
centaurs but my guess is heavenly Oprah

265
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,480
would die before being seen as something

266
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,240
such ungodlike but I of course would not

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,850
want to rob you of such an image so here

268
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,889
it is though present are we can barely

269
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,370
tester ourselves we must continue on

270
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,360
without us you must find your father

271
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,240
times like this I really love my job

but they escape via Kingdom of the

277
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,410
Crystal Skull fridge and try to figure

278
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,540

Fox's shut up me yeah everybody lost

311

turned into a puppet Club Med host and

313
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,020

317
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,860
forces him to talk more like a James

318
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,410
Bond villain that's so like you to try

319
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,490
to come to the rescue

320
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,910
isn't it Calvin always so helpful overly

321
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,570
carry pathetic honestly I can't decide

322
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,010
whether or not this makes things more

323
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,870
awkward or if it just fits right at home

324
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:48,120
with his performance watch this kid

325
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,580
could give - a run for his money he's

326
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,480
gone he's not gone I don't see you he

327
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,890
suddenly turned from the most annoying

328
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,790
part of the movie to suddenly the best

329
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,350
clever perhaps if you push back my

330
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,120
bedtime I won't have to push back

331
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,589
you're dead time make uses the glasses

332
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,180
though to find a secret entrance to

333
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,550
where her father is look out a genuinely

334
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,300
emotional scene

335
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:21,480
[Music]

336
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,709
even though this is a very touching and

337
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,990
well acted moment I have to admit I do

338
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,750
kind of what Porky Pig to jump out and

339
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,550
say that's all folks for a number of

340
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,130
reasons the movie would stop so the

341
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,959
father is back but that doesn't subtle

342
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,759
down Charles is acting at all I'm

343
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,250
underwhelmed I can see the witnesses of

344
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,250
any soul I take your soul so desperate I

345
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,350
want to bundle you up in a toy and call

346
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,620
you my little Hitler no cakes of all

347
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,440
sorts is worth this Charles throws them

348
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,180
in a dark realm where the it tries to

349
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:10,829
tempt Meg to join him oh my god she's

350
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,329
moderately better-looking honestly I

351
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,649
kind of think she looks better how she

352
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,440
is she of course resists and make tries

353
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,240
to snap Charles back to his quote normal

354
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:27,060
self

355
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,560
don't make me somewhat impressively

356
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,740
shake you in its mildly annoying it of

357
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,600
course works in charles's back as the

358
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,210
missus returned to give support some of

359
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,190
our best warriors have come from Earth

360
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,130
this is where we leave you to become

361
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,150
warriors on earth hmm

362
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,370
do you mean actual layers are getting

363
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,900
offended to feel superior on social

364
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,390
media she returns home in a beautiful

365
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,540
yet weirdly long transition home and the

366
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:04,150
family is once again whole now I might

367
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,890
have messed up a few parallel dimensions

368
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,240
it's a long story but I think I have

369
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,620
tribal blood in me now

370
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,780
huh I guess we're cool now for no reason

371
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,910
let's go eat something cakes of all so

372
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,740
what is your deal I couldn't have done

373
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,240
it without you windowsill and that was a

374
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,920
wrinkle in time all the right

375
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,630
ingredients for the wrong meal with the

376
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,660
wrong cook in a weird way I can see this

377
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,250
being one of those trippy movies that

378
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,380
kids look back on years later as a means

379
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,020
of opening up creative ideas but unlike

380
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,820
other films that did that like say

381
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,400
labyrinth or Fantasia this isn't going

382
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,130
to hold much value for adults visually

383
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,780
it's nice and it's got some interesting

384
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,880
concepts I'll even go out on a limb and

385
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,740
say the performances from everybody are

386
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,290
good if they were just in more fitting

387
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,420
movies Charles is acting could be great

388
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,429
in a kid's action film Calvin's acting

389
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,929
could be great in a Spielberg style

390
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,630
fantasy even the missis's could work and

391
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,510
maybe a fairy tale type genre but with

392
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,010
the exception of the main lead and her

393
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,780
father who really do hit their marks

394
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,730
perfect everybody seems like they're

395
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,770
giving their all just in the wrong

396
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,410
project because of that it's a little

397
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,690
entertaining and just how misguided it

398
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,910
is I don't know if that's the director

399
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,340
or Disney or whatever but it's a

400
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,800
fascinating lock up my guess is none of

401
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,540
the people who worked on this or kind of

402
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,370
have trouble finding work in the future

403
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,530
it just has to be a project that matches

404
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,750
their talents better as is though this

405
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,400
is a craziest journey through what the

406
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
hell's build that didn't make me think

407
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,130
but it did make me smile

408
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,170
five minutes tops a critic if you'll

409
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,390
excuse me there's a certain season

410
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,220
around the corner I need to get excited

411
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,330
for that's right matt'll wait this first
