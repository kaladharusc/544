my drone thing they're so hard to

43
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,530
replace the one one store that Dan found

44
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,080
that sells drones here in Dublin only

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,130

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,530
who only takes cash for like an eleven

47
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,480
hundred dollar piece of electronic if

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
is my fault for losing the drone

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,830
I do feel naked without a drone though

51
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,209
aerial cinematography is such a key part

52
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:28,700
of well

[Music]

54
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,370
we're here I'm here dan and I are here

55
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,379
in Dublin because I'm because I'm

56
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,030
attending the Dublin tech summit which

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,879
is this afternoon but why I'm only here

58
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,890
for like a day and while I was in

59
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,720
Montreal for like two hours and and

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,849
Chicago for like three hours tomorrow

61
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,440
we'll be in Belgium for half a day I

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,730
used to always accept the invitation

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,290
accept the opportunity to go to these

64
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,120
awesome events so it was a great way to

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,849
see the world and go to these events but

66
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,340
like in the last year between family and

67
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,739
work and everything else it makes it

68
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,349
hard to like use this as an excuse to

69
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,299
spend a week in Ireland or use it as an

70
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,669
excuse to spend a few days in Montreal

71
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:20,919
or Chicago so it's just these like quick

72
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:21,489
turns

73
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:22,810
I definitely miss taking time to like

74
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,120
embrace these new cities but in the same

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,340
respect you know priorities shift and

76
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:37,889
now my priority is being home

77
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:45,669
Casey did bad idea bad idea

78
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,919
working on this Daily Show for the last

79
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,499
15 days I've come up with a rhyme to

80
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,860
help me understand how to achieve on how

81
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,840
to achieve what we set out for every day

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,259
so if if the story b-roll and pretty

83
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,159
images take a backseat b-roll and pretty

84
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,529
in be role and pretty images take a

85
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,800
backseat when the story or narrative is

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:22,800
incomplete did you tell them your phone

87
