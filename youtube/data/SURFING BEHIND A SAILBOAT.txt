into a paper bag and put it in their mailbox and say please clean up after

68
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,479
they're replaceable to be totally honest I'm not entirely confident I'm going to

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,570
today

73
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,810
I don't think that makes it a failure but i wouldn't call it is sweeping

74
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:59,220
success either driven the string in quite some time

75
