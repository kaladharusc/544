it's definitely the biggest day for

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,809
three six eight ever today's gonna be a

11
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:45,530

[Music]

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,580
I'm crazy in here

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:12,880
[Music]

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
this is 3 6 8 looks a little different

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,350
right it looks like this because tonight

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,470
is the premiere of the Shawn Mendes

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,330
movie that Shawn and I made early this

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,430
summer my friend Zach and my friend

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,340
Brett and and we have like we have like

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,440
a hundred and fifty people coming here I

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,270
think a hundred of them are fans we

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,010
actually we did it we invited all the

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,390
fans did a hundred fans here but a

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,040
hundred and fifty people coming here

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,230
tonight to watch the movie

27
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:47,480
[Music]

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,970
and then here's why this is a big deal

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,330
beyond just the event at 360 see movies

30
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,470
like like this

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,660
Shawn documentary I know it's only 15

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,800
minutes and I know I made it for his

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,410
channel but this is like a an actual

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,510
movie where I had an actual crew I had

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,120
Bret I had exact it was the three of us

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,009
we were focused we had like real audio

37
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,970
and real cameras it looks beautiful and

38
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,790
that kind of filmmaking was the

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,100
filmmaking that defined my whole career

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,350
before I started YouTube before I

41
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,270
started vlogging so beyond all of the

42
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,010
excitement that's like physically

43
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,170
happening today

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,240
the fact that the movie is now out the

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,620
fact that you can click the link below

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,540
go to Shawn's channel and see this movie

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,750
the a YouTube video these take me a day

48
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,060
I have one day to make these videos in

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,340
that 14 minute 15 minute movie took like

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,750
me with two of the most capable

51
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,340
filmmakers in the world

52
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,530
Zach and Brett took us almost four

53
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,950
months to finish so it just feels it

54
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,080
just feels to be massive

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,930
Levi you've seen it it's amazing so good

56
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,340
