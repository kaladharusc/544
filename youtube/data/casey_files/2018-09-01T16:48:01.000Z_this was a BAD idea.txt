[Music]

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,530

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,780
scene of some sort this is no crime

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,180
scene at all just bluebloods the TV show

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,350

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,640
hard

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,559
hi dude I can't walk past this line

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,330
because I have like official gear oh no

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,670
this is what you call a picture car

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,500
that's not a real compliment but to have

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,700
a picture car like this in New York City

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,350
nians there has to be actual cops nearby

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,390
just in case someone gets confused I

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,160
think the real cops are over there I

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,089
can't tell though they don't look real

25
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:12,300
hot pretzels drop hot dog buns

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,660
a million reasons to love New York City

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,930
but like skateboarding into work and

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,280

necklace this is my new amulet highly

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,280
fashionable yesterday I was out of town

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,020
on a shoot on a big shoot that was

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,590
awesome

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,450
somebody came up to me on this shoot and

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,350
they said part of the reason why I moved

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,320
to New York City was because I was

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,670
watching your vlogs they're watching my

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,460
vlogs and all of the time lapses and all

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,890
of the footage of New York City is what

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,980
convinced them to move here that exact

42
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,970
conversation I have at least once a week

43
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,840
if not more

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,929
so it's been a little while since I've

45
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,650
uploaded and rather than explain why I

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,420
haven't uploaded I thought I would share

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,640
with you kind of what I've been thinking

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,540
I wrestle like on a daily basis I

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,840
wrestle with like existential thoughts

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,980
like what is the point why am i doing

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,900
everything that I'm currently doing and

52
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,150
TV little context of that it's like I've

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,420
got a grown kid I got a little kid not

54
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,000
to have another kid is YouTube channel

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,480
this office my company got my running

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,760
which is just crazy why do I run so much

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,330
my loving wife why do I wake up every

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,720
single day before 5:00 a.m. what am i

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,239
chasing and the answer is I don't know

60
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,069
and this isn't like some emotional cry

61
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,590
for help I am extremely happy I'm happy

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,080
right now I'm a happy person I'm I'm

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,930
grateful for everything that I have I'm

64
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,530
appreciative of what I am and and how I

65
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,549
got here

66
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,650
there's very little that I take for

67
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,920
granted but I want more I want to do

68
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,120
more I want and I want and I want in Y

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,769
like where does that come from

70
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:27,370
a B C they always BBC closing always be

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,980
closing always be closing one of my one

72
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,209
of my favorite creators one of my

73
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:34,930
favorite people

74
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,030
Ethan Klein he's like taking some time

75
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,609
off right now and he posted that he's

76
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:41,410
taking a little break because he felt

77
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,079
like he was chasing something instead of

78
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,450
appreciating what he had I really like

79
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,650
that I think it's poetic and that's

80
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,519
beautiful

81
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,150
see yeah ambition ambition is both a

82
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,459
curse and a blessing it's a blessing

83
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,250
because without ambition you're just

84
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,109
kind of treading water it's ambition

85
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:00,579
that makes you swim to places you could

86
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:01,389
never imagine

87
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,310
it's ambition that takes you everywhere

88
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,519
you would ever want to go but it's a

89
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,519
curse ambition is a curse because it's

90
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,889
not getting to that destination it's not

91
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,380
achieving what you hope to achieve that

92
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,080
satiates are satisfies your ambition

93
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,140
it's the actual chasing it's the do

94
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,970
ambition is only like the imaan sterlet

95
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,860
ambition is only fed if you're

96
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,380
constantly spoon feeding it the doing

97
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,050
not the accomplishing so every time that

98
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,970
someone who's really ambitious tries to

99
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,990
stop you've stopped feeling satisfied

100
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,240
the curse that is ambition always

101
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,180
demands more and I don't think that

102
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,850
everyone is cursed or blessed with

103
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,560
ambition I don't think that like

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,850
ambition is this universal North Star so

105
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,890
that brings me back to KC the

106
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,350
existentialist what's the point what is

107
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,930
the universal North Star what's the one

108
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,210
thing we're all chasing after and I

109
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,160
think like in my heart I genuinely think

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,900
that one thing that we are all pursuing

111
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,380
in life is happiness happiness is the

112
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,410
point happiness is the ultimate

113
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,600
accomplishment it's what we all want or

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,430
it's at least what we all should want

115
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,730
happiness and and happiness doesn't just

116
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,720
manifest as a product of ambition but it

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,140
can come from love or it can come from

118
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,680
calmness or it can come from whatever is

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,830
a sense of fulfillment what in life

120
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,960
gives you that and then thinking that

121
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,720
through like what makes me happy I you

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,580
know my family makes me happy my running

123
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,160
makes me happy wait yep before 5:00 in

124
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,280
the morning makes me happy and feeding

125
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,370
my unrelenting ambition with work makes

126
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,970
me happy so here I am back in the office

127
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,060
doing one thing that makes me happy my

128
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,360
North Star which is my work which is

129
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,210
making video and that that kind of

130
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,770
brings me to the next thing that I want

131
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,900
to share with you

132
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,370
so this morning for the first time in

133
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,400
the history of ever we took all the

134
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,350
white frosting off of the windows of the

135
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,340
368 retail store and now you can see it

136
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,790
[Music]

137
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,690

141
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,360
now technically we're not supposed to

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
open the doors yet we're missing

143
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,350
something called a crowd control permit

144
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,530
but considering there's no crowd outside

145
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,540
I feel like it's okay we don't really

146
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,040

147
