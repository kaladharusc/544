29
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,769
video about what it's like to be in a

30

place is how friendly everybody is you

40
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,230

doing and they say good how you doing

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:19,180

jacket and zipped it up but I think I

79
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,570
did a good job my scene involved bumping

80
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,620
into one of the main actors and I had to

81
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,690
bump into it like ten times I am a

82
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,480

movie but I can tell you this

108
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,140
being on a huge movie set like that is

109
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,800
so much fun and there were good snacks

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,710
in the end which is great because I you

111
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,060
know I was a little nervous about that

112
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,560
but it was great

113
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,890
there's so much fun do you have a second

114
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,440
I have a couple questions okay all right

115
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,420
I'm making like a YouTube video from

116
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,450
that I shot on set and I just wanna I

117
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,280
just want to run a couple things by you

118
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,310
to make sure I'm not breaking any rules

119
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,720
okay so I don't mention the title right

120
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,140
can I mention who's in the movie I don't

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,120
really have I don't have any shots from

122
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,820
on set nothing on set nothing with

123
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,230
anybody else that's in the movie I think

124
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,630
about what my role is in the movie I

125
00:07:41,630 --> 00:08:03,260
never mentioned who the stars I agree

126
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,600
I've not had no title I didn't mention a

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,020
title okay bye

[Music]

129
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:25,319
movie stars the great Jamie Foxx and I'm

130
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,710
in a scene with the great Jamie Foxx and

131
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,380
let me tell you something that guy is

132
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,719
intimidating he's also extremely

133
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,880
handsome and he's a very good actor I'm

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,169
a terrible actor

135
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,640
I don't know how to act at all and he

136
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,250
and I did our scene together I can't

137
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,959
tell you the details but I was terrible

138
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,520
and he was amazing

139
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,709
so hopefully the directors can like edit

140
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,620
around my horrible acting but Jamie Foxx

141
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,390
I hope you get to see this YouTube video

142
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,430
and I hope we're cool like I was trying

143
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,839
my hardest on said I know I wasn't very

144
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,810
good but like I was trying

145
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:15,000
