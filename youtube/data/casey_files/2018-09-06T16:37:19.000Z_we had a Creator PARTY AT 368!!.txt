three six eight for the very first time

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:42,839
that's what I'm trying to say we still

9
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,269
haven't figured out like a lot of the

10
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,620
details when it comes to how we want to

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,510
activate the community here at three six

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,339
eight and that's largely because we

13
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:52,199
still don't really have permission to

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,019

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,460

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,970

Thank You Jo for sending me these

gummies I just hate six packets of them

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,950
I feel a little like I'm gonna go ahh

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,140
part of three six eight probably the

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,659
aspect of three six eight that I'm most

41
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,509
excited about is what we're calling like

42
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,909
the incubator side of the company an

43
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,789
incubator like a technology incubator is

44
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,860
when is when like a founder somebody

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,270
with an idea becomes part of this this

46
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,290
organization called an incubator and

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,390
they're that individual is given

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,030
resources and access to information and

49
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,130
gets networking opportunities and given

50
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,010
the tool to take his or her idea and

51
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,250
learn and figure out and take it from an

52
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,160
idea to a company a YouTube incubator

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,250
would effectively be taking like a

54
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,450
aspirational youtuber somebody who wants

55
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,380
to be a youtuber and taking them from

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,370
wanting to be a youtuber and helping

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,549
them to become a youtuber and I think

58
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,530
three six eight or companies like three

59
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,840
six eight could be all over the world

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,700
and they could be these these entities

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,510
were in people who have dreams of

62
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,430
becoming a youtuber can solicit

63
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,440
resources and become part of something

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,700
bigger than just themselves and

65
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,329
ultimately realize their ambition now

66
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,760
we're we're still a long way from being

67
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,130
there but a great way to start is by

68
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,340
doing little get-togethers where similar

69
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,530
minded creators can chitchat with one

70
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,810
another get to know new people discuss

71
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,150
ideas and let things snowball from there

72
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,260
so in the long game I hope 368 becomes

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,890
that and that's our ambition but for

74
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,780
right now I mean for literally today

75
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,989
we're just having like a some tacos

76
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,720
tonight so people can just try to get

77
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,609
together we can chitchat super casual

78
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,140
it's not even it's just like it's just a

79
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,820
couple of my friends from the city but

80
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,900

completely losing her what's up I'm so
