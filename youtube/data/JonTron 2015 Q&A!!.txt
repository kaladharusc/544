1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,210
Wow what a year it was so now that

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,980
Starrcade is wrapped I'm gonna be taking

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,049
a small hiatus I know it's I just came

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,540
back to jontron but I need a little time

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,130
to recuperate this has been a long year

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,900
it's the holidays and I'm just gonna

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,490
take a little break take some time off

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,049
get reacquainted with what I want to do

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,160
and then I'll be back into making videos

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,600
and actually do have some surprises for

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,369
you in store next year I'll be working

12
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,710
at all that soon but just excuse the

13
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,850
brief breaking videos there might be a

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,340
few in there but the main stuff I'm

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,750
gonna be putting off for just a little

16
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,490
bit not too long so before I take any

17
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,840
sort of breaks I'm going to be given a

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,399
little Q&amp;A session here to answer any

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,329
questions you may have had about the

20
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,850
past future or present of my show or me

21
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,620
any weird dirty questions I know you're

22
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,460
gonna ask about me I'm gonna answer them

23
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,780
I asked you guys commenting around a

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,059
thread and you did and so now I'm gonna

25
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,510
read them and answer first question AC

26
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,820
fan 120 asks how was recording bending

27
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,649
to starcade with aaron ross Holly and

28
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:53,879
everyone else yeah that was actually

29
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,600
really fun

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,760
I hadn't seen Aaron in a while and so

31
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,010
you know it was sort of just like a real

32
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,870
reunion of sorts and it turned out

33
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,219
pretty good I thought we had a lot of

34
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,329
fun it was good

35
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,010
maybe Micmac e asks will you be

36
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,600
releasing any Starrcade bloopers

37
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,189
actually I might there's a lot of stuff

38
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,000
that like if you watch the trailer

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,439
you'll see didn't make it in the final

40
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,540
cut and there's just a lot of stuff I

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,830
might release like bloopers and lost

42
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,560
episode kind of thing but and yeah

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
there's it's actually quite quite a lot

44
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,330
of bloopers because it was like my first

45
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,810
sci-fi show and we messed up a lot lost

46
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,880
the game asks for the love of God where

47
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,509
is the Hat

48
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,189
okay the Hat I don't know I just stopped

49
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,200
wearing that you stopped wearing a hat

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
once yeah it's like that psycho duck

51
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,400
from Canada asks why isn't jock in more

52
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,780
videos is it because you don't want him

53
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
to get overused or is it true what they

54
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,049
say about never work with animals it's

55
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,729
actually a little bit of both because if

56
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,079
you watch some of my older videos where

57
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,520
I actually just did the show with

58
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,759
Jacques he just always like it was like

59
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,280
chewing on my ear or my eye or face or

60
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,110
something and it's funny it was really

61
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,180
funny but like that joke would get old I

62
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,979
think if I just every episode have

63
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,250
chewing on my face and also the the

64
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,869
robotic voice I use I feel like it

65
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,600
doesn't fit it doesn't have it's not the

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,250
best comedian it doesn't have very good

67
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,290
comedic timing so like I can't it's very

68
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,940
situational when I can use him and yeah

69
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,280
also he's a bird so he's absolutely

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,599
untamable you can only

71
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,920
film with them for like a few seconds at

72
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,930
a time which actually shaped some of the

73
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,269
earlier John Tron's because I was forced

74
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,180
to do the lines quickly and like just

75
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,439
because I had to do it before the bird

76
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,689
would like fly away or walk down me or

77
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:26,370
something and I just didn't want to make

78
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,629
the videos like with those sorts of

79
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:28,950
constraints anymore so that's one of the

80
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,719
biggest reasons Rock is not in his many

81
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,549
things he's not dead he's not games in

82
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:33,750
the video is not dead

83
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,969
popular hat asks to piggyback off this

84
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,639
did jock die see that was the next

85
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,030
question I didn't even know it he's

86
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,519
trying to tell you right now Jason from

87
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,349
Georgia asks what caused the production

88
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,269
value of your show to go up so far also

89
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,349
are there any plans for anything like

90
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,480
Starrcade in 2016 well if you're talking

91
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,400
about Starrcade or jontron they're

92
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,530
they're separate entities because star

93
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,169
can I do with maker studios and jontron

94
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:00,120
is just I independently funded so

95
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,669
Starrcade had a budget jontron like I'll

96
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,049
reinvest the money I get from the show

97
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,299
back into it as much as I can I just

98
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,939
want to make it better and that's my way

99
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,290
of trying it's pretty much as a

100
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,400
consequence of the show picking up

101
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,290
momentum over time drew from Australia

102
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,060
asks John what was your favorite skip to

103
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,099
film slash watch from Starrcade that Han

104
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,810
dance finale had me in stitches for at

105
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,590
least 20 minutes

106
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,810
well first off thank you and second of

107
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,849
all on a sick tent dance was my favorite

108
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,759
thing because um we wanted it to build

109
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,049
well I wanted to build up to that

110
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,629
because that was like in the Star Wars

111
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,549
connect video that was actually like one

112
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,229
of my favorite old videos I made like

113
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,909
when I made it specifically like I was

114
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,040
really like I was just happy with it

115
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,139
because I liked that at the time it was

116
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,299
topical I really thought it was funny to

117
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,819
tie it all back into that like semi

118
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,859
jontron nostalgia so I'd say that was

119
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,689
like the big build up and and we filmed

120
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,810
it I think it it wasn't the last shot we

121
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,250
filmed actually but it was one of the

122
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,870
final shots we filmed so it was also

123
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,819
after a culmination of like six months

124
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,799
of shooting Starrcade and it was

125
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,030
probably my favorite scene and you know

126
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,290
Ross and Holly were there too

127
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,930
and all the cool characters with great

128
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,169
costumes were there on that Star

129
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,729
Destroyer Empire throne room set

130
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,680
Emperor's throne room set that was cool

131
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,599
so yeah just that well pretty much the

132
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,680
whole final scene but the dance

133
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,380
specifically real lemon ninja asks why

134
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,229
are you so hot well the fat keeps in the

135
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:21,449
temperature doesn't let out the cold so

136
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,469
it gets sweaty

137
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,300
dogsy asks do you think you'll ever do a

138
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,990
top-10 list ever again

139
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,310
it'd be really interesting to see one

140
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,080
with the new jontron flare and polish I

141
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,120
never say die but I don't I don't

142
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,310
foresee any top tens in the future maybe

143
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,050
if something really strikes me Spencer

144
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,490
from Texas asks does it feel a bit

145
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,110
strange and not natural to work on sets

146
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,759
now I totally understand the benefits of

147
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,870
it I just mean in the sense where

148
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,669
jontron came from originally compared to

149
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,620
now I wouldn't say it was weird uh just

150
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,940
pretty much a natural progression I

151
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,979
worked on you know sets both

152
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,630
professionally and in high school and my

153
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,729
when I you know started doing this kind

154
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,650
of stuff in you know high school theater

155
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,650
so I always like sets and I always

156
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,780
wanted one so no I wouldn't say it was

157
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,580
weird midnight link asks did you ever

158
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,320
get a response from Takeshi Kitano I'll

159
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,849
watch that video once in a while and

160
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,669
wonder I did not know but that beautiful

161
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,690
Japanese man owes me a letter

162
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,190
fuck ninety nine zero asks will you be

163
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,570
streaming more I don't know I don't

164
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,490
really fancy myself a streamer I do it

165
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,990
every now and then for fun every time I

166
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,310
do it people say they want me to stream

167
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,720
or but I don't know how many people

168
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,610
actually thought Pitts three more I feel

169
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,349
like if I don't know how I'd be

170
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,669
entertaining day after day doing that

171
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,440
but maybe I'll stream a little more in

172
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,889
the future

173
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,659
sighs mcpixel one asks what are your

174
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,639
thoughts in the new battlefront actually

175
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,590
very ironically I have not played the

176
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,090
final version yet but I have played a

177
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,009
lot of the beta and I played like when I

178
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,530
went to do the Walmart thing the ad at

179
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,090
Walmart I played it there I think they

180
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,009
had the final version and I I liked the

181
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,300
game I know it's gotten some criticism

182
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,690
for the DLC packs or something like that

183
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,449
but I don't I I can't judge the game the

184
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,650
final game but I had a lot of fun when I

185
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,900
played the beta and I'm still gonna buy

186
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,449
it in some night I'm Murdoch moody asks

187
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,190
hi John I was wondering if when you are

188
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,690
making your show you script a lot of

189
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,460
your dialogue or if it's improvised and

190
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,169
edited I imagine it's a mix of the two a

191
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,849
breakdown your process for filming would

192
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,320
be awesome yeah like you said it's

193
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,000
pretty much a mix of the two I mean it

194
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,009
has a script and a structure that we

195
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,020
that I you know put in there but then

196
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,669
like you know something might actually

197
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,740
come come out kind of improv like I

198
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,880
might just change the line on the spot

199
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,699
and a lot of times that that that's like

200
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,969
fan favorite lines like um I never man

201
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:24,430
shit whatever that line was like I think

202
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,349
I wrote that at all in the script I

203
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,849
think I just said it

204
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,800
I could go back and look in the script

205
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,960
and I really sure the dead conspiracy

206
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,190
asks how are you doing

207
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,539
fuck you dude I how are you luminescence

208
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:38,950
music

209
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,330
asks Ross said something on Twitter

210
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,380
about how in the final scene of

211
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,030
Starrcade you and Aaron were just add

212
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,530
living for half an hour was there any

213
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,940
other hilarious footage they didn't make

214
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,560
the final cut yeah like I previously

215
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,060
mentioned there's like a ton of footage

216
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,500
in Starrcade ii didn't make the final

217
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,290
cut because we it's just it was a mess

218
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,360
but the ad libbing yeah there was a lot

219
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,730
of ad libbing and there was some I think

220
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,500
you got the best takes like the raccoons

221
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,150
line I remember even being on set I was

222
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,040
like we're gonna have to keep that one

223
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,020
in so that made it in but yeah there was

224
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,760
like tons of like random stuff we said

225
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,110
back and forth maybe one day I can just

226
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,620
release it and and you can see all the

227
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,050
you know the funny stuff it's reps and

228
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,460
asks when is rocking time gonna come

229
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,040
back I legitimately lost that rock like

230
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,320
I I was surprised that was like real in

231
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,340
the video when I say how do you lose a

232
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,450
rock I meant that I

233
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,490
I seriously look for that rock even like

234
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,050
I even look for just like maybe if the

235
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,900
face washed off in the rain or something

236
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,700
I still look for the rock and I can't

237
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,330
find it

238
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,340
I honestly don't know where I went and I

239
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,750
just find that funny cry wolf

240
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
nine-one-one asks so what was the reason

241
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,420
for changing to a higher production

242
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,220
value style for the show do you think it

243
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,330
may have to track him in any way

244
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,770
what camera are you shooting on right

245
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,000
now I wouldn't say there was any

246
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,830
specific reason other than I wanted to

247
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,910
keep you know making bigger better

248
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,040
things and I just thought that was a

249
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
part of the equation there I personally

250
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,250
don't think it attracts from the show I

251
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,200
see what some people mean like the older

252
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
videos have like this very like

253
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,010
voyeuristic like I put a camera in your

254
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,680
bathroom watch you taking a shit feel to

255
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,320
it but maybe that's a little too far i

256
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,150
but I don't know I just I don't think it

257
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,310
attracts more personally and feel free

258
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,570
to disagree with me but I don't think so

259
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,250
we use a we use different cameras for

260
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,290
different shots but most of the stuff

261
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,330
was shot on a Blackmagic 4k cinema and

262
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,800
the last few episodes of jontron and

263
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
actually that's the same camera that we

264
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
used to film Starrcade as well

265
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,140
captain 0du asks what got you inspired

266
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,060
to make the jontron show all those years

267
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,650
ago I guess I just felt that there

268
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,570
weren't too many shows out there like it

269
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,220
that we're doing you know a certain kind

270
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,190
of style and I just wanted to try to you

271
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,130
know put one out there and who knows how

272
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,620
that ended up being anything gaming

273
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,510
enforcer asks what programs do you use

274
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,550
to edit all your videos generally I use

275
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,530
Adobe Premiere we use the Creative Cloud

276
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,720
version right now it's like the one

277
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,640
that's always constantly updated but I

278
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,530
use the Adobe suite you know After

279
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,570
Effects Photoshop Premiere those are the

280
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,580
three main

281
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,250
grams I use Chad tronic biggest fan asks

282
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,410
what job / hobby would you have if you

283
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,300
quit YouTube it's hard to say but I

284
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,650
don't think I would have a different job

285
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,060
well because if I quit YouTube I would

286
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,740
just be probably doing entertainment in

287
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,570
a different capacity for like I would

288
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,860
try to be doing it for television or

289
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,440
something or films but or even maybe

290
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,790
theater although I don't think theatre

291
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,280
cuz I should talk I think I would I

292
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,090
would have probably stayed in

293
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,940
entertainment because uh daddy ain't

294
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,060
good at much else mettaton smex asks how

295
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,260
hard was it to recreate all the

296
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,060
memorable Star Wars sets for Starrcade

297
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,590
and did you have any difficulties and

298
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,970
restrictions when writing the scripts

299
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,400
filming episodes etc um as for the sets

300
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,900
you know we had professional set

301
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,210
designers do that believe it or not I

302
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,340
didn't do it myself we determine what

303
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,930
sets in the script writing that we

304
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,490
wanted and we went ahead and tried to

305
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,630
find the most efficient way to build

306
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,280
those the two biggest ones obviously

307
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,020
being the Millennium Falcon and I guess

308
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,130
the hot there hallway in the movies

309
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,510
extends longer obviously they built it

310
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,890
out much bigger in the films but like it

311
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,420
was just a section of the Millennium

312
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,580
Falcon and the Emperor's throne room I

313
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,670
think that we built a pretty big septum

314
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,400
whose show is it I made you a star I

315
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,060
could take you out as well yes as far as

316
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,650
the as the restrictions and the script

317
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,910
and stuff there were some guidelines I

318
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,070
had to follow so that was kind of a

319
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,210
challenge in itself that's a whole

320
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,290
different story for another day though

321
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,500
so uh I'll probably go in-depth on that

322
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,340
that's another point

323
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,590
King David 73 asks do you have a day job

324
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,300
other than YouTube I only ask because

325
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,130
other Pro youtubers put out multiple

326
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,700
videos a day

327
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,350
I wouldn't think it would be possible to

328
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,610
fully support yourself on YouTube

329
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,470
otherwise I'm always curious what

330
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,180
youtubers do other than YouTube no

331
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,890
actually this is my job it's just my

332
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,750
full-time job I think just um my videos

333
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,400
just take a while to make I know I don't

334
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,170
upload as frequently as other youtubers

335
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,600
but the sponsorships that I get helped

336
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,930
the whole process ryan 707 for asks do

337
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,070
you have any other plans for making

338
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,170
content besides jontron like something

339
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,550
that can be easier to make and upload it

340
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,170
more frequently I think about this a lot

341
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,370
because sometimes I feel like I kind of

342
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,810
fall behind because like my videos come

343
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,270
out so infrequently and that it sucks

344
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,790
for me to like actually Starrcade yeah

345
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,080
that show went through absolute

346
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,700
production health and the plan

347
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,230
originally was much different it was

348
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,940
supposed to come out one episode every

349
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,730
week when it first launched but I knew

350
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,790
wasn't going to work so I had to go back

351
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,710
and you know

352
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,720
like we need to change this it's not

353
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,720
going to work and that led to some but

354
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,800
yeah basically I didn't want to make

355
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,870
more content that that year but like it

356
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,000
just was so all-encompassing and like

357
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,290
John trans were supposed to come out

358
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,210
underneath or like between stark aides

359
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,670
but it just didn't happen that way it

360
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,780
was a lot more work than anybody

361
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,630
anticipated and just the editing process

362
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,190
took way longer than I thought it was

363
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,650
going to so I ended up making like just

364
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,270
arcades for a long time which confuse a

365
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,430
lot of people and I understand because

366
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,900
you know it's weird to have a channel

367
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,690
like mine that's broad go to Star Wars

368
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,970
for like the whole year I do I do get

369
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,230
that and it wasn't supposed to be that

370
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,360
way but you know live and learn so I do

371
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,100
want to make more short form stuff for

372
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,480
sure

373
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,520
and not short form but I want to make

374
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,170
more frequent content I probably will in

375
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,580
2016 I have a lot of plans

376
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:55,130
Sylas one 301 3 asks I love you that's

377
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,570
not a question

378
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,180
Tom K video asks how far in advance did

379
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,470
you plan to have Aaron in the finale of

380
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,030
Starrcade and did you anticipate a

381
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,230
certain niche in the internet to lose

382
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,940
their minds we planned that shit all the

383
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,460
way back in February of 2015 so that's

384
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,290
what I was like 10 months before it

385
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,900
launched and what it was killing me I

386
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,820
really that was like all year I was

387
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,140
looking forward to it it's like all I

388
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,510
could talk about was just be like when

389
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,090
this finale hits yeah I was expecting it

390
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,310
to have a big reaction because you know

391
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,290
there's a lot of people who were you

392
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,950
know worried about the whole game grumps

393
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,410
split which yeah we didn't handle it so

394
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,930
good did we hey I made a cool finale out

395
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,340
of it so it might forgiving Mike hi asks

396
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,660
if I had one bullet and I had to shoot

397
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,910
the real jontron or an evil jontron how

398
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,020
would I know I was shooting the right

399
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,450
jontron easy cuz the real John trout

400
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,720
would scream like a baby and say don't

401
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,550
done please it's not me it's him so

402
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,260
thanks for watching this I'm really bad

403
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,510
at q and A's I hope this did some

404
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,890
justice I don't know I don't feel like

405
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,940
it's hard for me to answer these

406
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,230
questions but anyways there was one

407
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,700
thing I wanted to address I know it's

408
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,530
probably real vocal minority but I just

409
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,790
wanted to say the ads at the end of my

410
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,250
videos don't in any way like impact

411
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,720
because I see a lot of people saying

412
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,540
like you know oh so I know that's just

413
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,730
like a standard like complaint but for

414
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,080
instance like the food game the food

415
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,970
games video the only sponsor will ever

416
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,270
to

417
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,040
so the only sponsors there that were

418
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,800
crunchy well in Linda and and so like no

419
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,570
like McDonald's or whoever didn't didn't

420
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,920
sponsor that video in fact I took a risk

421
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,750
just putting those brands in because you

422
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,610
can get in trouble for that so you know

423
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,490
I just wanted to say that like the

424
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,560
sponsors I choose are there a people

425
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,140
that I think would benefit you like if

426
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,640
you use their service like I only pick

427
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,260
good services I don't sell scams like we

428
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,540
you know you can ask any youtuber we get

429
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,490
like tons of scam offers every day like

430
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,120
weird

431
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,209
just click baby weird offers I don't

432
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,649
take anything like that I learned with

433
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:46,850
these companies who have a good track

434
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,980
record like audible for instance one

435
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,120

436
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,529

437
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,240
you're supporting the show because they

438
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,040
let me do you know have creative freedom

439
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,709
and then I can I use the the sponsorship

440
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,690
money to to fund you know the production
