1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,180
ItS tImE tO sToP!

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,220
Everybody!

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,640
Sometimes in life things just go too far.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,000
And we have reached that point, everybody.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,680
TikTok videos, that's right!

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,040
How many more videos am I gonna milk from this?

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,080
As lOnG aS oNe MoNetiZeS!

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,200
I need that TikTok ad revenue!

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,920
It's like they give it to you and take it away!

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,000
Anyway guys, let's threw some cringy TikTok videos!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,300
Maybe I'll be Tracer.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,220
I wanna be Winston.

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,460
What about Widowmaker?.

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,400
I wanna be Winston.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,300
I'll be Bastion.

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,480
I wanna be Winston.

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,800
You're right so Winston.

18
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,880
I wAnNa Be WiNsToN.

19
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,260
I guess I'll be genji.

20
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,580
I wanna be Winston.

21
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,700
You see what I mean?

22
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,480
I.. ah.. a couple weeks ago we saw this trend on TikTok.

23
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,180
Kids are starting to parody these dumbass TikTok videos.

24
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,880
Now it's just gone full circle.

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,660
There's no actual content left.

26
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,580
It's just kids trolling each other.

27
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,820
99% FoRtNiTe DaNcEs...

28
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,220
And I don't even know *uhh* what to describe some of it.

29
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean at this point no one is making actual TikTok videos.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,980
I can't find actual TikToks.

31
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,700
But let's go - But let's just jump into it!

32
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,340
I WANNABEWINSTON. (you've seen this before)

33
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,920
(So how are y'all today?)

34
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,400
(Good?)

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,320
I wanna be Winston.

36
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,520
You're right so Winston.

37
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,620
I wanna be Winston.

38
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,840
I guess I'll be genji.

39
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm wanna be Winston.

40
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,100
Then I'll be McCree.

41
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,120
I wanna be Winston.

42
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,760
The thing is I - I'm clearly way too old to look at this stuff.

43
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,680
That girl, by the way, is the same girl that does that stupid muffin song.

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,420
And I cant show the muffin song because the video will get claimed. (Oof)

45
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,860
but dont tell me, I warned you.

46
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,520
Cause this S**t is about to blo-

47
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,320
(Wubbing sound effect)

48
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,800
They say legends say if you watch.

49
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,700
This video for too long you will actually.....

50
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Contract...

51
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,320
Not living. (Oof)

52
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,620
(Singing)
Have you heard of LGBTQ+.

53
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,620
(Singing)
Well I am the B.

54
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,120
As in Ben Shaprio.

55
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,620
&gt;&gt;Pewds laughs&lt;&lt;

56
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,620
Destroying libtards one at a time.

57
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,620
With pure facts and knowledge.

58
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,200
&gt;&gt;HEh&lt;&lt;

59
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,760
Oh thats great
&gt;&gt;Laughing continues&lt;&lt;

60
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,260
Ben Shaprio has infiltrated TikTok everybody!

61
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,340
(music abruptly starts)

62
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:01,900
(Royalty free music everybody)

63
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,400
(punching sound)

64
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,580
(music continues)

65
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,860
(music continues)
&gt;&gt;PewDiePie laughs in silence&lt;&lt;

66
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,540
*Heh*

67
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,080
Hitting women is never okay...

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,420
Never hit a child...

69
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
What would you do?

70
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,520
If there was a child right in front of you?

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,480
(Punching sound effect)

72
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,880
Its so good!

73
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,300
She clearly is playing along with it.

74
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
You can't go ehddadaba alright?

75
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,640
(music)
Maybe I'll be tracer?

76
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,880
(music)
I'm already tracer.

77
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,820
(music)
What about widowmaker?
&gt;&gt;*pfft*&lt;&lt;

78
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,320
(music)
I'm already-

79
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,660
&gt;&gt;hiccups&lt;&lt;

80
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,440
&gt;&gt;Breaths in&lt;&lt;

81
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
Ah, I love the guy with the TV.

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,780
(music)
-Bastion.

83
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,900
(music)
NeRf BaStIoN.

84
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,500
(music)
You're right s-

85
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,640
When earth is gone, when its been swallowed.

86
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,900
By a black hole of the sun itself.

87
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,900
This video will still be going.

88
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,600
There will still be kids.

89
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,500
Making replies to this one.

90
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,980
What if, what if like-
 Man I'm getting some weird ideas.

91
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,300
Kids keeping using *Ta*- TikTok it becomes this phenom-phenom...

92
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,180
Fah- you know what...

93
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,000
Nevermind. &gt;&gt;pfft&lt;&lt;

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
(music)
Oh great its this one...

95
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,300
(music)
&gt;&gt;Pewdiepie singing: Hit or miss.&lt;&lt;

96
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
(music)
&gt;&gt;Pewdiepie singing: Guess they never miss huh?&lt;&lt;

97
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,340
(music)
&gt;&gt;Pewdiepie singing: You got a boyfriend I bet he doesn't kiss ya!&lt;&lt;

98
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,880
(music stops)
&gt;&gt;This is a dude?&lt;&lt; (Oof)

99
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,580
*Eh* Whaat?

100
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,840
Whaat?

101
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,900
This is a perfect summary of-of Tik Tok.

102
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Cuz first of all, it's not a dude. (phew)

103
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,040
Second of all, the fact that people think its a dude is the reason why this video is popular.

104
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,180
Give that- give that some thought for a minute... (but I cant count to a minute..)

105
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,280
(Video plays) Okay, the bullying #### on this app has gotten WAAYY outta hand! Y'all need to grow!-

106
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,780
&gt;&gt;Pewds mocking man&lt;&lt; OkAyYEe*heh*

107
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,560
&gt;&gt;Pewds back in normal voice&lt;&lt; This is the alternative version of me.

108
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,960
If I- if I did TikTok videos instead of Youtube, this is how I would end up.

109
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,760
&gt;&gt;Pewds in mocking voice&lt;&lt; ThE bUlLyInG oN tHiS aPp HaS tO sToP.

110
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,540
&gt;&gt;Pewds back to normal&lt;&lt; I've never felt so old uh- reviewing these video clips, you understand that right? (Yess Pewds)

111
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,260
I don't take pleasure in this...

112
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,080
It's like watching the fall of- of society.

113
00:03:42,080 --> 00:10:31,560
That's right, society

114
00:10:31,560 --> 00:11:19,000
