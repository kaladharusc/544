decades his signature personality and

14

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,100
1980s since then he's grown to be a very

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,559
well rounded actor and from Batman to

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,809

well-known as his comedic chops age has

19
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,070
not slowed him down either as many

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,809
believe his best work has come in the

21
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,540

comic-book movie icon his skills have

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,159
only gotten better as he's gracefully

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,369
aged and at 67 Keaton has continued to

25
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,500
choose projects that challenge us while

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,420
maintaining his immense pop culture

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,909
status with all these fantastic roles to

28
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,920
choose from it's not easy to just pick a

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
handful but we're here to give you the

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,970
best and that's what you'll get these

31

are the top five best Michael Keaton

32
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,109
performances number five

33
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:29,420
Dogberry and much ado about nothing this

34
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,880
is quite possibly Keaton's best purely

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,189
comedic performance hero the young

36
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,840
daughter of the Machine Ian governor and

39
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,380
wedding an elaborate ruse leads Claudio

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,960
and his prince Don Pedro to believe that

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,200
hero has been unfaithful this was set up

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,060
by Don Pedro's jealous half-brother Don

43
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,329
John confusion hurt feelings and painful

44
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,700
accusations then ensue as you can tell

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,229
from the movie's description Dogberry

46
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,479
isn't a huge character in the story he

47
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,069
serves the narrative as comedic relief

48
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:03,079
in a role that many other actors may

49
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,880
have portrayed his annoying but Keaton

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,889
ends up completely stealing the show

51
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,440
every scene he's in you can't take your

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,330
eyes off of him it's like someone

53
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,800
completely let him off the leash and

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,459
it's the best thing ever remember are

55
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:26,240
you a nurse not really a nurse

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,400
he's insane delusional and hysterical

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,160
all at the same time also always at a

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
ten his energy is through the roof in

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,550
every shot even when he's not talking

60
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,810
Keaton's comedic timing and much ado

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,640
about nothing is nothing short of

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,200
perfect like a most thankful and

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,850
Reverend youth and I praise God for this

64
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,400
for thy pains

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,870
he's so off-the-wall that it makes you

66
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,070
want to see more of him

67
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,560
so you cherish every scene he's in as a

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
gift I wish we could show more clips

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,280
because he's brilliant in all of them

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,980
but here's one more for the road what is

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,650
your name friend

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,810
bacio write down vulture

73
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:23,570
number four Beetlejuice in beetlejuice

74
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,010
Adam and Barbara Maitland have recently

75
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,560
died in a car accident after realizing

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,030
they're dead they are stuck haunting

77
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,709
their home and are not able to leave

78
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,930
soon the Dietz family moves in and

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,540
completely changes the house the only

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,280
one who can see the Maitland's is Lydia

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,730
a strange and unusual teenager

82
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,720
eventually Barbara and Adam get

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,850
desperate and summon Beetlejuice the

84
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,370
dangerous bio-exorcist to scare the

85
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,570
deetzes out of their home

86
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,080
this results in unpredictable and unsafe

87
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,190
situations for both the Maitland's and

88
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,510
the deetzes It's Showtime

89
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,340
this might just be Michael Keaton's most

90
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,530
well-known role like and much ado about

91
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,600
nothing his comedic personality and

92
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
mile-a-minute energy shine through but

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,459
this time the focus is more on him in

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,500
this twisted yet somehow delightful

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,350
early Tim Burton film we even shop in

96
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,590
the same store hey hermano if you're

97
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,419
familiar with Keaton's career at all

98
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,040
you're most likely familiar with

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,660
Beetlejuice it was such a unique

100
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,030
character and performance his quick

101
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,500
thinking and utterly entertaining

102
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,419
one-liners where sometimes improvised

103
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,750
onset ah well I attend to truly I I'm

104
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,979
graduated Harvard Business School I

105
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,690
travel quite extensively I lived through

106
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,950
the Black Plague and I had a pretty good

107
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,639
time during

108
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,340
I've seen yetzer cysts about 167 times

109
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,759
kids get funnier every single time I see

110
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,099
it while Betelgeuse is usually hilarious

111
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,229
there's a darker side to him that Keaton

112
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,900
shows off well he can be pretty creepy

113
00:04:51,900 --> 00:05:05,969
in a depraved kind of way Betelgeuse the

114
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,219
movie balances it's weird yet endearing

115
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:11,400
tone flawlessly something we may have to

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,099
explore much deeper in a future episode

117
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,360
Betelgeuse the character is just about

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,370
as signature performance Michael Keaton

119
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,509
has ever given number three

120
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,150
Ray Kroc in the founder you guys are we

121
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,879
get some McDonald's them yeah no thanks

122
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,279
not a fan of the Golden Arches huh well

123
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,300
this movie won't make you feel any

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,029
better the founder is the true story of

125
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:38,219
Ray Kroc a down-on-his-luck yet

126
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:39,990
determined salesman and how he met the

127
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,419
McDonald brothers in the 1950s the

128
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,370
multi-billion dollar industry that is

129
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,500
today's McDonald's started with crocks

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,969
vision of a national franchise

131
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:50,339
juggernaut that he essentially stole

132
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,860
from the brothers Mac and Dick MacDonald

133
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,750
innovated how fast their kitchen ran

134
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,909
while still producing quality food as

135
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,650
crock went into business with them to

136
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,210
expand the restaurant all over the

137
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,370
country ambition ruthless business

138
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,169
practices and relentless persistence

139
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,599
encompass this American success story

140
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,610
this performance really shows off

141
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,599
Keaton's range

142
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,580
Ray Kroc is portrayed as a fully

143
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,310
realized character from sympathetic and

144
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,830
even likable to completely hated by the

145
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,839
end of the movie the film has a very

146
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,300
unique vibe that blends humor with cruel

147
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,189
business moves and personal corruption

148
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:26,240
in the name of economic growth you know

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,520
contracts are like hearts they're made

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,719
to be program Keaton is amazing in the

151
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:35,430
role as he gets to play a variety of

152
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,710
emotions and motivations at the core of

153
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,779
this character is an unstoppable drive

154
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,849
for success no matter the cost

155
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,949
and that's no more apparent than in this

156
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,279
scene business is war it's dog eat dog

157
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,039
rat eat rat if my competitor were

158
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:50,580
drowning

159
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,159
I walk over and I put a hose right in

160
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,740
his mouth the founder is a great movie

161
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,720
with great performances not just from

162
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,360
Keaton the fact that it's the true story

163
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,770
of the biggest restaurant chain in

164
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,930
American history only adds to its

165
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,789
mystique if you haven't seen the film

166
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,500
consider it in an official top-five

167
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,509
recommendation number two

168
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,150
Batman / Bruce Wayne in Batman and

169
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,719
Batman Returns for many people this is

170
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,759
still the best Batman who has ever

171
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,979
graced the screen this is the part where

172
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,690
I'd break down the movies but I'm pretty

173
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,310
sure this clip will sum it up best for

174
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,159
you I'm Batman

175
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,110
I think he's pretty much equally as good

176
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,759
as the character in both his appearances

177
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,009
well maybe just a bit better in Batman

178
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:42,150
89 stop you all know why this

179
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,529
performance is on here I really

180
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,330
shouldn't have to say much but in short

181
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,340
Keaton's Batman saved the character from

182
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,349
it's campy phase and transitioned him

183
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,090
into the dark Avenger of the night we

184
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,949
all know him as now of course the

185
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,330
character was originally dark and the

186
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,340
comics well before Batman 89 had

187
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,870
returned the Caped Crusader to those

188
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,879
ways but this was the pop culture

189
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,159
phenomenon that cemented the Dark Knight

190
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,229
if for nothing else without Keaton's

191
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,699
Batman we never would have gotten Batman

192
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,409
the Animated Series that's reason enough

193
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,300
to praise his portrayal well I don't

194
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,589
think this version of the character is

195
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,599
perfect it's definitely distinct from

196
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,430
all the others we've seen so far this

197
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,830
Bruce Wayne is very unique he's out

198
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,229
there almost aloof and kind of crazy but

199
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,360
Michael Keaton crazy so it's awesome and

200
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,889
yet the pain of his loss and weight of

201
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,870
his self-imposed responsibilities is

202
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,419
intact here and it showed off in a few

203
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,640
key scenes it's just something I have to

204
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,330
do

205
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:44,279
why because nobody else can look I tried

206
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,250
to avoid all this but I can't this is

207
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,380
how it is I would have loved to have

208
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,640
seen where he could have taken the

209
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,410
character and he proposed to third film

210
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,269
even now I think he could plan Batman

211
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,070
Beyond movie anyone hell he could

212
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,420
probably still pull off being in the

213
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,790
cowl himself he may very well be the

214
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,070
Batman we deserve and the Batman we need

215
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,290
right now having to leave a few these

216
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,209
performances out of the top five was a

217
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,370
very difficult decision but cuts have to

218
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,649
be made somewhere so here are more of

219
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,269
mr. Keaton's best performances as

220
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,430
honorable mentions

221
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:28,730
[Music]

222
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,000
and the number one bet Michael Keaton

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,210
performance is brigand Thompson in

224
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,270
Birdman or the unexpected virtue of

225
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,090
ignorance this was the movie that marked

226
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,530
by some Keaton's comeback two big

227
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,390
starring roles and earned him an Oscar

228
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,460
nomination in the process riggan

229
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,890
Thompson was once a box-office sensation

230
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,290
as the superhero Birdman now years later

231
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,210
he's trying to shed the stigma of being

232
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,460
a washed-up movie star by directing and

233
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,800
starring in a major Broadway production

234
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,540
it's a risky move and with pressure

235
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,640
mounting things are going wrong at every

236
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,830
turn and on top of that an unstable

237
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,570
relationship his ex-wife and daughter

238
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,460
hanging around and a voice in his head

239
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,770
that gets louder with every setback and

240
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,140
you have a man on the verge of a mental

241
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,270
breakdown I almost can't put into words

242
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,210
how absolutely incredible Michael Keaton

243
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,700
is in this movie he was born to play

244
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,740
this character it was faked

245
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,360
the script was not written with him in

246
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
mind but his real life story marrying

247
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,410
Riggins in some ways made for the

248
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,900
perfect backdrop knowing who he is going

249
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,180
in makes the movie and performance even

250
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,730
better movie itself is so interesting

251
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,500
and different and not just because it's

252
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,600
portrayed to be in mostly one continuous

253
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,730
shot I could spend an hour talking about

254
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,830
Birdman and the little intricacies that

255
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,960
make it so good just as I can spend an

256
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,730
hour talking about Keaton's performance

257
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,250
specifically guys if you haven't seen

258
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,900
this movie you need to go out and watch

259
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
it nothing I can say will accurately

260
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,400
describe the experience of seeing it we

261
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,960
watch as Keaton runs through every

262
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,120
emotion in the spectrum we laugh with

263
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,490
him we cry with him we ponder with him

264
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,890
we get frustrated with them it's so raw

265
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,750
and riggan is such a vulnerable

266
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,940
character I have many favorite moments

267
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,340
in the film from funny popularity is

268
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,230
bloody little cousin of Christine

269
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,450
okay I don't know what the fuck nothing

270
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:25,680
so too maddening we're not disappearing

271
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,410
to set - missed a moment really

272
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,260
don't I have a I should we just been

273
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:39,390
there the two of you you know just it's

274
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,730
all there and more Birdman blows

275
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,650
everything else out of the water

276
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,230
Michael Keaton is a powerhouse in this

277
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,910
performance and that's not even the

278
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,310
latest in a string of great films since

279
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,510
he's been back on top

280
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,370
this guy continues to get better into

281
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,070
his late 60s and it was an honor getting

282
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,200
to watch his best performances from past

283
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,840
to present on my personal channel this

284
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,550
week I have a discussion about something

285
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,900
that I've been thinking about for years

286
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,660
we all know Keaton was a great bet but

287
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,940
what his natural personality have been a

288
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,550
better fit for the Joker join me over at
