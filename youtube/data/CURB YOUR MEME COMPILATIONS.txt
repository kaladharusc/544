Curb your meme.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,380
We've all seen the memes with that

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,180
Dun-dun-dun de de de re re 
(same music plays as well)

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,880
But where does it really come from?

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,440
Well.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,580
In case you haven't watched a show Curb Your Enthusiasm,

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,120
then maybe you don't know.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,780
It's one of my favorite TV shows.

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,100
It follows the life of Larry David,

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,440
who created Seinfeld

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,060
and wrote for Seinfeld as well.

12
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,680
So it's the... TV show is very similar to Seinfeld,

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,710
only a little bit more edgier.

14
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,130
They make fun of Swedish people, for example.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,120

(mocking angry voice)

16
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,600
I'm a Jew but not a practicing Jew.

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,920
Oy, Larry with this again.

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
Oy, again, see?

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
-It's an expression.
-[unintelligible] it's an expression.

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
What is this thing?

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,060
A shofar. Why is this on your desk?

22
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,430
People give me gifts. They'll give me like that for my desk or ribbon Mezuzah that's on the door.

23
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,740
Mezuzah that's on the door. What are you by the way? I'm Swedish. I got a Swede lawyer

24
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,740
What are you by the way?

25
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm Swedish.

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,140
I got a sweet lawyer.

27
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,500
She's gonna get everything.

28
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,100
You-You got a good lawyer.

29
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,960
But I have a Swedish lawyer. (chuckles)

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,890
This is a bit unrelated somewhat, but when I got in trouble for making Jew jokes

31
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,470
A lot of people said that oh, it was it was just bad jokes

32
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,500
You know if he had made better jokes about it, then he wouldn't have gotten in trouble

33
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,180
I know people don't actually think that but that's what a lot of people said and I remember seeing not long ago

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,800
Larry got in trouble for making jokes like that as well.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,080
Jews

36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,560
It's a hilarious stand-up bit, but he got in trouble for it cuz

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,160
And he had to apologize.
Very flattering article here by the way

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,720
You know, Larry David, Jewish, and probably the most stereotypical

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,760
Jewish person I've ever seen.

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,420
No, I don't mean to impose but I mean, he literally does that [happy merchant hand rub]

as well unintentionally.

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,770
But in the show Curb Your Enthusiasm, which you have to watch in case you haven't

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,300
It would follow

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,280
Usually three different stories and events that tie together very cleverly.

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,460
Is that a word?

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,280
In the end

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
where you're

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,900
It always ties together to a punchline that always has followed up with a classic theme

00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,760
[Curb Your Enthusiasm theme]

50

Mommy, mommy

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,200
that bald man's in the bathroom

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,600
and there's something hard in his pants.

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,560
OOF

[Curb Your Enthusiasm theme plays]

55
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,060
I remember for some reason, literally at the same time as all the drama between me and the media started

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,460
That's when this meme became popular

57
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,960
I said

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,520
And I never really reviewed my favorite ones.

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,000
So why don't we do that now, together?

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,520
You have you had enough context for this yet?

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,180
Have I explained the jokes

62
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,400
Enough for you?

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
Look, this book is about

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,060
me

65
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,200
sort of noticing that women are always called

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
crazy, psycho, psychopaths, psycho-bitch, you know

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,940
like oh, she's insane.

68
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,720
Well, we write off women as crazy

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,440
O K

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,660
We came out of this show last night

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
girls night in show and everybody was feeling great.

72
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,530
We walk outside and this like, dude walks up,

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,120
He's like &quot;Anybody got a lighter?&quot;

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,620
You're walking into a group of five girls having a lively conversation.

75
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,260
You put yourself in the middle and I walked away I go

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,300
Eww, I'm not doing that and he like started chirping at me.

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,220
What's your problem? Who has a lighter?

78
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,560
and my *fricking* dumb friends like

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,840
I think I do sir, and I'm like this is not the time to

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,600
demonstrate how compassionate you are.

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,340
Don't give them a lighter. Like there's no reason to ple-

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,580
go anywhere else. You're obviously a crazy person.

83
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,720
HAHAHAHAHA

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,480
*Inhales deeply to roast awoman that was very incorrect about her argument and hey by the way, did you consider subscribing to pewds and hitting the bell button and buy his merch cuz ad revenue is low help*

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,360
You're obviously a crazy person.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,440
How dare you. You asked for a lighter.

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,020
I just hate it.

88
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,820
To be honest though,

89
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
I kind of get this girl because I hate being interrupted by strangers,

90
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,920
especially if I'm in the middle of a conversation

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Or trying to tell a joke, even when the waiter comes up

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,790
and I'm in the middle of something.

93
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,880
I'm like, can you see I'm talking. Let me deliver this joke

94
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,620
or let me finish my point

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,580
DEY YAH KEK KOM

96
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,680
Why wont you hear when I was looking at you?

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,460
Why won't you hear what I was staring at you, trying to literally go

98
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,300
Hey, come here!

99
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
Wrong or bad or whatever if there's bad security about

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
Of course, Of course its gonna be a Tana one

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,600
Pewds-&quot;it couldn't be more perfect&quot; Tana-&quot;I've been putting my heart and soul into making it as perfect as you can. Pewds-&quot;Thank God She put her heart and soul into it.

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Theres yet to be an inflluencer really doing like a big American like in California like convention

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,478
with all these big YouTubers?

104

Interviewer-so how come no one has done it

105
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,200
I don't know

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,380
REEEEEEEEEEEEFFFFFFUUUUUNNNNNDDDDDDDD

107
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,780
It's literally the perfect soundtrack.

108
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,980
You couldn't be more perfect for someone messing up.

109
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,940
That's what it is, isn't it? It just hit me.

110
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,780
It's people messing up.

111
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,480
Do you want me to explain the joke further for you? Or maybe then?

112
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,240
*laughing then Large air succ*

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,180
But you've got to be really really careful crossing these

114
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,620
just because you don't know whats solid and what's hollow underneath

115
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,180

Oh wow, that looked really dangerous.

123
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,560
Hehe

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,920
THERE'S NOTHING THERE

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,620
*Pewds silently laughing and losing nothing*

126
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,380
My dream has been to buy a book.

127
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,880
I have been a bookworm since the minute I could read

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,420
It's all I did. All I did was read.

129
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,360
Books are still to me

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,540
so special and so important.

131
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,280
When I was younger, I used to write short stories all the time

132
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,269
All of my friends would be out playing. I would come home and sit on my computer

133
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,720
cause I was writing a book.

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,100
It was just something that I loved to do.

135
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,360
So Penguin contacted me a while back.

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,140
Like hey, have you ever, you know, thought about writing a book?

137
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,240
And I was like

138
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,440
OFCOURSE?

139
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,760
Like, I would absolutely love to write a book.

140
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,680
I would love to have something that I've done myself

141
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,420
that, you know, has come from my brain and got into pages and people can buy it

142
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,420
This is so cringy, I can't.

143
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:18,560
No.

144
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,200
That book sold so well as well.

145
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,420
I remember it was out at the same time as my book and it was still like

146
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,700
Destroying my book, you know

147
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,660
My book, yeah. Okay. Was it the best but at least I wrote it.

148
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,860
Maybe she wanted to you know

149
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,600
It's kind of like the Tanacon. You want something and

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,300
you speak too soon and then you look like an idiot

151
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,060
It's why - it is why I don't tell people anything.

152
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,700
It is why I don't talk to people.

153
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
How are you, guys?

154
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm good. How you doing?

155
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,900
Good. It's so good to see you guys.

156
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,990
Hey, you two

157
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,240
Do you think that all jokes in some way are a copy of

158
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,940
something that someone said before?

159
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,600
No

160
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,640
Blacking out is when you drink so much that your brain goes to sleep

161
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,340
But your body gets all Eye of the Tiger and soldiers on

162
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,420
-You don't? 
-No, no I don't.

163
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,840
When I black out when I drink

164
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,080
is it the worst? No, your mind goes to sleep,

165
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
but your body's like

166
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
TONIGHT IS MY NIGHT

167
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,920
What do you think about this current thing that said that

168
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
you've taken from other peoples jokes?

169
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,220
I would never take anyone's jokes.

170
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,140
I WOULD NEVER *in a louder voice* I WOULD NEVER TAKE ANYONEABDABADA

171
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,920
The thing is like there's so many examples of that.

172
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,140
I remember when I did a video of Amy Schumer

173
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,440
I just think I was just amazed how many there actually were

174
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,140
that she blatantly stole.

175
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,620
Like once, fine, you know.

176
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,840
50

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,080
IIIIIIIII don't know I don't know about dat animaniamammap

178
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,440
They literally should just have the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme

179
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,260
at court

180
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,840
Any time a sentence is delivered, just put theme and you know justice has been served

181
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
It's also scary to know

182
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,460
It's been proven through science that

183
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,320
human activity

184
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,460
That climate change is due to human activity and we

185
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:21,440
continue to ignore it and the only voice that we really have is through voting

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,960
Literally every celebrity ever as a private jet.

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,860
You have Leonardo DiCaprio, an environmentalist

188
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,530
flies in the private air jet

189
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,560
You know, what happens when you live in LA.

190
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,229
Everyone in a constant race to show how humanitarian they are.

191
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,780
I said what are you doing running and you're saying it was really good out

192
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,980
It's the perfect texture for running a very low impact on it's dry snows you're if you don't get wet.

193
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,220
All right, thanks

194
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,220
Perfect texture yeah yeah yeah let's see the perfect texture

195
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,240
OH WOW LOOK AT THE PERFECT TEXTUAAAAAAAAAR

196
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,080
HUEHUEHEUHUE

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,230
Perfectly you weren't sure if this was the right way to go with your character

198
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,880
But the phenomenal response, I guess, tells you that

199
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,540
people really enjoyed it.

200
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:11,060
Give the people what they want... Kill Luke

201
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,740
Did he... Did he just spoil Star Wars before the premiere?

202
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,720
(yes)

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,800
Absolute mad lad.

204
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,469
Let's talk about the matching. Well, okay, so this is for you have sore forearms

205
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,620
I'm assuming from gaming too much

206
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,300
huehuehuehueHUEHEUEHEUHEUEHEUEHEUHEUEHEUEHEUHEUEEUHEUEHEUHEUEHEUEHEUHEUEHEU

207
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,540
LOVE YOU JORDAN!

208
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,060
I love this meme so much

209
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,600
&quot;Each time our next guest pays a visit to our show he risks life and limb&quot;

210
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,140
Specifically my life and my limbs to entertain you. He is a beast master

211
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,040
He's handy with a hammer - he has a new special called

212
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
Pet Nation Renovation premiering Wednesday night on Animal Planet

213
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,280
Please welcome the Canadian Tarzan, Dave Salmoni

214
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,300
Oh my god

215
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,000
O-oh

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
auright, okhey

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,300
*gibberish*

219
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:15,500
*skratta*

220
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,590
That is the most meta thing I've ever seen

221
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,360
You're scared I would never get scared by a video game

222
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,360
cuz I'm a real man. Hey, there we go. Alright. Oh

223
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,880
I would never get scared by a video game.

224
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,660
Congratulations. Woosh the joke just went over your head

225
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,420
