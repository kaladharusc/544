continue to sit on my chair

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,890

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,279
legs thus leading to a heart attack so

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,980

the cunt looking past the weird

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,510
obsession with hipsters I think the main

54
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,880
criticism was that it's not very

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,980
practical you know it's a bit of plastic

56
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,890
that has a conical bottom and it's not

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,050
gonna stand up on its own but let's see

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,780
my favorite ones is not your uncle's

86
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,269
diddle stick it's just like it's it's

87
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,340
edible alcohol so it comes in the form

88
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,650
of like a little pretzel

89
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,510
and you eat it and it gets you real hot

90
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,700
it gives you real drunk obviously the

91
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,610
next part of this project is dealing

92
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,330
with goat horn itself I got the goat mug

93
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,299
sent to me by a viewer in Batman boxing

94
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,650
in fact I was sent a couple of these

95
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,959
with fun did you see that right there

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,900
can you see it funded with Kickstarter

97
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,010
your goat mug is not microwave safe we

98
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,720
want you to drink your coffee fresh

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,669
while it's still warm from brewing that

100
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,699
my friends is how you turn a problem

101
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:31,960
into a selling point

102
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,000
yeah you can't microwave it but you know

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,639
what you can do brew some coffee and

104
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,440
pour it directly in because we want you

105
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,750
to drink it fresh your goat milk

106
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,479
contains a mug made of food grade PP

107
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,590
great I love food grade PP and they give

108
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,930
you a nice little fucking chart there

109
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,320
can you put it in dishwasher no okay but

110
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,370
buddy this one just watch it yes thank

111
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,280
you I need you dad I'd like to put some

112
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,960
meat in here that's the sort of the

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,270
first thing that comes to mind is oh the

114
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,590
leather straps inside

115
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,870
now that is compartmentalization if I've

116
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,789
ever seen it it's impossible to clip

117
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,360
this shit on here okay not not

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,010
impossible that's that's sort of an

119
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,289
oversight is that this shit just time to

120
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,190
go on an adventure

121
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,260
yeah I'm ready it appears to be the same

122
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,450
goat mug like you see right there but

123
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,910
the box is clearly different you know

124
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,639
this one old classic goat story here it

125
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,979
is it almost looks like that was from

126
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,449
the original Kickstarter project but

127
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,510
this is some bullshit this is the goat

128
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,320
horn from something I don't know I don't

129
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,510
know where this was purloined from this

130
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,080
one has a legitimate pleather sort of

131
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,550
covering thing let me let me show you

132
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,880
bitches right I'll put my tea I'll sink

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,139
my teeth into it you'll see although

134
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,060
pleather marks I just sort of winged

135
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,720
this part

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,610
I don't think biting leather actually

137
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,320
tells you whether it's leather or not

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,919
haha this is some weird like rubbery

139
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,380
plastic thing on the top of this one we

140
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,660
have a logo with the goat on the top of

141
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,160
this one we have a logo of the company

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,690
micro eh

143
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,430
there you go go home one

144
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,130
horn - time to go see what these things

145
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,030
are can really do fashion fashion wise

146
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,220
let's see what they can do fashion wise

147
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:27,130
I already feel cool what the fuck

148
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,470
there's a helicopter circling my

149
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,150
building man there's so much more going

150
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,800
on when you film during the day I never

151
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,450
do this this is the first video in like

152
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,640
seven years that I filmed in the

153
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,920
daylight I'm not afraid to admit it I'm

154
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,790
a coffee head and if your coffee head

155
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,070
like me and you love a good cup of joe

156
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,260
one of the most important things in your

157
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,750
arsenal it's the coffee machine this

158
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,850
guy's a little bit tall so we're gonna

159
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,010
have to remove that the bottom section

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:16,560
of this and alright that looks good

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,720
tell me shit happens now instead of

162
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,300
dealing with a hot beverage I decided to

163
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,100
mitigate the risk and we're now we're

164
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,660
gonna use a cold beverage and how do I

165
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,290

antiquated technology you you literally

213
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,040
pour hot water yourself instead of your

214
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,960
machine doing it you literally pour the

215
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,900

227
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
snobs out there don't want to get their

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,450
hands dirty but they don't realize this

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,089
that doesn't work because then that sort

233
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,500
of adds to the flavor you want to take
