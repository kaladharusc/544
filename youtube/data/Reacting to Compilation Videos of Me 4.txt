1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,790
welcome back to the twitch stream uh we

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,680
are not live streaming on Twitch at

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,080
least I hope we're not ok we're not like

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,760
I said last week this week we are

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,340
actually in Hong Kong we are pre

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,779
recording this before we leave I hope

7
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:19,250
that you can understand sometimes when

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,020
we travel it is kind of difficult to

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,970
like make the best videos you've ever

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,980
seen because our workload is essentially

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,439
double so for those of you that like

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,330
these videos I hope that you have a good

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,760
time and if this is an ear style I will

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,140
see you next week when we get back from

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,850
Hong Kong I'm excited because I know

16
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,399
that there are a couple videos of me as

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,510
a chair as horror films which I have I

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,280
also genuinely really like making videos

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,840
like these because it gives me a chance

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,420
to sit back and enjoy the content you

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,219
know what we like content to like

22
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,500
content just as much as y'all first we

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,329
got to start streaming on Twitch on

24
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,570
accident don't do that

25
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,680
Julian's best background comments will

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,800
do yes so when we film and edit videos

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,659
it's all like in one day like I have

28
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,520
never changed that really it's with the

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,250
exception right now I genuinely forget

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,170
some of the stuff that happens in the

31
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,659
videos right now it's probably the first

32
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,700
time that I've watched this back since I

33
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,009
posted this I'm not sitting and watching

34
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,619
it a couple months out like I forgot

35
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,600
that you made that a bunch of speed of

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,479
me when I'm doing a video where I'm

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,009
concentrating on something that I'm

38
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,170
really trying to pull off I don't hear

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,270
your jokes like I don't hear them and

40
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,509
you're like they're that far of the zone

41
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,740
like what I'm editing I'm like oh my god

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,320
like literally did not even experience

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,420
Julian's saying that in person get you a

44
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,560
girl who filters you out is that the

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
first time that you started making that

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,090
joke just fuck me up honestly just like

47
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,100
just like you explained when I start

48
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,840
talking I don't

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,210
where I've where I've started where I've

50
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,950
gone marble is not knowing where he is

51
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,720
for one minute straight you mean every

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,180
day oh he's so cute

53
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,280
fun fact this video got D monetized yeah

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
I don't know why like cool what the hell

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,209
cool he fucking melts your heart I know

56
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,000
he like really gets me he doesn't use

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,239
happening you're seeing the snippet of

58
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,940
video where he he's come to terms of the

59
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,560
fact that he's lost in the world but he

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,970
sees your face so it doesn't even matter

61
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,130
to him the prior 30 seconds of video

62
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,930
it's him like searching around and he

63
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,980
doesn't know where he is but then he

64
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,540
sees your face and it's like it's wrong

65
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,000
everything's ok it's because my face is

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,349
this home I think you're gonna say your

67
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,880
face is a drug because I was gonna say

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,690
I'm addicted to that oh alright

69
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,459
I've seen one of these I think there's a

70
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,810
few though alright I'm ready

71
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,250
because people were tweeting them at me

72
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:10,250
non-stop oh my god a weed oh my god dude

73
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,010
okay with scary music this is actually

74
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,090
it's so fucking horrifying

75
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,910
[Laughter]

76
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,230
[Music]

77
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:27,420
[Laughter]

79
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,240
Hannah Smith well if someone who hadn't

80
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,790
seen your video came across this they

81
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,709
genuinely like freak the fuck out it

82
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,990
really was like very disturbing looking

83
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,120
like once I got up when she got up you

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,160
looked you looked very disturbing you

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,390
look like you had just gotten out of a

86
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,830
bunch of like a bunch of years of lab

87
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,390
testing that you didn't sign up for

88
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,530
that's not nice

89
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,540

I'm calling you I want to see the other

93
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,239
one how they compare it's amazing to me

94
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,550
that two separate people look it they

95
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,920
were uploaded the same day so the first

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,709
is Harvey reaons version but they both

97
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,340
had the idea to make a horror at it oh

98
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:20,310
it just came to them Oh

99
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,340

it's gonna trigger me cuz when I tell

112
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,660

it's like I've had it already like I've

122
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,180
passed several stages of you just don't

123
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,500

124
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,849
of just like let me go a little more

125

like see what I'm up to during some of

126
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,660
those clips I was like in physical pain

127
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,580
or something frustrating and you're just

128

131
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,820
okay I don't appreciate I thought this

132
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,610
was gonna be complimentary what is this

133
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,590
why did you just zoom in on poor

134
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,420
Kermit's little weenus he's

135
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:47,160
self-conscious about it that's what you

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,330
hear in the middle of the night that

137
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,240
wakes you up like every night like he'll

138
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,040
be like get him off you cuz he's I'll

139

142
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,680
this channel I like their style of

143
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,210
editing when Kermit eats because it's

144
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,950
just it's so accurate to like what it's

145
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,300
like that when you're there it really is

146
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,670
[Laughter]

147
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:23,510
[Music]

148
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,100
these people make me feel like I'm bad

149
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,440
at editing honestly I agree I agree when

150
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,360
I see like a really well-done meme video

151

I'm like fuck like what about yeah I

152

159
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,090
really hungry after watching that clip

160
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,260
that's disgusting

161
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,590
Oh why would someone think that you

162
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,380
burping the ABCs azar funniest moments

163
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,390
that is disgusting because they have

164
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,420
sense of humor

165
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:39,710

170
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,460
