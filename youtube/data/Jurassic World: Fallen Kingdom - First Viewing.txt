1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:11,429
all right this is our second viewing of

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,830
Jurassic Park falling Kingdom I am

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,190
excited I'm very excited because this

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,820
was he's so bad it's good film to me I

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,519
thought this was a lot of fun for how

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,160
terrible batshit insane it was that was

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
more Jurassic world for me this this was

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,130
so busy this was a trainer this was just

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,950
so it got dumber and dumber and dumber

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,020
and then just layer things that are

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,180
grounding idiocy at the end is just

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,340
amazing it just failed on every level

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,010
it's such a spectacular degree who not

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,629
like there's just too many things that

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,940
just annoy me like I hate the characters

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,469
to a degree then like I can't even get

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,820
fun out of it cuz I just wish their

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,590
heads would explode they're just like

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,739
it's like twister if like hipsters we're

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,329
all the characters of geeks if they're

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,550
all hipster who knows maybe you'll be

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,489
better the second time maybe we'll just

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,100
see a whole new avenue of amazingness

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,930
that we just completely missed

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,150
to quote Luke Skywalker and Robot

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,049
Chicken that's highly unlikely let's

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,600
check it out this is Jurassic world

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,880
falling Kingdom the fact that it says

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,650
Amblin just annoys me all the more cuz I

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,939
mean the Spielberg helped produce this

31
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,710
piece of shit yeah he also produced a

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,080
lot of transformer movies yes he did

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,829
cast Shia LeBouf as Williams all right

34
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,680
so he's losin it we really don't care

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,240
where these take place anymore but

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,299

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,110
sub yeah a landmark technological power

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,060
and we've consistently proven ourselves

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,370
incapable of handling that power he's

47
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,190
talking about the filmmakers yeah I mean

because she's not a bad actress it's

110
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,930
just such an awfully written character

111
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,970
like was anybody on this kids side at

112
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,590

113
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,660
someone like everybody said like that

114
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,720
girl need to go jail yeah why couldn't

115

you just take your right-wing military

116
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,380
asshole trope here shoot these dinosaurs

117
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,270
and get a DNA sample and then go back

118
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,010
and not have to bring the dinosaurs with

119
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,960
you I know they want to auction them but

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,610
just wreck them again and then auction

121
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,910
em Rob Rob they only have enough money

122
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,970
to make a gigantic auctioning torture

123
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,950
chamber under the guise plays without

124

him knowing and totally soundproof and

125
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,479
nobody can find it they don't have the

126
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,120
money to make other dinosaurs back dr.

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,010

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,110
doctors never worked on a dinosaur

137
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,100
really Dallas Brice Howard Houston

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,110
Austin Texas whatever you could have

139
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,570
picked somebody in dr. Wu's torture camp

140
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,700
who had formerly worked at the park just

141

movie we're nerds saved the day but in

149
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,030
the end I think nerds destroyed the

150
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:36,580
world so I don't know well maybe thought

151
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,500

153

mistake

154
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,230
I like how Raptor training is basically

155
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,300
like George Costanza trying to stop a

156
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,800
truck from running over his fogger

157
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,400
machine you would think a dinosaur would

158
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,500
be smart enough to look at lava and go

159
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,480

164
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,170

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,870

179
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,240
scene and it doesn't involve dinosaurs

180
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,280

I'm sorry I blew more holes in this

185
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,870

196
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,920
I'll tell you though this is the best

197
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,140
metaphor for the movie because that's

198
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,760
the franchise yeah they're a

199
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,250
brontosaurus crying out in anguish as

200
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,190
its engulfed in flames and an audience

201
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,850
watches really sad probably depressed

202
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,920
and empty inseparably drawn to war and

203
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,760
is willing to use any means necessary

204
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,610
commentary commentary allegory allegory

205
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,350
humans suck what if he doesn't find a

206
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,380
vein oh we got a whisper cuz none of

207
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:25,310
those other dinosaurs are making noises

208
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,710
and when your movie sucks this hard and

209
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,470
then tries to make a political statement

210
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,570
right your side look yeah no no it

211
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,790

212
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,500
would never vote for Trump but I would

213
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,150
tell every single one of these

214
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,100
characters I did just to piss them off

215
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,470
not a likeable character this whole

216
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:43,920
movie

217
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,899

things have gotten it's the only likable

219
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,579
character do you really think you could

220
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:51,630
get away with it

221
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,540
in my own house where I come to play

222

they're outside right now you never

226
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:11,430
thought about the applications of your

227
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,410
research or oh I totally did I just

228

233
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,139

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,940
grandmothers something like that you

239

would you like that fucking dog just

285
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,850
because multiple dinosaurs have tried to

286
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,560
eat her that doesn't mean that they

287
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,190
don't deserve a little TLC - okay the

288
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,930
movie still was sucked hard but would

289
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,870
you give a little bit of credit if they

290
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,140
went that ballsy it just killed them all

291
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,480
you know hell yeah and no way to stop

292
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,460
the gate from opening once it said

293
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,800
something like my garage door opener if

294
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,700
you tap it twice

295
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,650
it starts closing and they can't figure

296
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,270
out I'd do that with a fucking gate and

297
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,400
nobody stops her like literally just

298
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,950
just fucking tackles her and then starts

299
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,090
hitting all the other buttons to try to

300
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,250
close it they just sit there and watch

301
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,040

302
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,230

Jurassic world

310
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,190
so finally we actually get a drastic

311
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,670
world at the end of the second of the

312
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,190
fifth Jurassic Park movie the second one

313
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,380
called Jurassic world this should be

314
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,990
where this fucking movie started started

315
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,180
World II feel like it was so splay like

316
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,980
people you loved it or hated it like

317
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,720
with this way it's like people you hate

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,940
it or they're like great yes I get it a

319
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,160
little bit because I did like Jurassic

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,200
world but I thought that was better

321
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,390
trash than I do like people like

322
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,040
Jurassic world I didn't like it but I

323
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,670
understood why

324
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,830
this one I can't get cuz it's so dull

325
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,660
and boring and swim there's nothing in

326
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:56,660
the other one happening make no sense

327
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,240
