1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
yeah

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,090
I

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:11,460
the loudest ice cream truck over her behind

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,460
I don't know

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:28,960
not gonna believe this is on my run this morning and I dropped my iphone into the

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
East River like drop it straight into the river

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,030
I was setting it up to like shoot this amazing time

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,030

9
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:51,940
for this story

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,769

11
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:01,390
great run beautiful day listening to great music phone in hand just just

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,979
having a great sunday morning New York City run

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:21,640
I see what is the potential for a triple a mind-blowing perfect 100 out of 100

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
time lapse

15
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:33,670
so I person just beneath the railing right here on the edge perfectly

16
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,380
amazingly frame just like virtuoso cinematography

17
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,380
I hit record

18
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:51,620
this mighty gust of wind as if God Himself sneeze and blew my phone and i

19
00:01:51,620 --> 00:02:03,530
watched it tumble in slow motion and I knew at that moment there was nothing I

20
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,530
could do to get that phone back

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,040
add a that I dropped my cell phone in to these river

22
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:21,219
