00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,420
testing testing 1 2 3 this is a

3
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,710
comprehensive test testing testing look

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,200
at me you know I made a little change in

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,030
here because after reading on you guys

6
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,590
on it I realized that the sound wasn't

7
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,629
very good in the room this sounds

8
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,940
probably still bad and the lighting is

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,220
probably still better however I did make

10
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,780
some changes the lighting should be

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,850
marginally better the problem is there's

12
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,100
little pockets there's only shadow

13
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,050
pockets as I like to call them you'll

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,990
want to maybe this area or a walk right

15
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,430
here and all the sudden there's like

16
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,860
some shadow here and this is fucking

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,660
it's not coming from there so it's kind

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,910
of shitty but it's difficult to fix okay

19
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,759
I'm with just one guy one thing you may

20
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,009
have also noticed is that the lens is

21
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,080
different it's sort of wide-angle it

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
might make us look like we're in a Guy

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,520
Ritchie movie and I'm about to fucking

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,040
snort some coke on a table but that's

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,500
not the case anyway let's go on over

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,080

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,920
that pretty much counts I'm not sure

80
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,600
what the score is yet I think I probably

81
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,120
was that five probably a couple misses

82
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,870

to meet the steel balls these targets

87
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:38,830
