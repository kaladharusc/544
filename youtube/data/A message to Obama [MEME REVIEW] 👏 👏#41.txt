00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,940
Don't you dare say it

164
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,140
Don't you- *laugh track*

165
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,600
[reading text]

166
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,300
it's okay

167
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
I mean no

168
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,960
[reading text]

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,020
it's so bad

170
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,000
&quot;weird flex but okay&quot; aw, who would have though that would have happened

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,420
someone took the literal context of the meme. Never done-heard-seen that one before

172
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,640
[reading the text]

173
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,480
The woke level of the meme!

174
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,385
[you guessed it, reading the text]

175
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:23,200
it's not a weird flex and it's not okay!

176
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,340
Am I the first one to say this? It's not okay

177
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,880
Stop flexing and stop okaying

178
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,820
I'm sick of it

179
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,300
[reading text]

180
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,080
This is not a weird flex, but okay. Shut the hell up

181
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,620
Learn how to meme like a real memester and stop it

182
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,480
You're not funny, you're pathetic

183
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,840
kids are literally posting anything, every time I tweet these days &quot;weird flex but okay&quot;

184
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,180
just shut the hell up

185
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,420
&quot;weird flex but okay&quot;

186
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,760
and while we're talking about this image, okay

187
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,960
someone pointed out that I walk like a virgin, which I don't okay

188
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,300
I walk like an absolute chad

189
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,480
You look at this, we're gonna go through the whole thing alright?

190
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
Back slouched

191
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,100
Maybe a little bit, okay alright fine

192
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,200
hair seems to overreact to wind

193
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,260
do you see that pristine hair? This hair cut doesn't move for anything, alright?

194
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,400
so 1:1

195
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,020
Head craned forward

196
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,900
Well obviously because i'm- well whatever!

197
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,340
Just shut the hell up!

198
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm not a virgin!

199
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,460
This stupid meme *clap* *clap* gets zero, okay?

200
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,600
stop weird flexing, everyone stop

201
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,400
If I see a single goddamn comment talking about &quot;weird flexing but okay&quot;

202
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,220
alright, i'll kill you. That's right

203
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,020
This is a threat, what are you gonna do shut this video down for online harassment? Like I care

204
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,820

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Calling Sive

211
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:02,700
Do we have time for Bonus Meme?

212
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,380
I regret to inform you all that we did not have time for Bonus Meme.

213
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,060
Also screw the Bruh meme do you know how hard it was to caption that

214
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,400
also PSA for anyone else that does captions, don't fill them with bullshit. Don't make it a comment section

215
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,580
people actually use these to read and understand. Thanks.

216
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:23,000
