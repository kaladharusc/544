1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,429

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,140
YouTube boogie2988 come at you live

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,460
let's get through the power of the

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,420
internet and it's that time of month

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,630
again it's lootcrate time except this

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,469
one's a little different huh

7
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:14,700
so normally whenever I do my Luke read

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,830
unboxings I do the basic crate I do the

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,570
DX crate and sometimes I show off an

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,189
alternative crate I have you guys know

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,720
they have a ton of different crazy they

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,250
just shipped out like a destiny to one

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,810
that you can't get anymore there's like

14
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,789

15
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,410

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,179
South Park some of the best collectibles

17
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,289
I have in the background actually came

18
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,120
from some of these specialty crates and

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
this is one of those specialty offshoot

20
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,200
crates this is the Marvel gear and goods

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,290
one this is my regular crate my DX crate

22
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,579
are not here but I wanted to shoot a

23
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,719
video today I figured I would do this

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,309
one but we're at a really good place in

25
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,420
Marvel right now because we're coming

26
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,070

ant-man and and wasp I I'm excited right

29
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,770
now just to see what's in this crate I

30
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,539
got a feeling it's a Deadpool oriented

31
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,980
crate I really hope it's Deadpool cuz

32
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,449
I've got some great Deadpool merch and I

33
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,969

53
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,700

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040

57
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,079
nothing Deadpool in here I guess the

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,189
other two crates last month were

59
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,409
Deadpool this is gonna be all infinity

60
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,280
war and huh okay yeah you got me with

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,140
this one this is really cool

62
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,659
this is ceramic mug designed to look

63
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,829
like the Infinity Gauntlet

64
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,550
wow this mug is huge and it looks really

65
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,069
really good I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

66
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,050
hold on let's see if I can do this

67
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,360
Oh oh that is cool and now I'll get to

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
make one wish because these are

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,050
basically dragon balls I'm just gonna

70
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,650
wish for more resources though because

71
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,720
yeah that makes way more sense we always

72
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,040
have a lot of these but you have a lot

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,150
of big parties so this is gonna be kind

74
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,730
of nice this is a stacking coaster set

75
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,590
oh that's actually kind of cool okay

76
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,270
let's get these out of the box

77
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,010
so they're basically made a glass and

78
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,960
see-through and they're stacked up in

79
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,010
your table they're gonna look like this

80
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,590
but then when you remove them you know

81
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,030
they make a little tableau all stacked

82
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,830
up but as you remove them they're gonna

83
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,510
have individual scenes on them so

84
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,580
they're gonna look way better stacked up

85
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,440
I fail I feel like that was just boring

86
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,810
that just looks bad that one looks great

87
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,730
though I don't know these are these are

88
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,190
okay I don't necessarily like glass

89
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,490
coasters but stacked up they look pretty

90
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,620
good though and then finally I do not

91
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,970
have the patience to ever put this

92
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,990
together so I'm not gonna put this

93
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,190
together I will give this to a friend to

94
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,650
put together but it is a civil war

95
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,960
Captain America 3d wood model and

96
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,970
basically it's just made like a balsa

97
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,670
wood and it's it's pre-cut perforated so

98
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,050
you can pop it out and you'll make a

99
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,030
Captain America shield probably about

100
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,730
the size of this kind of cool I just

101
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,200
don't have the patience to do these I

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,320
mess them up every time I try but flint

103
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,670
this one's for you buddy and then

104
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,100
finally here's this must pen clearly a

105
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,350
black panther pen it says today we don't

106
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,200
fight for one life we fight for all of

107
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,820
them that's pretty cool you know at

108
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,170
VidCon this year I saw a lot of people

109
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,970
with a lot of loot crate pins on their

110
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,100
lanyard I gotta look really really cool

111
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,570
I should probably do that and then

112
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,310
here's a little little piece of art for

113
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,100
you on the back side we have everything

114
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,080
that you got in the crate and the best

115
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,470
part about this no mega crate so I can't

116
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,090
get screwed out of it and that's the

117
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,709
Marvel gear and goods crate and I gotta

118
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,360
say what a high quality crate this

119
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,980
turned out to be most of the times

120
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,360
especially crates have a much higher

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,489
quality of merchandise in them and this

122
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,200
is definitely those cases with a basic

123
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,940
rate you always at least get a t-shirt

124
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,560
for your 20 bucks and some other stuff

125
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,320
too but it's only in this crate this is

126
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,280
kind of the crate that you get stuff

127
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,380
like this this is empty I don't know why

128
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,970
I'm trying to pretend otherwise if you

129
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,080
enjoyed this unboxing don't forget

130
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,040

131
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,419
