for Dan told me something while we were

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,790
recording those time lapses and that's

57
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,310
that he's been talking to himself alone

58
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,159
is it okay is that - was that personal

59
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,290
it's fine dude I've been I've been so

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,060
lonely that I've been speaking to myself

61
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,599
in my room and then I would say I feel

62
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,280
guilty I know I'm the only person Dan

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,659
knows but I don't hang out with my

67
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,569
saying like I'm cool in this part of my

68
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,480
life - to not be socializing all the

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,730
