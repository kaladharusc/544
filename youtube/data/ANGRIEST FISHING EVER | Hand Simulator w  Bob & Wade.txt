1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,109

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,869
FIFO hello all right so what do we do

7
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,269
what are we doing here so first we have

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,730
to press this red button and then okay

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,550
it starts the map so now we have to open

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,649
this box get it grenade out and throw it

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,550
at each other all right easy no where

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,940
you going where why dad that way no

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,219
shouting about your own failures is

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,110
maybe entertaining for some people but

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,800
for professional gamers like me we don't

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,020
care what are you talking about that's

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,170
all you've done for six years

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,110
shot about my successes and my successes

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,110
are that I'm gonna blow your ass away I

20
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,250
having never played this game before I

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,890
feel like I'm at a distinct disadvantage

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,189
don't worry

23
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,790
oh you can left-click there goes my

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,430

maybe it's a multistream maybe somebody

93
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,650
maybe maybe watching the multi stream is

94
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,270
causing the soprano turn off the multi

95
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,889
stream won't go back into the game it's

96

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,220
on me and I take full responsibility for

361
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,770
that but listen when I showed that name

362
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,660

363
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,090
trust my fan base turns out my fan base

364
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,530

365
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,150
alright so let's try not showing the

366
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,010
secret game wait is there a new name yes

367
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,000
would you like me to say it out loud for

368
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,640
you yes no wait I think we need to

369
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,760
restart for marks frames mark's fishing

370
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,580
pole is coming through the boat maybe

371
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,840
yours is

372
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,030
I guess you want to restart for the

373
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,610
Froyo yeah for his frames restart for

374
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,340
his frames

375
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,880
restart from that didn't count as me

376
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,680
calling for a restart for my frames I

377
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,150
was like mark can't call front of the

378
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,250
restart no no no no no no no Bob called

379
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,410
the restart in and his frames very bad I

380
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,210
know I wasn't gonna restart for Bob yet

381
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,980
but you said I needed to restart no no

382
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,080
no no no I didn't I I didn't say that

383
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,440
you you you're liar by the liars the

384
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,230
host because I think mark are to use the

385
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,200
purity to restart for my fragrance

386
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
that's his friends that's his prey now

387
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,410
both restarts are done he called for his

388
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,970
frames and he called for my friends I

389
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,010
can still call for your frames Bob

390
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,280
streams and my own frame still I need to

391
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,580
restart for my frames god dammit

392
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,080

393
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,820
