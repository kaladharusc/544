110
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,930
the conclusion on the comprehensive

111
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,330
review ah well the concept the concept I

112
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,880
give an A+ to ran out of the bag a plus

113
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,099
I want this in every Airport I go to the

114
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,380
execution well it sort of feels like a

115
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,700
rough draft they have a little bit of

116
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,050
ways to go before this becomes like a

117
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,300
practical and safe means of getting

118
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,130
around Airport but overall I think it's

119
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,820
a pretty great little idea all right so

120
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,470
that's kind of probably it for the

121
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,020
episode today we're both pretty beat up

122
