1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,680

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,470

5

yeah

6
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,330

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,040
yeah

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,180
you like these ones yeah

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,620
what you hesitated these ones some trunks

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,660
what about these ones with the elastic ways and I thought my short time here

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,700
KITT super high

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,700
so somebody's hands in shorts

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,370
to get it

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,560
much much much much much better today is Monday but also the line for that after

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,890
a holiday here in the states what else we didn't end nothing right

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,380
walking around

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,780
in order to walk around in circles are you gonna get a boozy drink this Italian

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,909
family just came over and said hi

20
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,390
took selfies with me it turns out these are the people that own

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,189
manfrotto tripod look is great to meet you guys

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,560
thank you I'll see you in Italy ok bye guys

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,759
that's the manfrotto family it could mean like do you use them and photo

24
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,759
thrive on

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,520
do

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,390
taking advantage of an afternoon nap time

27
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,479
going to the office

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,480
broken camera audio and conditions

29
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:29,079
while I'm in here i thought i would take a second to talk about camera equipment

30
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:33,069
namely this thing here this flexible tripod day

31
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,719
it's sort of my mainstay it's my go-to it's not raped

32
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,349
this is a really good compact tripod and when you set it up to look something

33
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,430
like this

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,480
this is a really good camera mount you can put the camera on their clip it onto

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,389
anything that this is a really good selfie stick

36
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,450
put your camera on the end great for taking pictures or video of yourself

37
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:56,379
this is a really good camera mount you put it there makes it easy to hold the

38
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,310
camera steady

39
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,109
all this stuff's amazing but the problem is this stuff takes up a lot of space

40
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:06,549
this thing does everything these do just not very well

41
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,219
and the reason why I bring this up today is because in every at least once a week

42
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:17,829
this camp hey watch my camera falls over people in the comments give me a really

43
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,280
hard time for it like I'm doing it on purpose which is an outrageous thing to

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,909
suggest that's how that's how my camera falls over

45
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:28,479
I think I'm setting this thing up securely it feel secure

46
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,709
is it secure yes it's secure and then I walk away from the camera to turn around

47
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,569
to talk to camera or whatever

48
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:37,900
by the time I turn around the camera have fallen over

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,620
of course if you are using a proper tripod that wouldn't happen

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,879
a proper amount like this that would never happen but usually this is all I

51
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,449
have

52
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,079
in an average video like yesterday i set my camera exactly

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:04:02,690
so the chances that it's gonna tip over one of those times is pretty good so

54
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,780
it's less of a matter of carelessness and more just like this is super

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,300
versatile small light easy to use but it like does have a tendency to tip over

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,440
if you don't really take your time to set it up I hope you now understand why

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,760
the camera falls over

58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,070
so often it I didn't do that on purpose

59
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,400
yeah

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,560
so i have to replace this camera with one of my problems here

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,650
most of these cameras are also broken in one way or another

62
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:45,070
like this camera for example this is my old 70d great camera but i also broke

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,150
the microphone thing there so it has to stay in the studio and be treated like

64
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,639
really carefully otherwise it gets all walkie is one of my 80 DS great camera

65
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,710
but this one broken LCD so this doesn't turn on at all

66
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,729
this one took a fall I think this happened I think this happened when I

67
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,199
fell off my skateboard but the students to work

68
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,100
you

69
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,740
all right back in action

70
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:43,179
that's backward well all the luck

71
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,990
yeah

72
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,170
I don't know much but I do know that boosted boards are not meant for skate

73
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,920
park

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,950
hi

75
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,140
yeah I don't steal this from you nice to meet you nice to meet you left by those

76
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,290
were just some kids at the skatepark wonderful out the boosted board my

77
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,660
chinese jets years

78
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,660
I got to get one

79
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,860
my

80
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:28,029
yeah well the quiz it

81
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,649
weekend trip to the grocery store friend scene is in a mood of all mood today

82
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,969
yeah

83
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
we're gonna get some pizzas and some empanadas then get out of here

84
00:06:49,540 --> 00:07:04,120
I can hear the fireworks for on house but I couldn't see them from going out

85
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,770
to find you

86
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,750
Wow

87
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,550
so the I think these are the Liberty Island fireworks these are shot from New

88
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,780
Jersey the new york city fireworks show is on the other side of the island and

89
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,190
the East River and that starts at like that starts in like 15 minutes

90
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,830
I don't know that i'm going to go over there see it's pretty crazy over the

91
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,100
head over the side right now to see what's going on

92
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:43,509
all right the police just told me it's too close to firework time and they're

93
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,969
not letting anyone else on the FDR like where you watch the fireworks but I got

94
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,529
the boost bored i'm going to try to sneak around

95
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,969
well maybe I can get through here vauxhall parts all over there

96
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,400
I think this cop back there knew me they gave me the VIP treatment

97
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:15,260
let me get my skateboard just use all right brief update i was stuck in a jam

98
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,040
back there and then they open the floodgates and now all the people are

99
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,790
going up to now all the people going up the FBR Casey what's also cool one

100
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,050

I think you're too beautiful

102

my master what's up guys ok the firework barge is right there

103
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,550
this is the prime vantage point but I don't know how to get out of here after

104
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,019
the fireworks are over

105
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,010
this is the spot up they have all the people who are proud of this one narrow

106
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,360
throat they're here after the fireworks are going to open this up for getting

107
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,220
out of here

108
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,600
this guy's in charge is super cool they're starting

109
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,089
but you can see our building

110
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,830
top

111
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,019
does it look cool I just come home

112
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,519
pretty full fireworks

113
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:20,119
it's starting to rain out I'm gonna

114
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,920
I was just about to walk out the door

115
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,519
somebody left me this bag of candy and it's called shrimp and bananas

116
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,660
I don't know that I could think of a more disgusting combination been

117
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,899
tripping and the kind of bread

118
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,920
they don't taste like shrimp or bananas
