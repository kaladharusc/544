Casey nice at guide to filmmaking so for all of you out there who can't afford

12
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,909
tuition to NYU or other expensive film schools

13
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:08,799
just watch this video over and over over I promise you'll be all right let's

14
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:17,049
begin first let's talk about gear here doesn't matter

15
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:21,759
let me explain well before i get into that let me just first defend myself

16
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,090
because right now there's a bunch of people writing comments below there like

17
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,479
easy for you to say you have all these expensive cameras

18
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,880
that's very true i do but i didn't always my HBO show which is one of the

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,069
successes in like mainstream movie career was shot on this camera

20
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:43,450
this is even high death this is shooting on tape this is the video camera your

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,459
parents used to film you on for like 3rd birthday and some of our biggest videos

22
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,459
like bike lanes

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,159
bike lanes was shot on this little camera this thing is called this is a

24
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,090
cannon 300 HS you can buy these used on amazon for like 90 bucks if all it took

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,000
to be good was to have the right equipment

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,479
the people who had the most money would always win this that will be called pan

27
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,739
it premiered this weekend now if all it took to make good stuff was to have the

28
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,790
right equipment

29
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,390
trust me whoever made that movie with a hundred and fifty five million dollar

30
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,860
budget had way better cameras and you could ever afford this is all in canada

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,730
i'm just going to the steps and i'm loving the new blog

32
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,769
what I was like 20 years old 21 years old i was invited to the New York Film

33
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,390
Festival and I saw this movie here at the New York Film Festival huge huge

34
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,840
huge theater sold out standing ovation

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,160
this is a movie called tarnation it's pretty youtube it's like blogging before

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,580
logging was even a consideration this movie

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,260
it won best documentary at the National Society of Film Critics the Independent

38
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,480
Spirit Awards the Gotham awards LA and London Film Festival's it grossed over a

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,950
million dollars in the box office and it cost two hundred and eighteen dollars

40
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,049
and thirty-two cents to make and it was edited using iMovie software that's free

41
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,579
editing software

42
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,820
the gear didn't matter for him and he made like one of the most celebrated

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,720
documentaries of that entire year and that's what I want to talk about now I

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,549
want to talk about story tub

45
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,510
ok before i get into that here is a quick review of all of my favorite video

46
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,800
cameras

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,770
this is sean my three-year-old galaxy s three XY

48
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,700
if you have money for a camera just use your cell phone cell phones are great

49
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,090
this is my iphone if you only have like a hundred bucks a highly recommend

50
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,930
getting whatever the cheapest point shoot is from walmart this thing

51
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,680
six years old and he was like a hundred fifty bucks and I first got it totally

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,200
adequate if your budget is closer to 300 bucks i recommend the canon s120 that's

53
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,250
what this is

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,280
it's a really solid cameras to shoot everything on this

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,460
now a lot of people say but if I had three hundred bucks why wouldn't I just

56
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,040
gotta go problem gopros are incredible

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,340
borderline miraculous little devices but if you want to make videos

58
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,210
you're better off with a point and shoot like this or one like this these are

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,030
just more dynamic you can do more with something like this

60
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,160
I absolutely love GoPros but it's really hard to watch like long videos

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,550
especially ones that are action videos that are shot and go pros

62
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,730
if you want the very best . shooter on the market

63
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,940
get the sony rx100 mark for pretty amazing camera except for the price it's

64
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,200
like 900 bucks

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,169
you're gonna spend nine hundred bucks you'd be much better off with one of

66
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,700
these this is a cannon

67
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,900
t-6s which is like the cheapest SLR you can buy it has autofocus

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,720
now you're looking at my main shooter this is a canon 70d with a wider ones on

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,140
there

70
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,850
this cameras I 1,300 bucks that lens another 500 the microphones another 200

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,340
all in this is like a two-thousand-dollar set up that you're

72
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,650
looking at to get this picture and this sound

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,660
but if you want to upgrade this image is from my canon 5d mark III with an l

74
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,250
series lens on there

75
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,490
so this is like a five or six thousand dollar camera the difference between

76
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,140
this and a 2000 our cameras like this the difference - 2000 our camera and 600

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,140
our cameras like this

78
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,419
this thing's ok it's about a hundred bucks now he spent two dollars more you

79
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,560
get one of these

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,510
the quality goes way up and the price only goes up a little bit

81
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,040
now if you spend three dollars more than that you get one of these for 600 bucks

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,370
the quality goes way over here

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,610
but the price hasn't moved much now if you go from 600 to 6,000 the price goes

84
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,610
way up and the quality only moves a little bit as you spend more you get

85
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,610
less and less for your return

86
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,610
story story is all that matters

87
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,910
story is golden story since the top of that gigantic pyramid that is filmmaking

88
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,910
they do another diagram

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,780
the story is king everything serves the king

90
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,560
all of this is just here to serve the story

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,760
defining what a story is is really really hard to do not sure there's

92
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,449
actually a generic formula to telling stories

93
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,650
you have to find something that an audience is interested in and then share

94
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,389
with them in a way that they're also interested in the only way to learn

95
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,500
these things and get better at these things is by doing it over and over and

96
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,100
over

97
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,639
we have all these tools that enable us to create in ways that are more

98
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,070
accessible that are cheaper that are more fair

99
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,699
that's what excites me the most I hope that was helpful for you if you're an

100
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,610
