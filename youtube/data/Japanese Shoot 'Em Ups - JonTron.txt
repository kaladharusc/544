1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:36,380
jontron

2
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,870
the Japanese make some crazy yeah

3
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,280
but what can you expect they've lived

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,900
isolated on an island for like what

5
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,940
thousands of years your brains bound to

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,070
make up some weird stuff as one time I

7
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,170
saw Tom Hanks was living on an island he

8
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,190
became best friends with a ball a ball

9
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,600
and he was only there for like a couple

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,430
of years can you imagine how many

11
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,050
tentacles this ball with a head coming

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,160
out at you give him a couple more

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,290
decades on that Island but nowhere was

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,630
this craziness better exemplified than

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,060
the Japanese shoot him up genre that's a

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,009
dam this meant no-holds-barred you can

17
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,420
make a game about an artichoke that

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,400
shoots Scud missiles and it probably

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,560
sell in fact I think that exists I think

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,610
I have that is uploads a

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,860
platinum-selling are the memories with

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,020
this one I still have my nightmares

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,300
well you got your classics like Galaxian

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,950
and Galaga the mothers of all modern

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,850
shoot-'em-ups

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,680
you got your arcade favorites like right

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,259
end twin B R type and radius and then

28
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,160
there are the ones that are a little

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,770
more out there like space carrier or /

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,840
odious then most of them at least make

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,940
some sense but those aren't the ones

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,770
we're talking about today we're gonna

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,240
look at some of the weirder games this

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,729
genre has to offer let's start with

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,500
fantasy zone a classic example of the

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,020
sub genre known as queue time ups

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,490
projective is to destroy flowers in

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,979
pollen and now an old bugs stuff they're

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,870
all really cute and it makes me feel bad

40
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,940
because maybe I'm really the bad guy

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,799
this one stands out because you can

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,479
travel in both directions which was a

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,100
pretty significant deviation from the

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,750
normal side-scrolling or vertical

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,610
scrolling shooter back then you bounce

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,500
back and forth and blow up enemies to

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
collect coins classic you buy power-ups

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,390
for your ship fight a boss and advance

49
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,830
to the next level what's interesting

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,330
here is that it's structured like an

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,400
iPhone game or even like a flash game

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,290
and we all know how popular those kinds

53
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,940
of games have become in recent years so

54
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,190
popular the markets oversaturated to the

55
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,739
brim 30 years worth of foresight damn

56
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,180
sake I want to use that some of that

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,549
nowadays someone had some of that on

58
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,360
this fuck's going on show the ship in

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,610
this game adorably named Opa Opa has

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,080
actually been considered to be one of

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,930
Sega's first mascot characters Wow

62
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,549
to think this guy's up there with the

63
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,160
likes of Alex Kidd Sonic the Hedgehog

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,400
and Billy the sex offender

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,349
what did you is you forget about that

66
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,099

68
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,550
pepto-bismol before you come into work

69
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,420
GCI

70

Harrier actually and surprisingly it's

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,140
pretty fun to play it feels good to move

88
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,060

89
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,980
power-ups oh and then I was just it

90
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,900
appropriate all right what's next on the

91
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,440

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,319
and pure shooting I mean should I be

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,389

94
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,780
show just up dude

95
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,209
highbrow gag and pure shooting sounds

96
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,799
like we're talking about an aristocratic

97
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,870
serial killer what is that supposed to

98
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,200
mean

99
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,530
oh okay so harmful part refers to the

100
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,359
fact that we are literally in a theme

101
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,480
park that is dangerous as in it is

102
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,310
filled with enemies that will harm you

103
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,350
oh I get it now it's like my other

104
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,750
favorite game true sword and lots magic

105
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,889
adventure boy

106
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,410
there's our nomenclature aside this game

107
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,200
is amazing I mean this is simply one of

108
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,940
the best shoot-'em-ups I've ever played

109
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,620
and I've never heard of it up until now

110
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,419
you got weapons like pie which is

111
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,389
throwing pies ice okay that's totally

112
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,919
ice we're looking at potato and Jim

113
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,720
Jerry Jerry

114
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,020
John's getting upset I'm willing to take

115
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,450
a guess they meant jelly like in jelly

116
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,010
bean because that's what it looks like

117
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,040
you're shooting oh my god well this

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,660
guy's got a cat living in his head so

119
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,010
that might explain the whole anger thing

120
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,820
there that Frankenstein just flipped me

121
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,680
the double bird and then lasers came out

122
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,190
two can play at that game

123
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,900
now I'm gonna wager the only truly a

124
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
harmful thing in this part is me you

125
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,100
know the lady shooting lasers and

126
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,250
everything okay next up is a game called

127
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,490
ko flying squadron for the Sega CD least

128
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,890
this one has a somewhat normal name in

129
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,440
the eighth year of the KO era Japan

130
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,750
neared the end of its feudal period the

131
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,760
Shogun facing an uprising by the

132
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,860
anti-government movement asked friends

133
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,120
for military health emergency

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,070
as the French were unwilling to assist

135
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,930
the government turned to the American

136
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,500
delegation that was visiting Japan

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,900
see America was known as the country

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,370
which had established a unique

139
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,740
scientific technology uh is that gonna

140
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,730
be on the test

141
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,350
oh I get it now history science this

142
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,330
game is great too honestly it plays well

143
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,340
just like harmful part the animations

144
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,720
are really smooth and it's got that

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,970
whole Japanese mythological style going

146
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,950
on but it's uh it's a bit overshadowed

147
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,530
by the

148
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,630
I'm scared I'm moving on when I set out

149
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,920
to make this episode there were two

150
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,510
specific games I had in mind that I

151
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,250
wanted to play to that really stood

152
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,590
above the rest the first one samurais

153
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,210
zombie nation as you can see I think

154
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,470
this is really gonna be a treat just

155
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:44,860
based on the cover oh is that a witch

156
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,780
hey buddy you all right you got a sneeze

157
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,150
somebody get this guy a tissue and also

158
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,100
maybe a paperweight as he seems to be

159
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,960
getting caught in this light breeze oh

160
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,770
and also what was that 1999 what

161
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,020
appeared to be a harmless meteorite yeah

162
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,580
I'm not sure harmless is the word I've

163
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,830
used for that crashing into the Nevada

164
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,860
desert had turned out to be dark sea oh

165
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,600
no not him an evil alien creature with

166
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,090
horrible powers all right we're fine

167
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,070
then they just said his powers suck

168
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,220
dark seed had turned the helpless nation

169
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,680
into zombies and had brought the Statue

170
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,020
of Liberty to life to do his dirty work

171
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,750
but what dark seed didn't realize is

172
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,000
that she's too big to do inside people

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,980
things so he had to come to terms with

174
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,140
doing his own laundry most of the time

175
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,990
these Rays had also given him control

176
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,180
over many deadly weapons but none were

177
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,130
more powerful than the legendary samurai

178
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,680
sword Shura when the great head of the

179
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,930
samurai nama Kuby heard that the sword

180
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,060
had fallen into evil hands he set off

181
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,360
immediately for United States all right

182
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,790
familiar territory first level New York

183
00:07:51,790 --> 00:08:11,370
know it like the back of my hand

184
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,650
continue well yes absolutely I don't

185
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,539
ever want to stop doing that ever

186
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,849
whenever it so when they said the great

187
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,740
head of the samurai

188
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,810
well they literally meant his actual

189
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,020
head oh my god wire how now I'm not too

190
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,000
sure if I'm the bad guy or the good guy

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,009
because I kind of look like the bad guy

192
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,380
right now but then again bad guys don't

193
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,490
go left to right

194
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,399
what is it happening here first of all

195
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,440
this looks like Las Vegas not New York

196
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,419
now I'm not quite really sure how this

197
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,300
works at all I'm shootin eyeballs out my

198
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,399
head coughing up remnants of my trachea

199
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,560
to the people below and I think my life

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,959
is measured in a Bobo's can we look at

201
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:50,709
this for a moment

202
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,089
I'm a goddamn severed head of an

203
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,769
emperors ghost come over from his creepy

204
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,750
doghouse in Japan to the United States

205
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,420
to save everyone by killing everyone

206
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,579
where did this guy learn how to save a

207
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,370
country the United States and yes this

208
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,410
is supposed to be the good guy in the

209
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,180
intro it says he comes over to stop

210
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,910
darksied and save the helpless Americans

211
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,589
are we sure are helpless there's no

212
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:13,360
doubt there but I don't know about the

213
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,820
whole same thing can you tell me that if

214
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,190
this is what the good guy is doing what

215
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,130
is the bad guy doing I need to see that

216
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,850


217
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,980
how many eyeballs that guy got in his

218
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,930
eyes I'm the Y ball scientist but I

219
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,670
don't think you get to have that many

220
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,070
eyeballs all right we have seen some

221
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,050
pretty crazy stuff today but we've only

222
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,839
got one game left Cho Aniki I mean what

223
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,220
could this possibly throw at us to

224
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,959
surprise us I mean we've seen it all by

225
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:52,840
now

226
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,620
I'm speechless

227
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,330
quite literally I don't I don't even

228
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,860
need to say anything I think this does

229
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,150
the talking for me

230
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,630
well here's Cho Aniki a game for the

231
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,890
PlayStation 1 that was uh something you

232
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,870
can pick from a guy or a girl character

233
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,490
and they both look so enticing don't

234
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,850
they

235
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,370
which one you gonna pick ha uh here's

236
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,260
the story willing to guess we don't need

237
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,930
to listen to this

238
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,700
okay maybe we didn't need to listen to

239
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,779
it after all no not my wiener my one

240
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,820
weakness so it doesn't matter what

241
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,470
happens you have to play that part

242
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,810
before the actual game begins I don't

243
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,460
even know if it has any bearing on the

244
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,860
actual gameplay I even sat here and

245
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,600
played until it ended naturally without

246
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,300
me dying and nothing happens you know

247
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,220
this may come as a surprise but I still

248
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,020
don't know what the is going on you

249
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,760
got a lady shoot lasers with two angels

250
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,830
you got muscular guys scooting by own

251
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,230
computer chairs muscular guys Pogo

252
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,910
chicken on other muscular guys it looks

253
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,529
like Adams back there waiting for God to

254
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:03,140
come create him oh hey there how are you

255
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,930
huh oh okay what do I have to pay to

256
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,160
have you never look at me like that

257
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,180
again

258
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,950
what did I just see was that Arnold

259
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,170
Schwarzenegger with a comb-over sticking

260
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,970
out his HR Giger date I'm not looking

261
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,950
again oh that's what it was oh that's

262
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,529
what it is that's the last one it's over

263
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,290
I literally can't believe what I'm

264
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,089
looking at I honestly can't believe it

265
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,100
it's a self-defense mechanism all right

266
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,490
buddy

267
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,290
don't get too happy about this

268
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:48,239
Oh oh my god what is that oh Lord I

269
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,949
think I'm coming down with a case of the

270
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:56,429
vapors I have fallen and I choose not to

271
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:56,999
get up

272
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,579
well at least Pope Francis decided to

273
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:00,209
show up

274
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,309
presumably to perform an exorcism on his

275
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,169
 I got to tell you without this guy

276
