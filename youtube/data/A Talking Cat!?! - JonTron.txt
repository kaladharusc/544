jontron

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,760
I guess hating all those Mondays really

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,250

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,780
you that's not the only talking cat I

8
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,640
got in this house and know by the way

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,660
I'm not referring to talking tom I'm

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,129
referring of course in the state of the

11
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,360
art called classic hit a talking cat

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,530
exclamation point question mark

13
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,440
exclamation point so for your viewing

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,570
displeasure and without further ado I

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,200
did be the tidings of a talking cat oh

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,580
look this film was produced by the

17
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,280
Fantastic Four oh I'm really liking what

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,840
they've done with it here well I guess

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,250
this is as good a time as any to show

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:34,070
you guys my new revamped logo do you

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,590
like it the movie starts with like a

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,810
minute of establishing shots like any of

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,210
these ultra low-budget films do really

24
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,460
trying to squeeze every last bit to hit

25
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,680
that feature-length finish line I like

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,180
the wood what who's speaking

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,070
is it the cat or did the director just

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,689
leave the mic on in the editing Bay and

29
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,310
forget to take it out sounds like you

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,630
might have had one too many he's

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,009
straight on to giving life lessons to

32
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,070
anyone in earshot I've heard them say

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,359
it's a simple things we should

34
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,560
appreciate most and right now it's a

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,810
wind in the trees and the smells in the

36
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,170
air this place has

37
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,580
sir you're polluting the audio you speak

38
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,590
when spoken to market so um there's a

39
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,989
cat rolling around you know we're not I

40
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,420
know as much as you do at this point and

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,670
there it is folks

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,860
that's how you know this is real this is

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,780
happening the person titling this movie

44
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,610
was clearly just as confused as the rest

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,260
of us hmm nothing says home quite like a

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,690
dead tree honey I'm home oh wait is this

47
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,129
my house I think this might actually be

48
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,920
the local art museum huh

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,379
if only I was twice as rich what is this

50
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,120
house did they just rent this for the

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,829
few days they were shooting I guess we

52
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,359
know where the budget went is that a

53
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,700
fucking tree we're in high heels in the

54
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,010
corner of the house what's going on what

55
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,269
the hell does this house belong to a

56
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,230
serial killer

57
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,359
is there a woman's body inside of that

58
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:06,890
tree where is she that's not even a

59
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,109
scripted thing that's just really just

60
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:10,609
walked in there and said hey is that a

61
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:13,220
tree wearing shoes it's gonna be one of

62
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,680
those days by the way very interesting

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,230
observation coming from a man who has a

64
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,720
half a car in his living room within the

65
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,730
same shot I think when this is not the

66
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,079
weirdest thing in frame at any one given

67
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,880
point in time you know you're on to

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,940
something magical yeah dad

69
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,500
every day with this shit every day I'm

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,510
sitting here reading my book your walks

71
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,980
in the door make a card oh is that me

72
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,970
I'm supposed to like it

73
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,090
oh fuck you dad and honestly if it was a

74
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,459
choo-choo train noise maybe I would left

75
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,109
the car noise before I look like you

76
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:50,090
some sort of big baby they go too far

77
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,889
for this one so after the painstaking

78
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,900
intro we meet these two fellows the

79
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,430
father comes home to say that he's sold

80
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,690
his vague company along with all its

81
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,829
assets so what's over the company what

82
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,810
does the company do I don't know what

83
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,579
did itself I don't know either

84
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,790
something about code we sold the website

85
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,280
the websites interface the interface to

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,319
code that I worked half my life on oh

87
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,239
god I could understand the interface but

88
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
you saw the crowd think of who you're

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,900
affecting now they say that I've got

90
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,820
enough money to retire who says that

91
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,769
didn't you already have enough

92
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,259
that's what they say whose day what are

93
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,349
they saying that for guess I'll hang out

94
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,289
here at the house for a while that we

95
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,729
could spruce it up a little bit

96
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,830
didn't you our decorator well they get

97
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,449
mad they keep referencing the

98
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,919
decorations and even the fact that they

99
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,870
used an interior designer I'm assuming

100
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,129
this is because the director knew the

101
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,659
house looked out of place what was I

102
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,220
thinking maybe we could go on those

103
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,280
trips that we talked about electrics

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
held my son's lifeless body in my arms

saying it in the moment really strange

194

202
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,980
I'm tell us on the porch

203
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,870
oh is it does right there you know

204
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,580
direct line of sight well I got him

205
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,710
found a mom can I have my weekly rations

206
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,010
now hi there

207
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,560
okay we got a regular zoologist here he

208
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,690
recognized that cat like like that oh

209
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,820
you can see the damn laser pointer they

210
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,710
didn't even try you can also see cat

211
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,240
food on the ground right next to the cat

212
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,410
everywhere it is so they could get it to

213
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,160
sit there clean so but it takes real

214
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,950
magic to make the right people at the

215
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,380
right time so yes as it turns out the

216
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,030
voice is definitely the inner monologue

217
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,010
of the cat he talks about helping these

218
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,500
people which he or they give no reason

219
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,180
for so the old man walks outside to once

220
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,890
again find the cat and it's revealed

221
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,780
that the name of the cat is Duffy also I

222
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,250
think this cat knows this movie's gonna

223
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,600
be bad for its career and reputation

224
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,460
seeing as the man has to keep breaking

225
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,140
its neck back in a position to keep it

226
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,850
looking at the camera totally this job

227
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,880
run my ears oh no Duffy slammed a few

228
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,530
back again keep calm and keep rubbing

229
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,480
okay well maybe you can get some Sun out

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,150

231
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,190
off now be great um excuse me what we

232
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,780
are where now that's supposed to be

233
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,370
where they live they clearly were like

234
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,350
in LA or Arizona or something like that

235
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,430
and then they just showed an

236
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,930

237
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,550
hemisphere small world huh

238
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,500
no look literally very small a very

239
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,260
small world for that to be possible

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,540
did someone mention my name okay and

241
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,280

242
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,230
what the relation is at all by the way

243
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,660
is this laptop massive or is she just

244
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,490
very tiny unlike some people I heard

245
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,660

now that's taste so apparently according

284
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,600
to what the cat refers to as the rules

285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
you can only speak to someone like that

286
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,010
like meaning where his lips move once

287
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,930

talking to me why is there a cat in here

296
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,700
ah did you just glaze over the fact that

297
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,890
your daughter said that the cat spoke to

298
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,590
her she's clearly speaking from our

299
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,100
point of view

300
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,690
maybe it's her read should I get it to

301
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,660
milk it talks like it doesn't just me

329
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,230
to stray cats because that makes no

330
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,540
sense at all he decides to go on a walk

331
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,160
to calm his nerves and wait wait a

332
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,840
second I thought they lived by the beach

333
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,910
in like Guam now we're like what in the

334
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,710
Pacific Northwest he could just walk

335
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,810
that far they must pay a lot of money to

336
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,420
reside in this multi biosphere realm you

337
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:44,760
can get it all here you see them talking

338
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,630
cat what is that a talking cat words

339
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,280
came out of that mouth no I'm not

340
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,900
believing that you didn't tell me how

341
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,820
the cat will talk to me there's a caller

342
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:10,650
Myers Warren gave me your cat you're

343
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,780
human and now I'm about to blow my

344
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,660
fucking brains out I just want to point

345
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,280
out that his reaction to the cat

346
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,410
speaking directly to him is more

347
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,490
underwhelmed than when he just

348
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,700
originally saw the cat normally okay I'm

349
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,310
a talking cat remember that just makes

350
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:34,520
me crazy I have plenty of imagination oh

351
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,470
wait no you're kidding me they're

352
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,570
neighbors you juggled these plots for

353
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,160
this long to have them bump into each

354
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,930
other 40 minutes in I really thought

355
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,100
they were on different parts of the

356
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,170
globe wait you're not a crazy person

357
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,210
right I mean no offense ah yes the

358
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,160
classic psychiatric evaluation for all

359
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,410
crazy people you just walk up yo you

360
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:52,950
crazy

361
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,690
what a crazy stranger do

362
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,190
like aggressively walk closer to you

363
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,840
after you ask him that question so she

364
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,180
lets a perfect stranger into her house

365
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,130
and they talk about cheese puffs or some

366
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,140
cheese puffs I'm not joking

367
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,240
my son doesn't think so oh you have a

368
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,580
son how old so a wonderful twilight

369
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,200
years romance blossoms here and then

370
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,920
they become friends I guess why don't

371
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,640
you make it your own

372
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,680
well I don't have much taste I mean look

373
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,720

374
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,060
dragged in he's in boys he did it he

375
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:27,840

376
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,130
excuse me let me I'll grab him out of

377
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,300
this oven here with my bare hands

378
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,610
without any hesitation just this guy

379
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,100
it's just fill our neighbor don't freak

380
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,860
out don't freak out you were warned Phil

381
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,870
you didn't listen so it actually starts

382
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,550
getting a bit weird these two are

383
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,530
getting along but then as he drops her

384
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,120
tray that she really needed for some

385
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,130
catering event she gets like actually

386
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,880
mad oh no they were dropped right side

387
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,330
up completely protected by 10 foil buy

388
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,070
you some more I'm sure it's not that big

389
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:06,420
of a deal mom so it just gets awkward he

390
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,949
suggests the way to fix it but the mom

391
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,740
just like is lastingly mad at him and we

392
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,329
were even rooting for him at this point

393
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,670
cheese that's real pain but there's got

394
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,500
to be something I can do yeah you know

395
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,270
what you could go really

396
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,280
uh-uh we'll be fine

397
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,230
so the daughter like tracks Phil down in

398
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,179
the woods and follows him home and then

399
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,950
I don't even know the brother comes

400
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,110
looking for his sister and somehow finds

401
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,910
their house which he's never been to

402
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,010
before and well it just really starts to

403
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,470
railing from here hey do you think I

404
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:47,970
could take a swim oh no Phil that is

405
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,049
unacceptable

406
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,200
I expect more from my kids and you know

407
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,540
what I barely know you

408
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,280
yeah well then maybe we should hang out

409
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:16,679
sometime you're asking me out now Trent

410
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,780
in the car we'll talk about this when we

411
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,910
get home in the future could you take

412
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,549
your walk on a different trail everybody

413
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,770
feeling good here yeah it was nice nice

414
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,390
little movie about a talking cat yeah

415
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,490
okay and then there's this totally

416
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,380
derivative scene okay really pissed me

417
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,120
off how easy it was to see this coming

418
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,650
and you probably already know what I'm

419
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,970
gonna say Oh cam of course talking about

420
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,280
the scene where they scan clothes with a

421
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,500
fucking bedside worm light for over two

422
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,570
literal minutes to test this girl's

423
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,929
algorithm for how to dress best on a

424
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,140
computer program that she made it needed

425
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,030
Phil's website for some reason what you

426
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,559
didn't see that coming also there's this

427
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,210
part where I think they accidentally

428
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,940
synced up his lines to the music

429
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,930
scare ya yep scare ya yep so after all

430
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,000
this guess this is where the cat's help

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,100
comes into play he goes to once and for

432
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,850
all solved their domestic dispute well

433
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,470
that can't eat talking no more I'll tell

434
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,190
you that much

435
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,830
what the fuck the cat gets hit by a car

436
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,720
the first time I watched that I thought

437
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,730
I was just missing the point but no he

438
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,980
really gets it Susan so the gang all

439
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,900
shows up to see the state of the cat's

440
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,370
health and I can't believe I'm actually

441
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,890
saying this we found him the vet has

442
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,950
made him comfortable but oh God

443
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,840
comfortable is the last thing you ever

444
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,920
want to be when you're being

445
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,120

446
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:55,830
Oh God Duffy are you gonna be okay boy

447
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,150

the clinic I can't believe they're

454
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,820
actually trying to pass this off this is

455
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,470
a movie or a money laundering scheme

456
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,570
somebody made this decision behind the

457
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,250
scenes I'll tell you what he he does

458
