1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,620
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,449
YouTube a boogie2988 coming at you

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:04,920
laughs let's get into the power of the

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,450
Internet in its 4th of July and I

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,000
thought I would show you guys the party

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,380
I planned and show you the party itself

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,380
and probably some grainy photos of

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,880
fireworks I'm currently wearing a Rick

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,020
and Morty shirt because I just realized

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,560
I didn't purchase anything new for

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,029
fourth of July so I'm gonna have to try

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,010
to find something that'll work

13
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,720
let me show you the problem though this

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,949
is my current closet

15
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,439
and he's just a new button-downs that

16
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,750
purchased since the surgery and most of

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,460
these are already too big then I've got

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,800
some shirts that are too small then I'm

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,510
really fit the bill anyway be that

20
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,600
Deadpool shirt actually is kind of red

21
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,340
and then we've got some of the t-shirts

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,610
there's more Deadpool Teenage Dream I'm

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,860
just gonna have to sell something red I

24
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,320
think this is a real issue but I do have

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,110
all these cool lootcrate t-shirts maybe

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,670
one of them will work alright well I

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,780
really don't like the way this shirt

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,410
fits God I'm so gross

29
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,809
alright I found something doesn't work I

30
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,409
mean at least is red laces right alright

31
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,680
and here is the fireworks we're doing

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,930
this year there's this pile right here

33
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,840
there's this big pile of mortars we got

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,100
bottle rockets so I think we have to be

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,420
really very limited with the bottle

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,009
rockets then we get a bunch of fountains

37
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,110
even more mortars we got more mortars

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,479
than we could possibly set off I overdid

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,960
it this year but it's worth it cuz it's

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,400
it's my first fourth of July since the

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,869
divorce and I just wanted to go big so

42

52
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,939
little bit in your life a little bit of

53
