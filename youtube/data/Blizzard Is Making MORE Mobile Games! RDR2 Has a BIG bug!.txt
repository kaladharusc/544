1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,709
what's up ladies and gentleman of

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,510
YouTube but boogie2988 coming at your

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,859
levels again through the power of the

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,029
Internet and this is my weekly gaming

5
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,099
news series and it's been quite the

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,620
weird week in gaming so let's get right

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,210
into the games I wanted to talk a little

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,580
bit about this whole Diablo Fiasco and

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,260
if you haven't seen what happened

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,180
there's a dedicated video about it here

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
on the channel but long story short at

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,740
Blizzcon Activision / Blizzard announced

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,859
their new Diablo game and it is a mobile

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,990
game and everybody they're booed and

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,760
then the internet boot along with them

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,180
and then a crap storm happened on the

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,670
internet it got real salty for a while

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,250
and this led the gamers getting called

19
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,629
entitled and and saying that we were

20
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,100
complaining and we should vote with our

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,110
wallets well you know who else felt

22
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,480
entitled you know who else voted with

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,820
our wallets the folks who own Activision

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,920
was stock Activision stock dropped about

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,100
6 percent in value and is now slowly but

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,890
surely recovering but man those stupid

27
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,320
entitled stockholders if you weren't

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,550
paying attention to social media for the

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,410
next few days after that announcement it

30
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,300
pretty much was an internet culture war

31
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,820
as we seen before a lot of people making

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,409
fun of gamers calling them entitled

33
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,729
calling them worthless calling him

34
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,680
childish calling him stupid calling us

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,990
anything other than you know consumers

36
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,939
which is what we are you know I think I

37
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,229
think it's all right to criticize a

38
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,270
product I specifically when it's a

39
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,860
beloved franchise who you're expecting

40
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,200
to come out on PC and instead is moved

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,610
to mobile now one of the biggest

42
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,259
criticisms I've heard and I've also said

43
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,330
this myself is the biggest mistake they

44
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,950
made over there at Blizzcon was not

45
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,110
announcing Diablo forest potential

46
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,700
release date not showing part of the

47
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
game showing a trailer for Diablo 4 now

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,229
Jason Schreyer over a Kotaku said an

49
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,360
unnamed source told him they were

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,369
prepared to show some Diablo 4 but

51
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,649
pulled it at the last minute but as much

52
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,930
as we wish that were true the folks over

53
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,729
at Diablo actually said that that is not

54
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,380
the case they said we generally don't

55
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,540
comment on rumors or speculation but we

56
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,770
can say that we didn't pull any

57
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,600
announcements from Blizzcon this year or

58
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,759
have plans for other announcements and

59
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,079
then finally one last piece of news

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,909
about Diablo immortal if you guys are

61
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,409
paying attention to the YouTube trailer

62
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,850
one of the ways gamers let their voice

63
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,649
be heard these days is by liking or

64
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,990
disliking a trailer leaving comments on

65
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,509
the YouTube trailer Diablo Mortal is no

66
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,259
exception

67
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,120
player showed up in Mass to dislike this

68
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,840
trailer and it currently sets at 5

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,250
and 22,000 dislikes to 20,000 likes now

70
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,330
there's plenty of rumors floating around

71
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,610
that YouTube and Blizzard somehow

72
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,830
finagled away to get a lot of dislikes

73
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,930
removed but at 500 2,000 dislikes that's

74
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,910
still plenty but if you look at the

75
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,709
website social blade which tracks those

76
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:30,940
kinds of things it does look like

77
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,280
dislikes were originally put there and

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,970
disappeared

79
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,590
that could be bahding it could be

80
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,810
YouTube purging stuff or it could be the

81
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,280
folks over at Blizzard paying off

82
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
YouTube to remove them though I think

83
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,510
it's most likely just BOTS regardless

84
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,280
the folks over at Activision Blizzard

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
have definitely taken a blow here a 6

86
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,420
percent stock blow a 6 percent

87
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,760
company value blow as well as a moral

88
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,470
blow as well and they are in full-on

89
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,540
damage control what this means for

90
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,700
Diablo 4 what it means for Diablo mortal

91
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,560
what it means for Blizzard as a company

92
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,360
still remains to be seen but it is

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,870
easily one of the biggest blunders of

94
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,250
2018 and gaming and we've had some

95
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,870
pretty big blunders already now I will

96
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,700
say in previous other videos I have said

97
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,650
what made me so upset about this

98
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,239
announcement but I'm curious are you

99
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,709
someone who got upset about this and if

100
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,269
you were let me know in the comments

101
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:16,690
section below

102
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,120
what specifically upset you was it the

103
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,590
fact that there was no Diablo 4

104
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,209
announcement is the fact that the Diablo

105
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,709
franchise is coming to mobile and if it

106
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,420
is because it's coming to mobile what

107
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,400
upsets you specifically is the fact that

108
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,780
when asked whether or not this version

109
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,700
of the game would ever come to PC people

110
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,310
got told no what is it that let you get

111
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,690
so upset let me know in the comment

112
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,980
section below I'm looking forward to

113
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,600
reading them now if you are like most

114
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,890
people and are playing Red Dead

115
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,049
Redemption 2 on a console you should

116
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,790
know there is a potentially game

117
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,280
breaking bug that you might run into and

118
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,209
I thought it would warn you because

119
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,220
there's currently no fix as of the time

120
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,690
of recording this though there's one on

121
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,489
the way according to Rockstar now this

122
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,840
video is proudly sponsored by the folks

123
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,910
over at privacy calm / boogie who took

124
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,620
care of one of my biggest problems for

125
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,510
me if you're anything like me you are

126
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,190
constantly afraid of your credit card

127
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,750
number getting stolen when you use it

128
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,730
online or you use it for services and

129
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,440
someone hitting your account with

130
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,389
fraudulent charges fortunately the folks

131
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,340
over at privacy calm make sure that

132
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,889
never happens again instead of using

133
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,269
your basic credit card number which

134
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,069
could get leaked and people could put

135
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,720
charges on privacy allows you to

136
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
generate a brand new card number that

137
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,500
you can use for a long time or you could

138
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,840
use for just a one-time purchase imagine

139
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,039
you want to make a one-time purchase

140
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,690
from a website but you don't want to

141
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,580
give them your actual credit card number

142
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,560
can actually generate a brand new card

143
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,750
and set the spinning limit per charge

144
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,759
per month per year or even just a

145
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,500
one-time total and then it's a burner

146
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,030
card that disappears afterwards or

147
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,169
imagine you want to sign up for a free

148
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,849
trial for a service but you want to make

149
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,009
sure they never actually bill you this

150
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,419
is a great way to do it too you just

151
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,250
create a brand-new card number

152
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,620
assign it a nickname set the spending

153
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,240
limit and then when they try to bill you

154
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,919
at the end of the free trial hey they

155
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,719
never can but there are so many more

156
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,460
uses imagine you've got a kid and you

157
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,479
want to make sure they're only spending

158
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,610
so much on the App Store are spending so

159
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,349
much on V bucks you can give them a card

160
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,610
number with a spending limit of like

161
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,229
twenty bucks a month and make sure they

162
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,120
never break you buying V bucks

163
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,830
privacy is easily one of the most useful

164
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,750
sponsors I've ever had I know that you

165
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,099
will use the service and I know I'm

166
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,139
going to use it every single day so why

167
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,270
don't you check it out a privacy calm /b

168
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,629
oh oh

169
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,060
gie and if you sign up today they will

170
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,490
give you five free bucks on your first

171
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,110
purchase so I hope that you do and

172
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,819
you'll be supporting me at the same time

173
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,139
now if you're anything like me you're

174
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,789
not very far into Chapter two so you're

175
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,949
just hunting and fishing and stealing

176
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:29,650
horses and carts for profit so you might

177
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,300
not have run into this bug just yet and

178
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,520
if you did run into it you might have

179
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,590
some serious issues dealing with these

180
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,599
characters later on but in Chapter two

181
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:39,699
there's a quest that if you use a retry

182
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,009
checkpoint you will end up losing

183
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,960
characters from your camp who will only

184
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,180
ever come back to camp if they have a

185
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,919
mission to give you if you complete the

186
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,930
mission polite society Valentine style

187
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,580
at the start of chapter two but needed

188
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,229
to use the retry checkpoint feature then

189
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,479
Sadie Jack John and Abigail will only

190
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,669
appear in camp when they have missions

191
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,990
for you to complete

192
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,129
so you haven't done that question

193
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,210
chapter two then you have nothing to

194
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,620
worry about if you have done that quest

195
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,089
in Chapter two then you may have noticed

196
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,219
some of those characters are not in camp

197
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,139
and hopefully that's what Rockstar is

198
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,400
going to fix but if you're just starting

199
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,740
the game now a week late know that you

200
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,120
should be very very careful when it

201
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,699
comes time to do that mission though the

202
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,500
good news is this is a pretty rare thing

203
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,139
Red Dead Redemption 2 is relatively bug

204
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,240
free now I've still seen some simple

205
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,409
little bugs like you know characters

206
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,300
walking into walls or characters

207
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,620
floating a little bit or something along

208
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,509
that lines but let's be honest compared

209
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,279
to the launch of Red Dead Redemption 1

210
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,370
then this is a much less buggy game so

211
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,020
kudos to the folks at Rockstar and I

212
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,669
hope they get this fixed quick now going

213
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,529
back to Activision / Blizzard and when

214
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,520
it comes to stuff like diablo mortal you

215
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,750
thank the folks over at Blizzard might

216
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,789
have gotten the message that maybe we

217
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,039
are not ready to move on to mobile just

218
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,440
yet and the PC / console market is still

219
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,690
a very large market share if not a very

220
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,150
vocal market share well it doesn't look

221
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,710
like that's the case based on something

222
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,840
I just read seconds ago after the a

223
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,090
Diablo Immortal announcement Allen Adham

224
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,090
said during a QA that many of us over

225
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,229
the last few years have shifted from

226
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:05,210
playing primarily desktop to playing

227
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,009
many hours on mobile and we have many of

228
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,440
our best developers now working on new

229
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,960
mobile titles across all of our IPs some

230
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,370
of them are with external partners like

231
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,300
Diablo immortal

232
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,440
many of them are being developed

233
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,659
internally only it'll have information

234
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:20,389
to share on those in the future so it

235
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,440
looks like we're gonna do this song and

236
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,180
dance a few more times before Blizzard

237
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,130
learns the lesson hopefully they'll

238
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,539
learn the lesson maybe they won't and

239
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,520
they'll just go the way of the dodo but

240
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,710
if you are upset about Diablo mobile

241
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,020
wait till you see Warcraft mobile or

242
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,389
world of warcraft Mobile or Starcraft

243
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,090
mobile oh god oh how the mighty have

244
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,870
fallen

245
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,000
I still love Blizzard but I wish they

246
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
weren't doing this to us

247
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm so depressed now I'm just gonna wrap

248
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,310
