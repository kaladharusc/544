I bought that mustache for this game

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600

43
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,750
initially during your first few hours

44
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,680
it's got these insanely fun bursts of

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,660
dynamic gameplay that really make you

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,310
feel like a real live pirate I said but

47
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,859
I'm not gonna show you should I shoot

48
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,130
him I shot him

49
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,380
shut up don't shoot the people on the

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:04:13,690
island and as you crew your 4 man ship

51
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,300
cooperating to defend and attack other

52
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,820
pirates and just scream and argue with

53
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,500
each other as you attempt to load the

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,330
cannons you're getting hit you're

55
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,880
plugging holes you're scooping water out

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,700
of your ship and cooperating it's it's

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,230
so much fun

58
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,560
baby pain you shall know the name of the

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,970
ship sexual chocolate commanded by

60
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:51,500
Richard James

61
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,580
show them our fire power no fire you see

62
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,550
that get up on us coming our chaos ship

63
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,430
because chances are you probably don't

64
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,220
even have any booty aboard and there's

65
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,130
really no reason to attack you and board

66
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,720
you because it's a very small window

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,670
where maybe we'll get something but

68
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,560
honestly there's really nothing to get

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,890
with only or for weapons in the game and

70
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,430
don't you let your guard down maybe

71
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,440
we're gonna come grape you because we're

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,850
bar

73
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,040
unfortunately what kills the whole thing

74
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,000
is that it is literally an empty shells

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,220
but look just cuz there's no way to

76
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,490
upgrade your ship or make it better and

77
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,860
prove your pirate or get skill points or

78
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,080
really do anything does it mean that

79
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,930
you're not a pirate we are pirates

80
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:56,090
yeah no it's fool's gold

81
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,540
I tell ya it's it's lacking in so much

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,290
content and it's so shockingly dull at

83
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,790
times it feels more like a $15.00 Xbox

84
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,280
Live Arcade game and if it was that I

85
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,290
would be screaming from the mountaintops

86
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,750
to buy the game and supported it and add

87
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,360
more content bar content is coming Joe

88
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm revealing it now and this is one of

89
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,510
the most disappointing titles I've had

90
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,200
to review in a long time I can't believe

91
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:35,830
it I could have just bought

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,139
[Music]

93
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,449
it's an experience okay Joe combined

94
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,050
we've all I don't mind me I'm still wait

95
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,120
you're not a $60 you fun already

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,270
I have I gotta wait six days it's

97
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,409
exactly what I wanted from a pirate game

98
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,620
without anything in it it's literally

99
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,229
20% of a game half a game less than that

100
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,780
I poured through all the preview videos

101
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,090
that Microsoft was pushing this as hard

102
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,449
as an Xbox exclusive this this adventure

103
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,690
this huge thing they go on these wild

104
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,669
adventures they even created controllers

105
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,099
for and special editions and made that

106
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,530
big marketing push one of the things

107
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,479
that rare is done consistently over

108
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,139
three decades is evolved as a studio

109
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,389
rare has redefined genres with its own

110
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,849
special formula and we're ready to do

111
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,430
that again set in a fantastical world

112
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,289
this game will bring players together

113
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,139
and give them the freedom to play with

114
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,590
limitless possibilities this is by far

115
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,500
the most ambitious game rare has ever

116
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,300
created Xbox one exclusive world

117
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,419
premiere and what's delivered here feels

118
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,120
like a far cry from what was promised a

119
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,819
year ago we announced our most ambitious

120
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,969

pirate world and the freedom of living

123
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,860
the pirate life nest-egg hoarded by the

124
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,099
pitiful buckaroo bets stash robbed by

125
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,800
the pitiful scourge Oberg and let me

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
guess is he pitiful a swag snatched by

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,250

128

treasure where fantastical creatures

132
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,190

134
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,410
oh we got the captain right here captain

135
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,649
and we did it where the potential threat

136
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,259
of other players always lurks over the

137
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,930
horizon okay if you got cosmetics for

138
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,300
pvping and had like a faction ring too

139
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,129
bad there isn't there's no point serves

140
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:04,949
no purpose sea of thieves is an emergent

141
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,959
experience where you will have limitless

142
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,829
adventures for walking around and

143
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,290
farting around

144
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,970
Fortin around you know I want to fart

145
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,800
around with you guys for sure but I also

146
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,790
want a game worth $60 yeah it feels a

147
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,769
lot like a twenty or thirty dollar game

148
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,899
and even then it fills early access on

149
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,269
the world of sea of thieves seeds with

150
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,550
possibilities with adventure skulking

151
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,490
above and below the waves all you have

152
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,379
to do is jump in and up careful though

153
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,850
there could be anything down there

154
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,339
literally there could be anything we

155
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,290
haven't finished designing it yet joking

156
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,670
that was a joke every player's decisions

157
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,649
and discoveries will be different but

158
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,600
however you plan on seeking your fortune

159
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,230
and it pays to be prepared

160
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,610
that is not a beast you want to pick a

161
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,100
fight with yes it's possible to take on

162
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,569
these two thee't errors of the deep

163
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:15,720
you're not much used to your crew down

164
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:24,569
what do I get for killing a shark good

165
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:29,009
job why is it not filled with content

166
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,699
why is it essentially a sandbox it's

167
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,970
it's no man see

168
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,319
I've heard that so many times with

169
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:41,110
people the problem is it's true except

170
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,720
no it's not because even no man's sky

171
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,379
had more content than this game does man

172
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:53,769
I just damn I'm so disappointed right

173
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,259
now and I don't want to admit it the

174
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,139
issue the big issue is that while the

175
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,149
fundamentals of the game are there and

176
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,639
they're extremely solid the graphics are

177
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,679
beautiful and even the animations are

178
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:16,619
ridiculously impressive and funny

179
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:49,899
oh my god all right we're making our own

180
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,529
fun beard come on man relax the rest of

181
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,610
the game just has been slapdash together

182
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,529
what do you do well you do repetitive

183
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,720
pointless quests for one of three

184
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,120
factions the gold hoarders gives you

185
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,089
treasure maps to dig up the soul faction

186
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,509
has you fights skeletons over and over

187
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,639
for skulls and the merchants as you

188
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,309
catching animals over and over these

189
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,759
quests would be laughed out of town in

190
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,199
literally any other game this is by far

191
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:28,089
the most ambitious game rare has ever

192
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,470
created

193
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,880
they are the types of things that you

194
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,710
start with right there like a tutorial

195
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,320
and then that games want to quickly you

196
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,790
know prove to you that they have more

197
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,060
than just this but here that's all there

198
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,330
is paid are you okay

199
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,280
see see what this game does to me

200
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,950
because I like it I see the potential

201
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,290
there but it's not worth it guys and I'm

202
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,630
tired of Xbox fanboys are asking me on

203
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,120
Twitter then all the content is coming

204
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,260
and - please be kind to it guys stop

205
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,750
lying to yourselves what's good is the

206
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,290
concept it's the execution yes there's

207
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,730
bosses you can fight but people were

208
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,340
seriously fighting these and soloing

209
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,950
them in less than two days the AI is

210
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,400
garbage if it even has AI it's so dumb

211
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,160
there's really no enemies outside the

212
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,690
bosses and the skeletons with the

213
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:50,720
skeletons that's it what is this

214
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,110
and once you get tired of that and trust

215
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,640
me you'll be tired of it by the fifth or

216
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:02,060
sixth time there's nothing else it's the

217
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,120
same exact repetitive skeleton identical

218
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,950
plays identical to the one before it

219
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,550
guys were ranked five only like 70

220
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,620
hundred trillion more deliveries 50

221
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,800
levels of this over and over yep okay

222
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,550
we're going straight easy this is by far

223
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,490
the most ambitious game rare has ever

224
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:45,710
created I guess you could do PvP the

225
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,840
issue is is that after the first few

226
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,060
times you realize that Kombat plays out

227
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,790
exactly the same there's literally no

228
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,440
penalty for death one ship is down yep

229
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,340
one's down you got it gotta kill the

230
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,870
other

231
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,059
[Music]

232
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,589
but again like they're just gonna

233
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,359
respond and come back three minutes

234
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:15,399
later because there's no downside whoa

235
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,159
angry we can't do this forever take on

236
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,559
this island was a bunch of players over

237
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,389
and over here they come again all right

238
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,860
well I think I've fucking had enough

239
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,879
[Music]

240
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,349
downside you can't Whittle them down you

241
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:31,909
win like six times in a row and it

242
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,289
doesn't matter cuz they come back with

243
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:36,079
supplies and you know they just come

244
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,849
back with free supplies free cannons

245
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:44,719
free bananas like the default mode it's

246
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,879
just grief and other players how can

247
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,689
this have devolved into just garbage

248
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:54,109
just get on his boat so what options

249
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:57,859
does he have right now that's bonded

250
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:17,190
died and then what else there is

251
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,709
so and you can reload off of his aim and

252
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:22,540
just keep shooting it yeah

253
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,200
that's dumb just gonna stay oh there is

254
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,730
fine all OH

255
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,560
you almost got me but not enough my

256
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,660
friend and now I'm just gonna eat

257
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,670
bananas and then I'm gonna take your

258
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,910
minutes and then I miss you say Delrin

259
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,540
angry Joe oh jeez watching in the side

260
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,630
I'm not participating okay I'm just on

261
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,700
the sidelines no you're participating

262
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,550
job the only progression in the game is

263
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,740
customization of your pirate with some

264
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,560
cosmetic items that's about it that

265
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,760
that's the purpose of this game right

266
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,680
now but even then you can't even

267
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:10,770
freaking see your items that you get I

268
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,299
forgot my haircut and since I can't ever

269
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:23,140
look at my fire ever again that's my

270
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,549
character and if you emote and play some

271
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,190
music or do a dance do a jig then in

272
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,650
that case you can see your stuff and and

273
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,330
there's these moments of just calm

274
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,179
reflection that it's like wow this this

275
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,940
world would be so great if if it had

276
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,460
something to it

277
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:58,080
[Laughter]

278
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,290
it's just hilarious that the only reason

279
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,970
to play the game right now is this is

280
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,550
the little customization pieces and it's

281
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,630
not even that good there's like

282
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,600
seriously for ship all colors it's a day

283
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,230
one patch I get the joke there and I

284
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,540
would have left but the irony is that

285
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,930
the game desperately needs a day one

286
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,890
patch to patch some freaking content in

287
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,040
here and to stabilize the server's as we

288
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
were during our first few days

289
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,120
encountering no one as the service had

290
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,570
some issues we literally one sea of

291
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,370
thieves like there's no way to win sea

292
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,520
of thieves in PvP but me Joe and down

293
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,350
were the first pirate crew the treasure

294
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,290
is all ours win the whole world's

295
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,750
treasure is ours because these servers

296
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,920
are down and nobody catch me where are

297
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,670
you okay

298
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:58,920
no no I just literally died so there's

299
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,160
no enemy AI ships no NPCs walking around

300
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,410
no real trading or economy no guild

301
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,740
system it is a huge boring King grind

302
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,010
okay we'll find the content don't talk

303
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,080
like that we'll find it

304
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,630
joy where is the content I don't see it

305
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,970
the story you know enemies beside

306
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,450
skeletons I see skeletons and skeletons

307
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,490
more skeletons dirty of skeletons we

308
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,290
don't need it you got an interesting

309
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,070
question look for long what is your

310
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,640
mustache do I manage don't know Joe

311
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:51,800
there's nothing here

312
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,280
buzu gifted date of our booty those

313
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,980
thieving bastards ha ha ha very clever

314
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,930
Microsoft it's an absolute shame because

315
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,660
in my opinion this game is capable of a

316
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,110
9 or hell even a 10 out of 10 if it had

317
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,720
the content to back it up if it had the

318
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
quests that are worth a damn if it had

319
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,030
progression if it had meaningful PvP if

320
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,060
it had of this vast world to give you

321
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,640
reasons to explore and right now it just

322
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,440
doesn't this is the most boring game

323
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,560
I've played in a while but it has these

324
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,720
bursts and moments and yes the game is

325
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,850
cheaper if you subscribe to this game

326
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,130
past service then cancel after a few

327
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,700
hours God trust me I wish I had done

328
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,730
that but you think that's what Microsoft

329
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,460
intends for the game just to to make

330
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,930
temporary money and then lose it all

331
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,830
then then why sell it for $60 everywhere

332
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:15,210
else huh don't home that time no

333
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,740
Microsoft store shop finally got my

334
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,650
refund said last 7 days later got a rave

335
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,539
one

336
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,999
hahahaha

337
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:42,519
fire my pirating days are over I wish it

338
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,289
wouldn't registered else purchase or

339
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,479
other Joe's purchase the initial one and

340
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,939
it you click on it it opens the store

341
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:50,769
then you click on us is buy but we

342
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,629
already bought on the other page no joke

343
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,629
they have their refunds pending Joey got

344
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:57,579
his dammit and I wish I could get mine

345
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:00,369
after I realized that I'm done with the

346
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,669
game like I have no desire to play it

347
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,979
any longer the only thing I want to do

348
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:12,039
now is find the damn Kraken this is the

349
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,079
Kraken is there kraken that'd be sweet

350
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:24,729
one girl where oh my god oh my god and

351
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:28,119
that's rare and it's fairly random you

352
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,489
have to be in deep water and let it come

353
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,519
to you but what's worse and what is a

354
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,039
perfect encapsulation of this game get

355
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,329
this you're gonna love this

356
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,449
this amazing Kraken event this awesome

357
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:43,409
epic Battle of encountering a crack and

358
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:46,239
it also ends in disappointment

359
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,149
it's just tentacle 6 if you jump in the

360
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,589
water and try to look at the Kraken

361
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:53,139
there's no body there is nothing under

362
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,939
the actual surface of the water

363
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,889
they hide this fact by making your

364
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,919
screen black you cannot see it and worse

365
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,619
if you manage to defeat or kill the

366
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:05,319
Kraken it really doesn't do anything

367
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,179
it's just it actually kind of just

368
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,119
confusingly goes away and everybody's

369
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,639
like did we did we kill it and you get

370
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:15,519
anything for killing the Kraken no you

371
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,739
get Jack said Jack said Jack Jack Jack

372
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:24,249
said well this isn't exactly as bad as

373
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,289
the center of the galaxy reveal from no

374
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,049
man's sky it's still pretty bad and it

375
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,789
reminds me of that and it's just a

376
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,849
perfect summary for your experience with

377
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,979
the game there's nothing under the

378
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,420
actual surface it

379
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,090
great above water but there's nothing

380
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,260
there for $60 this is a straight ripoff

381
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,060
Microsoft clearly pressed rare beyond

382
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,950
their limits this is a different rare a

383
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,290
new rare I don't know that they need

384
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,120
more employees they need more talent and

385
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,010
more time but they've had a long time

386
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,070
the value proposition is just not there

387
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,920
it is it fun yes for about less than

388
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,810
four hours

389
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,850
after that you will have done and seen

390
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,640
everything unless you want this massive

391
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,310
boring empty grind and if you bought

392
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,930
this with the game pass and then

393
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,720
canceled the game pass well then the

394
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,820
rating would be high a bit higher if you

395
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,610
did that pat yourself on the back sir

396
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,730
because you are the true MVP I mean the

397
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,780
true pirate here well done for the rest

398
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,220
of us we got shit on maybe one day rare

399
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,460
will add more content and more things to

400
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,950
the game but with such a fundamentally

401
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,990
flawed system of zero progression and

402
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,840
paper-thin npcs with zero story this

403
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,390
experience falls well short of its

404
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,950
concept and I'm not sure if it can

405
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,220
actually be fixed - the complete restart

406
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,740
with all those things in a clear vision

407
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,920
in mind I do hope that we see what

408
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,170
trailer players truly wanted here and

409
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,870
make the actual pirate experience with

410
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,360
all this and more maybe and sea of

411
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,650
thieves - but it's not here until then I

412
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,800
hope to see you guys on the next agree

413
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,770
Joe show with a better pirate game this

414
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:36,690
one hurt

415
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,940
you would cheap mustache it's okay for

416
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,200
you come down come down it's here it's

417
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,030
here we just got to look for it where

418
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,540
where's the storage I don't see it

419
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,130

420
00:25:53,130 --> 00:26:00,480
Mustang goddamn your Mustang show you it

421

422
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:16,400
I'm sorry

423
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,210
wait is that it this whole thing is

424
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,170
falling apart

425
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,950
cheap a moustache it's gone we waited

426
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:36,240
