Good evening.

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,860
You're watching pew news I'm Gloria Bor-

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,540
That's right Gloria she quit

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,380
a group of Bears is called a sloth lmao

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,820
I don't know why anyone would pass on such an amazing opportunity

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,260
being news anchor on Pew News

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,240

*Pew news intro music*

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,100
Good evening, I'm Poppy Harlow, welcome to Pew News

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,760
Youtube's most trusted news source on the internet, on YouTube. First story is

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,220
incredibly important. The Prince recently got married, and it turns out

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,200
he got married to...

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,660
a lizard! Lets watch

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,400
[Video] Yo, this is some weird (flipping stuff) right here, guess this is Prince Harry and his girl

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,170
her face

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,500
does not move

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Look at that. Are you (freaking) kidding me?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,820
That's not normal.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,290
[Pewds] Oh my god, uncovered.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,740
You've heard it here first on Pew News. No other news site is going to report this.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,550
Why? Because it's a Madame Tussaud mannequin, and I thought the Queen was scary-looking. Obviously,

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,149
there's something fishy going on here

25
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:35,340
And you rest assured, me, Poppy Harlow is going to dig deep into it, to get you guys the fact, get you guys the truth

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,860
Next story, I think since I'm new here, I want to have my own thing, you know, Gloria had the Pew pew pew, I can't do that

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,100
That's not me. That's Gloria. I found this story to be really interesting,

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,440
it's a- talking about a nine year old placed in rehab for her Fortnite addiction.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,960
She was so addicted, that she wet herself to continue playing.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,060
Jesus christ

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,790
Now, I remember back in the day when I play World of Warcraft and other MMOs.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,480
It was a social thing like all my friends played it.

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,260
So if you didn't play,

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,230
the game, you were basically out of the social group.

35
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,640
So I can understand how games is so important to the youth, especially a game like Fortnite, you talk on mic, you play together.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,360
But it's clearly become over the top. You see all these videos of screeching little kids going

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,800
EEEEEEEEE

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,880

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,680
Get off.

[Kid] Get off what?                                                                               *depacio roblortnite edition*

                        watch these with captions)))                                                                            *depacio roblortnite edition*

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,680
[Kid] Whhyyy?                                                              *depacio roblortnite edition*

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,700

46
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,440
[Kid] Why?                                                                          *depacio roblortnite edition*

47
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,040

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,600
[Kid] But, but...                                                                          *depacio roblortnite edition*

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,740
[Adult] Turn it off, c'mon.                                                 *depacio roblortnite edition*

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,480
[Kid] But I can't just bail on him!                                                *depacio roblortnite edition*

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,060
[Adult] No. Yeah you can                                                   *depacio roblortnite edition*

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Turn it off                                                                        *depacio roblortnite edition*

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,880
*depacio roblortnite edition*

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,380
*holy hecc*

55
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,860
[Kid] *crying*

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,360
f

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
*crying*

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,900
[Adult] I was joking.

59
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,160
you have summoned satan

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,640
[Pewds] I don't know what it is with children crying. It just feels good. You know, I don't know. Probably something wrong with me,

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,860
Poppy Harlow.  World Health Organization recently

62
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,720
classified gaming,

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,890
gaming disorder as an official condition and, a lot of people responded to this. &quot;That's just stupid,

64
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,840
This is just outrageous.&quot; But seeing how people react to not being allowed to play video games,

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,230
You kind of, you kind of get that. Maybe it is a problem.

66
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,430
I definitely used to be one of those squeaky little kids; when I wasn't allowed to play,

67
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,530
I would literally just sneak out to play anyway, and look where that got me. I mean- I'm Poppy.

68
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,730
I just- I was just thinking about someone  else. I know this is such a weird thing to think about

69
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,850
Maybe you're, you're, you're all 9 year olds as well. So it might be a bit in the future

70
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,530
But if you had kids, would you let them just freely play on the on the computer?

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,020
Because when I was a kid, that's what I wanted to do, and if my parents didn't allow me to do that

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,040
They were the assholes. &quot;When we asked our daughter what the problem was, she became unusually

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,940
argumentative and aggressive, which we just put down to her hormones (oh yeah). The parents said they limited their daughter's playtime

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,920
*Hmmmm* on the Xbox to one hour,&quot; Oh, she plays Xbox,

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,490
that's the problem. &quot;during school nights and two hours on a weekend

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:16,070
but the seriousness of the situation was was made apparent when her father found her sitting on a

77
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:25,180
urine-soaked cushion while playing the game,&quot; But did she win? You know if she's winning? I can sort of understand.

78
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,769
Especially you see twitch streamers (peepee) themselves all the time anyway

79
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,560
*CLAP CLAP*

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,630
The next news, everybody. Memes is going to die

81
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,919
Sorry, the next news.*Finna Dab* Memes is going to die everybody,

82
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,419
there's a new article in question called article 12, (article 13 you freaking liar go commit die xd) which is made to

83
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:50,340
Protect copyright for users on the Internet, but it could lead to the death of memes, everybody.

84
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,260
Oh, no. This has been talked about,

85
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,699
everywhere on every news or an article I've seen but very few youtubers aren't surprisingly talking about this

86
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,410
I think people are still so burned out on the net neutrality issue, that people are still like, &quot;Oh,

87
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,130
I can't, I can't be bothered with another issue.&quot;

88
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,180
Like, do you remember last time a law was introduced, that you felt,

89
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,789
Wow,

90
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:19,419
This actually helps me. This new idea that some politician introduced actually helped me actually,

91
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,880
benefited me. Wow.

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,350
The last thing I can think of is the fact that you can now use your cell phones, or your tablet's device, even

93
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,660
during takeoff and landing.

94
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,639
Which is so nice. That was the first time where they said that. I'm like wait a minute. They changed the law,

95
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,169
for the better?

96
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,720
For that- for my sake?

97
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,760
How did how did this happen? But yeah Metro is saying &quot;The EU could be about to ban memes and 'destroy the   internet'

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:54,280
Memes 'will be banned' under new EU copyright law, warn campaigners.&quot; &quot;Death to MEMES? EU copyright law could mean hilarious memes

99
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,169
disappear forever.&quot; Oh, not the hilarious memes, what am I gonna do without the E?

100
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,470
I really like the Metro article about this new, you know, I'm Poppy Harlow

101
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm not supposed to give my own opinion. But what am I gonna do instead of good old 2012 memes?

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,830
What am I gonna do with that success baby kid?

103
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,520
What am I gonna do without Rick Astley's &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; meme? &quot;The Copyright Directive is an attempt to

104
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,580
reshape copyright for the internet, in particular

105
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:32,260
rebalancing the relationship between copyright holders and online platforms. Article 13 states that platform providers should 'take measures

106
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:38,550
to ensure functioning of agreements conclude with the right holders for their use of their works'&quot;

107
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,080
So let's say I made a meme, and it gets distributed everywhere.

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,170
I can copy STRIKE other people and make money for that meme. You can still sort of do that.

109
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:54,090
I don't really see the point of this. I remember a few years ago. I actually got a copy

110
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,620
STRIKE from my lawyer.

111
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,960
It came through my lawyer. Sorry

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,450
It came through mail to my company, because I used one of those rage memes.

113
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,630
Apparently one of the person that made the rage meme,

114
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,450
was trying to cash in on it. And I think it was asking for less money than it would have cost for my lawyer,

115
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,360
So we just said (flip) him.

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,780
The thing is I understand what they're trying to do,

117
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:26,160
but clearly this is the idea of someone that doesn't understand the Internet. The Internet is all about sharing. It's all about reposting and

118
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,780
generally, no one seems to have a problem with that. And it's a certain ecosystem that's already in place and if you mess with that

119
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,950
idea, it's going to ruin a lot. What what's positive about the internet? A lot.

120
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,480
What's good about the Internet? This article will make it so that you can't remix songs, for example.

121
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,050
And these sort of things where fans put their own input on

122
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,530
material, that's what makes the original material more popular. That's how things get spread around

123
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:58,710
the Internet, It's a positive thing for everyone involved and there's really no reason to maintain that, or throw any,

124
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,090
branches in the machinery.

125
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,400
It's sort of the same, I think, as making Let's Plays completely illegal,

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,060
because they own copyright ownership of the game, which is, yes.

127
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,180
They technically do, but also they

128
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,810
benefit massively and pay Youtubers a lot of money to play their games because they know it's free

129
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,650
advertisement, and it's going to bring more attention to their game, and make it more successful.

130
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:30,140
So to mess with that system everyone, knows it's a bad idea, even though there are certain cases where these things do happen.

131
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,420
I would hate for YouTube or the internet in general, to turn into some sort of copyright competition.

132
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:43,400
YouTube is already adding a new tool that lets anyone copyright if anyone uses anyone- anything from you.

133
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,560
Let's say I use an image from someone else,

134
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,100
they can copyright that video, and take the revenue from, from that video. Great, great idea, great idea YouTube.

135
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,710
the thing is, I could claim so many videos myself, you know, I search 'PewDiePie' and there's millions of

136
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,340
views on videos that are compilations,

137
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,490
like this one of me saying (Nugget)

138
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:12,180
I could make money out of this, I could claim this video if I wanted to and it's just like, why, what's the point?

139
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,700
It's short-sighted and it's dumb. The voting of this I think will take place on the 20th,

140
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:26,460
so make sure you spread word around this. Share this video guys so we can stop this, because memes must  survive. I'm Poppy Harlow

141
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,550
Maybe the dab is a bit. How about a

142
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,150
How's that? It's that weird?

143
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,540
That's pretty cool. I like that one. Next news.

144
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,160
Let's talk about

145
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,700
video games, hurray.

146
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,070
I made my e3 video, but I didn't really get it-

147
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,310
I mean, sorry PewDiePie did his e3 video and he didn't really talk a lot about the games

148
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,340
so I'm going to do that instead, as

149
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:58,890
Poppy Harlow. This game called 'Ghosts of Tsushima' looks awesome.

150
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,310
I would love to play this game. [Character] *Whistle* Mitsubishi

151
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,660
[Pewds] For those who don't know, Ikou means let's go. I'm a level 4 Japanese nihongo, so

152
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,880
Just just so you know

153
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:28,400
[Characters] *Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo*

154
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,760
[Pewds] Very very exciting, but the here's the problem,

155
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:51,840
there's so many games that always look cool in the trailer. I remember this game 'Ryse: Son of Rome' the trailer looks so cool, right?

156
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
But then the game came out and it's like

157
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,480
*Sad trombone noises lmao*

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,540
Mediocre. Great. I'm glad I got so hyped for a garbage game

159
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:08,710
I'm never gonna play. Then we have Fallout 76 which is supposed to be an online game. Yay.

160
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,830
[Game] You must rebuild

161
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,800
Not just walls not just buildings but hearts, minds and

162
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,120
ultimately,

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,920
America itself.

164
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,420
[Pewds] Yay, (thats the same yay as before brad wtf) cause the Elder Scrolls online game was so epic, just lived up to the same hype as I had.

165
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,840
*sad trombone noises xdddd *

166
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,310
I wanna be hyped, but I feel like I'm just fooling myself. There's no point. I'll wait for the game,

167
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,930
I'll look at the reviews and then I'll make an assessment, okay. And you should do the same.

168
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,710
We finally got to see some gameplay of 'Death Stranding' which is a game

169
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm really really looking forward to. It looks aesthetic as hell, dawg. (my culture is not your sentence)

170
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,820
Hey, look it's a walking simulator everybody. I'm just kidding

171
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,460
I actually really look forward to playing even if it is a walking simulator just because it looks so immersive

172
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,120
oh non onon dont fall please sir

173
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,420
no drowning on this property

174
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,920
hecc

175
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,940
the bag noo

176
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,440
how did the bag come back

177
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,380
no dont fall again

178
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,410
Come on it looks cool. 'Last of Us 2' - of course

179
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,399
I'm also gonna play. A lot of people that seem actually mad about the kiss and

180
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm always like why, what's the big deal? Are you actually bothered by two girls kissing? Like what's the actual issue?

181
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,040
They kissed in the DLC

182
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,800
problemn't

183
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,960
demonitized

184
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:59,339
Okay, I'm gonna play devil's advocate here for a second okay from one perspective, I'm like it's a really sweet kiss

185
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,329
they already kissed in DLC. It shouldn't be that big of a deal it was made

186
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:09,540
so to contrast the darkness and gruesomeness of Ellie's character going from kissing to

187
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,269
really intense gory battles and stuff, right?

188
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:18,319
That's a point that you're given contrast more impactful trailer that way on the other side of the coin

189
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:25,350
I'm kind of like they really showed it in our faces, if they want to be playing the social justice card or whatever,

190
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,779
why can't you be more subtle with it? Can it just be without it being so in-your-face?

191
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,790
present or is it supposed to be that way to break the stigma?

192
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,559
I guess what I'm trying to say is should we break stigmas by shoving it into people's faces

193
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,259
or should we just

194
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:50,600
Let normal things that you want to be interpreted as normal, and no relationship that you want to be normal, just be normal

195
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,040
That doesn't have to be, &quot;Hey look at us

196
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,749
Huh, what do you think of this? Huh? Two girls kissing? Ha what do you think of this? Huh?&quot;

197
00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:01,139
And the same thing can go for the 'Battlefield 5' trailer

198
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,449
So many people are mad at this trailer, holy hell it's the worst-performing

199
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:11,670
Battlefield trailer of all time. Let's play devil's advocate because it's so much fun on one hand,

200
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,480
it's their take on world war, which is what they said

201
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,410
&quot;It's our take on world war 2&quot; They can really do whatever they want within certain limits

202
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,069
obviously, you look at games like 'Wolfenstein' and it's the Second World War but it obviously is

203
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:29,850
completely different. Battlefield isn't the most realistic game. You look at the

204
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,689
the glitches and how silly it is and how over the top it is

205
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:40,769
Why is it so crazy to people that a woman is kicking ass (brad come on) in the trailer now for the other side of the coin?

206
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:47,309
Battlefield has always been actual battles that actually happen at least in a lot of ways. That's how I see Battlefield.

207
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:53,339
You play these battles in these locations that actually happen by two different countries as far as I'm concerned,

208
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:59,149
British soldiers, female soldiers, didn't fight in the front line in World War 2

209
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,949
They just didn't. And in a lot of ways,

210
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:06,020
you're sort of bastardizing (brad!) the people that did die in World War 2 if you're making a game, if,

211
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,870
that is supposed to be World War 2, at least that's what Battlefield did, right, they recreate battles

212
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,690
It's not like Wolfenstein at all,

213
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,190
which in my opinion, is a completely different universe,

214
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,350
if you want to do that than, fine. But if you're gonna call it world war 2

215
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,590
and the way Battlefield has always done it  feels misplaced, now,

216
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:32,570
I don't think anyone actually has a problem with a woman in as the front figure of, of

217
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,890
Battlefield. I think the problem is that it's a British soldier, because we know there were soviet female soldiers that were badass (now im dissapointed in brad) in World

218
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:46,210
War 2 and there's some really interesting history there that you could actually I don't know if you want to lift that side up,

219
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,910
why not highlight that instead, why not highlight something that actually happened?

220
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,490
Which to me feels a lot more inspiring if you want to have that movement of yeah girls kick ass or whatever.

221
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,810
But obviously they can't lift up soviet to being something positive

222
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:04,420
It has to be in the brits or whatever, and it to me I watched it and it's just kind of cringe-worthy in my opinion.

223
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,080
There's to both sides of the coin and you can argue each one of them,

224
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,360
but ultimately I don't care some interesting stuff to discuss nonetheless. I am Poppy Harlow.

225
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,940
Oh that makes sense now.

226
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,180
Remember to leave a like on this video, I really appreciate it, and

227
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,940
Check out tomorrow's video.

228
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,020
Remember to hit the bell button *bing* and I'll see you guys

229
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:45,000
tomorrow.
