1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,169
posted k co yet this is actually come ask me about you do some people use for

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:09,040
the leader a kid is that all that's what Casey always talk about way he always

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,960
checking in i'm writing a light

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
ok i was at the camera take care

5
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:32,260
living in New York there are a lot of things that you you really take for

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,340
granted this morning specifically i'm thinking of a bacon egg and cheese

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,340
sandwich

8
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:51,410
let me get a let me get up

9
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,410
let me get a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:09,340
yeah

11
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,720
yeah

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,980
that sandwich wasn't actually that good they really overcooked the egg

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,240
that was a very very very quick day in the office it's 12:46 p.m.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,240
heading home

15
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,420
nice thank you do need this

16
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,780
that

17
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,780
time and i'll see you later

18
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,350
remember that horrible looking iphone case that I said was the ugliest thing

19
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,510
that Apple has ever made

20
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,160
we're going to think you're over sure let Casey this

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,160
thank you very much

22
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,260
and i'm just going to JFK I don't know how but actually I lost it

23
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,530
honestly I don't I have no idea how one uses it

24
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,120
any then i bought a second horribly ugly rubber iphone battery case

25
00:02:47,650 --> 00:03:06,609
I try not to lose this one these things are like a hundred bucks a pop you know

26
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:10,450
I really don't understand why Apple keeps making their phones thinner and

27
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,780
lighter and smaller but the batteries keep getting weaker and weaker

28
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,019
thank you very much to do you want to take care

29
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,859
it is ridiculous a cell phone so thin with the battery so small they then have

30
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,630
to buy a case that makes the phone thicker

31
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,090
so the battery will last longer

32
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,980
last thing I stat any is dat it's a fine phone

33
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,250
I just don't understand why they don't put greater priority on longer battery

34
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,180
life

35
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,590
look at that

36
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,489
it's really ugly ok it's Tuesday

37
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,489
let's do it

38
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,600
this is you name me on snapchat so I'm having people sending in their answers

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,630
it's it's crafting my snapchat feed their coming so quickly

40
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,330
do you follow me on snapchat and that this guy does follow me on sat here and

41
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,670
here's my thing

42
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,980
Casey miles from Israeli how much just social media plan to making a video go

43
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,669
viral

44
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:21,680
I think it's almost everything my first viral video went viral his people

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,430
literally emailed it to one another and i think if i had had the tools like

46
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,910
Twitter Facebook Instagram the social networks that we have today it would

47
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,950
have done a hundred times the viewership

48
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,300
I think the only way to make something go viral today is by leveraging social

49
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,300
media

50
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,660
what do I think social media will be in 10 years

51
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,610
Facebook will still be around I don't know about anyone else

52
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,860
well I think that's human beings we love connecting with other human beings and

53
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,410
real-world interaction is really hard

54
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,070
I look around right now I don't know a single person that's within my proximity

55
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,849
now look to social media and I see thousands and thousands of people that i

56
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:15,689
can connect with and that's a lovely feeling as humans we need that

57
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,529
connection

58
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:21,029
this is so hard to do because when i click on one to view it by the time it

59
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,939
loads it has been moved all the way down the list

60
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:26,939
snapchat chill out

61
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,099
you spend too much your life on social media

62
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:39,839
the only time i'm not on social medias when i'm asleep or when I'm in the

63
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,619
shower

64
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,860
I probably spend too much time on social media

65
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,770
what is your favorite social media

66
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,900
my favorite social media app number one is probably twitter if I spend most time

67
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,590
on twitter i really like snapchat

68
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,090
I love Instagram I love my own app had to pick which one this is my favorite

69
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,909
I so I don't know what makes inspiration on youtube

70
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,259
who's my biggest inspiration on youtube you guys are not gonna like the answer

71
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,319
to this question but it's probably pretty pie

72
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,000
I mean here's a guy starts with nothing he makes ridiculous videos that could

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,930
live anywhere else including anywhere else on the internet and he's like

74
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,919
thriving

75
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,520
he's like dominating the entire planet when it comes to video

76
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:34,289
I also think he's really funny and being funny is the hardest thing only

77
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,289
youtube definitely youtube

78
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:50,060
when I try to imagine my career without social media

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,710
it's tough it's really hard to imagine I don't know that I could imagine it and

80
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,010
you just the idea of releasing video releasing a movie without social media

81
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,510
it's not just the act of creating that I love so much at the conversation is the

82
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,620
docking forth

83
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,600
it's the feedback I get from the viewers in social media enables all of that some

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,100
people especially older people see the Sigma attached to social media

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
I don't think so I love social media

86
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:32,060
whoa whoa

87
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:41,900
in case you didn't have enough youtube swag
