just talked to the camera and it's a

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,690
very private conversation between me and

13
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,250
self-indulgent if you enjoyed this types

17
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,090
back but I want to just kind of update

18
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,320
you guys a little bit on my mental

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,630
health right now and why I haven't put a

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,450
video out for Sunday Monday why it might

21
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,250
be a very light week for video games are

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,719
for videos this week though I'll

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,570
probably stream most nights and my

24
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,680
heart's just not in it right now

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,289
if part of that is because I started a

26
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,870
new antidepressant which is helping but

27
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,280
you're in that I'm in that weird

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
transition phase I got a couple of

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,670
doctors appointments again this week

30
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,710
with the arm starting new physical

31
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,660
therapy with the arm trying to get that

32
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,870
back and going it's healing very well

33
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,710
part of it said I've crawled back into

34
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,090
some new video games been playing World

35
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,200
of Warcraft every night on stream

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,939
enjoying the new expansion crawled into

37
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,979
God of War again that's feeling really

38
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,860
good what an incredible game looking

39
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,030
forward a spider-man to coming out in a

40
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,450
couple of weeks as well but the events

41
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,700
in Jacksonville kind of took the wind

42
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,560
out of you here a little bit and I think

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,700
a lot of it's because it happened in the

44
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,320
gaming event and here's the thing bear

45
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,909
with me I'm not going to talk about the

46
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,549
politics here because I am not smart

47
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,960
enough to know anything about the

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,340
politics nor do I want to profit off of

49
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,780
this talking about this topic so

50
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,850
comments section is probably going to be

51
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,159
off d monetization is probably going to

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
be off feel free to discuss this with me

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,710
on Twitter or elsewhere but I have some

54
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,939
that I want to say in the last 24 hours

55
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,100
I've seen a lot of people blaming video

56
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,380
games video games make people aggressive

57
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,030
video games make people angry video

58
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,700
games make people do bad things this

59
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,530
happened in a madam event for the record

60
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,990
it's it's a football game you know but

61
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,930
regardless III don't see how football

62
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,909
would make you more aggressive more evil

63
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,580
more or any of those things but I've

64
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,289
seen a lot of people in my comments and

65
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,239
other places saying that this makes them

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,440
afraid to go to

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,060
ooh eSports tournaments it makes them

68
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,740
afraid to go to gaming events I think

69
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,330
that is a misconception and I think

70
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,500
mainstream media is definitely gonna

71
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,940
play that up I think some people are

72
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,530
gonna play that concept that the video

73
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,990
games - the problem I will tell you as

74
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,200
someone with a social anxiety disorder

75
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,180
who has great difficulty going into a

76
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,100
crowd I can't handle going to a bar I

77
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,980
can't handle going to a concert I still

78
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,050
go to a lot of gaming events though I go

79
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,670
to Friday Night Magic at my local gaming

80
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,190
store I go to some big end magic events

81
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,350
like Grand Prix's and stuff I've gone to

82
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,000
e3 which is one of the biggest events

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,100
there is I've gone to RTX very recently

84
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,010
which had 65,000 gamers and I've been

85
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,360
going to these events my whole life it's

86
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,690
the one place in the world I feel safe

87
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,830
in a crowd the reason for that is fairly

88
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,160
simple when we as nerds or gamers or

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,300
geeks or whatever you want to call

90
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,640
hobbyists enthusiasts when we go to

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,130
these events we go for three primary

92
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,890
reasons and they all have pretty much

93
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,950
one thing in common we go there out of

94
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,410
love for the thing that we're enjoying

95
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,239
it's the matter the gathering event

96
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,370
whether it's its its III whether it's a

97
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,959
huge gaming event whether it's

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,410
celebrating an anime or a board game or

99
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,550
whatever it is you're celebrating an

100
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,950
eSports event we go there for love of

101
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,590
the game we also go there to be with

102
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,450
other people who love the thing that we

103
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,170
love and we go there to celebrate that

104
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,310
hobby and thirdly when we especially at

105
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,140
eSports events we go there to celebrate

106
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,750
each other we go there to celebrate the

107
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,540
winners and the losers we participate in

108
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,430
these events we celebrate the team that

109
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,380
we play on we celebrate the team of one

110
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,940
if it's just ourselves and some of these

111
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,950
fighting game events or you know

112
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,459
shooting events when we go to when we go

113
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,709
to any of these things we go there to

114
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,880
celebrate each other gamers are some of

115
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,430
the most kind and loving and passionate

116
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,630
people nerds obvious enthusiasts I don't

117
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,780
think for a second that anyone is in any

118
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,299
extra danger at one of these events

119
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,789
because gamers are toxic because gamers

120
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,530
are brainwashed

121
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,680
gamers are

122
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,070
or bad people or sure some of us and

123
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,710
hurts some of us are weird some of us

124
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,810
are socially awkward some of us are on

125
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,789
the fringe of society some of us are

126
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,720
just broken sure sure but I've met those

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,280
people at the handful of concerts I've

128
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,900
gone to the handful of bars have gone to

129
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,229
the handful of VidCon and there's that

130
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,690
kind of person is at every event and I

131
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,039
don't think you're more or less likely

132
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,630
to meet that kind of person in the

133
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,320
gaming event and if you are they're

134
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
there to celebrate the game they're

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
there to celebrate the hobby and they're

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,699
there to celebrate each other now I'll

137
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,810
be the first to say that some of the

138
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,400
gaming events I've gone to certainly

139
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,620
could use some more security I'll you

140
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,720
know when we go to e3 and we wait in the

141
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,729
long long lines to have our bags checked

142
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,169
sometimes we complain and sometimes we

143
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:18,880
get frustrated hopefully moving forward

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,289
will complain a little less and be

145
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,780
little less frustrated knowing that the

146
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,210
risk and the danger is always there and

147
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,620
it always is no matter what you do even

148
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,970
if you're setting in your home that risk

149
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,330
and the danger is always there you know

150
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,740
but I hope that doesn't make you afraid

151
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,680
seven years of my life I once spent

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,840
shut-in to my home I was afraid to go

153
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,070
out into the world I was afraid to shop

154
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,900
for myself afraid to eat it restaurants

155
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,250
afraid to do anything else I was too fat

156
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,710
and too weird too broken and too too

157
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,630
much for the world to handle in the

158
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,930
world was too much for me dumbest

159
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,389
decision of my life

160
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,000
don't let the monsters keep you from

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
living your life and that's coming from

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,229
somebody with a social anxiety disorder

163
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,940
that's somebody coming with an anxiety

164
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,460
disorder if I'm not able if I'm able to

165
