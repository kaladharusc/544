1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,500
[Music]

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,020
so we just got back from the new horse

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,070
scary movie the darkest chapter in the

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,920
conjuring series the non

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,789
all righty then I always remember Ace

6
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,060
Ventura pet detective - all right

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,259
unfortunately I have to report to you

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,120
guys that the nun is a bit of a dud what

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,460
do you think yeah definitely it wasn't

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,949
all it wasn't that bad right it the

11
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,650
first but set pieces here 5 10 minutes

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,820
the first 5 to 10 minutes were really

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,199
really strong that was a much better

14
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,079
film yeah it shows you a little bit of

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,309
history back in 1952 or maybe even

16
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:57,100
before that a little intro 5-10 minutes

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,189
is the convent in this really creepy

18
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:05,019
area trying to hold back an evil that is

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,180
in the abbey and that is fascinating

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,159
it's interesting in the whole film is

21
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,689
supposed to be about that but I feel

22
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,340
like I missed that better film right

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,479
there yeah it spiraled out of control

24
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,110
then the demons started doing stuff and

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,909
kept showing up and then kept showing up

26
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:19,960
to the point where it stopped being

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,280
scary because you just expected the

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,020
demon to constantly show yeah in every

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,409
single scene and I like when they show

30
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,260
but you have to hold back some stuff and

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,110
at this point in 2018 you have to do

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,180
something with your horror films that

33
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,730
really scares your audience or does

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,860
something different this has all of the

35
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,840
jump scares which I have no problem with

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,490
jump scares as so as long as you set it

37
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,280
up with the correct suspension and an

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,610
intention intention I got a like an RSVP

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,560
letter for every jump scare it's like

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,270
will you be attending this one oh great

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,850
it's showing up in five seconds yeah

42
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,479
pretty much

43
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,760
and and some of them were spoiled in the

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,729
trailer yeah so yeah and it just kind of

45
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,769
gets wrong how do you mess up because I

46
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,190
think the concept is fascinating the non

47
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,819
painting in those other films is very

48
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,310
creepy I love where he's just staring at

49
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,099
the painting just kind of going into it

50
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,860
I had that Vigo kind of you know miss to

51
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,689
that but there's no painting in this it

52
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,939
has nothing to do that in fact we don't

53
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,530
even know why the painting exists it

54
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,020
talks about this painting but it never

55
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,640
comes into play you know you see a

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,970
picture of it in one

57
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,650
books like they find a book on

58
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,100
witchcraft the Duke that built the place

59
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,420
did and there's a picture of a nun it's

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,980
theater kind of like mock them and walk

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,690
amongst them but it's they didn't really

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,130
go into any detail that's what I wanted

63
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,440
I wanted more of the the lore that went

64
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
in like there were so many things that

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,480
were left unanswered

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,950
and I don't want to talk to spoil too

67
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,300
much about it but there was discipline

68
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,220
there was like some characters that they

69
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,630
started off really cool and I wanted to

70
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,250
know you know why are they here

71
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,990
I wanted to know like the backstory of

72
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,030
the castle the abbey and like the bad

73
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,830
guys and we got none of that the entire

74
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,730
time yeah it's they don't know how to

75
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,860
effectively use the scares that are in

76
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,290
the film people flying off into the

77
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,000
distance into the darkness it's not

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
really that scary somebody's screaming

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
in your face it's not really that scary

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,220
there was a lot to do a little bit

81
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,780
different things than that there was a

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,270
lot of like the demon would run his

83
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,650
fingers and like act like he was

84
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,180
grabbing but it just looked like he was

85
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,890
just putting his hands on a face I tell

86
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,800
you I'm giving you a face massage you

87
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,920
saw you're comfortable yet somebody feed

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,170
into a pillar or like snap your fingers

89
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,640
and then someone is literally buried

90
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,880
alive and there's no there was no reason

91
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,390
for it the film had a very odd pace and

92
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,970
structure just seemed seemed to be

93
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,769
willy-nilly just going anywhere

94
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,600
there were several moments where I just

95
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,570
completely disengaged and in the second

96
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,489
act but then it hooked me again was it

97
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,080
sad that I lost me you're like when

98
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,340
they're like oh we're gonna remind you

99
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,570
about the little side quest thing we

100
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,000
went on your condo yeah so the side

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,010
quest that was highly ineffective the

102
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,830
derail the film is the priest the priest

103
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,140
so those three main characters in the

104
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,540
film you've got the priest a younger nun

105
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,850
who has yet to take her vows who has

106
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,060
visions and then you have the Frenchie

107
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,210
it was the comedy relief of the film and

108
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,070
amongst these three characters the

109
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,870
character that felt the most pointless

110
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,600
was the priests absolutely and if it was

111
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,640
almost as if they felt like the need to

112
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,710
inject him in there for the Exorcist

113
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,110
purposes or something because they have

114
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,630
to live up to that or a pain which to

115
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,580
that in a Catholic or maybe if he had

116
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,740
the answers right if he had he had done

117
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,090
something that had been like really

118
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,340
effective but getting

119
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,540
from like starts n you just sit there

120
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,669
and go like he was just not necessary

121
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,850
nothing thankfully strong performances

122
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,169
come through from the none character as

123
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,790
who this this nun who is yet to take her

124
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,620
vows she is the audience we're

125
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,530
discovering this creepy Abbey and what's

126
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,720
what sucks is and why it's not a really

127
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,240
bad film is because it's shot

128
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,150
competently oh the atmosphere is perfect

129
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,850
it's referred this kind of movie but we

130
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,040
just get no no lore no no building of

131
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,250
the tension and the actual scary moments

132
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,120
feel more like a superhero film or a

133
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,550
zombie thriller then then the

134
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,090
supernatural God versus the save God

135
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,030
versus Satan and this everlasting battle

136
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,639
and stuff and it gets a little what

137
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,830
happens almost is it becomes almost a

138
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,620
parody of itself yeah in a third act it

139
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,940
got kind of funny I mean in the

140
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,199
beginning there was some really strong

141
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,470
symbols as the the bad thing is walking

142
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,539
down the hallways the crucifixes are

143
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,430
turning upside down and voting the

144
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,020
hallway that was great and then like

145
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,700
handles are going out or coming back in

146
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,110
and shadows were doing things and then

147
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,160
at the end of the movie none of that

148
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,720
happened you just see this kind of CG

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,870
face scream a bunch right right and and

150
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,479
you know kind of uh it is so that's why

151
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,250
it was disappointing it's an uneven film

152
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,590
there are great set pieces there's a set

153
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,389
piece you know when well we'll talk

154
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,580
about that in the spoilers but I have to

155
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,490
basically just some sum it up as great

156
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,240
performances competently shot good

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,380
atmosphere the music was a you know

158
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,229
pretty good but very loud and and it was

159
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,389
almost up to the music to make up for

160
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,030
the lack of actual scares in the field

161
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,130
other than the jump scares to really

162
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,930
hold a film so that's why you know the

163
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,820
the music was effective but a little

164
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,160
overdone the music was good but it also

165
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,080
helped Telegraph when things were gonna

166
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,060
happen and so they're they're due to

167
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,470
they did a good job like building

168
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,669
tension in certain scenes you know

169
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:52,720
something's gonna happen but you're not

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,639
sure when and then all of a sudden you

171
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,260
know the string section goes nuts before

172
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,690
it happens you okay guess jump-scare

173
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,560
and yep

174
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,850
there was the jump scare you also have

175
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,320
the problem of it feeling a little

176
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,270
pointless because you kind of know

177
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,090
what's you kind of know well this is a

178
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,340
conjuring spinoff and we have seen the

179
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,260
nun and the other conjuring films like

180
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,630
teased her multiple times and so

181
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,090
obviously she's not done and over with

182
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,460
so you know she's a there's gonna find a

183
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,910
way to continue it and the way they did

184
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,050
is a little disappointing but but but

185
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,490
like I said the priest character kind of

186
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,040
derailed the second act with the subplot

187
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,229
of you know this little boy then he did

188
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,139
an exorcism on and previously and they

189
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,930
it just felt like another way to throw

190
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,380
in some more jump scares and ultimately

191
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,910
that's that was the point of that

192
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,650
plotline hey one of those little boy

193
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,660
jump scares to get me I am there was two

194
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,820
two or two of them got me alright so

195
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,050
let's go ahead and give our final

196
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,750
verdict which is good because look this

197
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,450
week you don't have to see the nun you

198
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,130
can wait on that one but maybe

199
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,380
eventually do see it if you're into the

200
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,690
conjuring series it's not as good as the

201
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,090
conjuring one or conjuring to Annabelle

202
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,830
films I checked out and I don't want to

203
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,150
watch those it might be better knows

204
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,310
yeah I know I thought that the the last

205
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,990
Annabelle one that we saw together was

206
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,180
better oh yeah that's right Annabelle

207
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,060
creationary creation yeah so let's give

208
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,380
a final verdict what would you give this

209
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,140
film Alex I'm gonna give this one a five

210
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,870
and this movie feels really average and

211
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,090
it's a five with an asterisk and you

212
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,710
have to kind of like horror movies and

213
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,150
so you're gonna appreciate some things

214
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,100
like they did a good job with the acting

215
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,560
I feel they really wasted that this is a

216
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,289
rated R film had I guess did this feel

217
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,610
like I read it on yeah I didn't feel

218
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,039
there was it wasn't really gory there

219
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,320
wasn't the only gore that was in it had

220
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,750
nothing to do with the demon this is

221
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,580
weird is the kind of a nun kind of dated

222
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,520
to herself and she's just decomposing

223
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,339
that's the only yeah job yeah it turned

224
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,040
it kind of like a zombie movie where you

225
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,020
find out that all look like that these

226
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,990
bad demon things can just be hit with

227
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,390
shovels and they kind of cleaned up

228
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,010
everything kind of nicely and I didn't

229
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,660
appreciate that yeah so I wanted more

230
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,709
from this movie especially if it was

231
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,050
rated R so give it a five yeah and I

232
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,670
agree with that I want to give it a five

233
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,520
out of ten

234
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,470
the final verdict it claims to be the

235
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,050
darkest chapter in the conjuring no no

236
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,230
pantheon but actually it's almost the

237
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,750
funniest they really do really push the

238
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,880
humor with Franchi friend she has so

239
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,340
many moments of humor in the film that I

240
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,230
could tell it was sort of breathing

241
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,630
moments for the audience because maybe

242
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,790
the director or the studio felt like it

243
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,910
was getting a little bit too much and I

244
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,280
wish it stayed on that path I wish it

245
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,080
went much darker and I wish it went with

246
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,860
a completely brutal ending but it didn't

247
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,720
do any of those things so if you'd like

248
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,820
to you know save your money definitely

249
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,040
save your money spend it on spider-man

250
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,210

rating so no reason to go to the movies

guys

266
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,650
welcome to the spoiler section so

267
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,780
another problem with the film and where

268
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,250
I said it was like willy-nilly is

269
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,140
throwing everything in and it kind of

270
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,680
really is man this this you didn't need

271
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,620
to like show some of the flashback

272
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,400
scenes of world war two bombings and

273
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,230
it's so this film had World War two

274
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,660
bombings it had the blood of Jesus

275
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,690
Christ it had super relics it had the

276
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,560
tectonic nights the you know these and

277
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,170
and these nights you you know hacking

278
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,320
demon kind of things and or no a guy a

279
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,910
lord who was trying to resurrect valack

280
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,300
is the demon's name so the nun isn't a

281
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,110
nun it's a demon in disguise as a nun

282
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,390
and all of what what he was describing

283
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,890
happened at about ten seconds yeah

284
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,110
that's the problem it happened about ten

285
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,910
seconds and so the other things are

286
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,790
focusing on just wasn't as satisfying

287
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,890
but what happened seems like a crazy

288
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,290
film I would like kind of questionable

289
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,360
happiness they gave us nothing like we

290
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,210
don't know it was a big deal it was

291
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,070
supposed to be a big deal that this is

292
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,480
unlike a novice or she's a pre nun and

293
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,770
the pre nun gets sent on this mission

294
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,810
and they kind of make it out to be

295
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,430
something secret like the Vatican knows

296
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,350
what she's going and there's some

297
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,220
clerical error but they they never get

298
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,360
flush anything you know and so what

299
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,490
happens is there's like a flashback

300
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,430
scene within a vision because all the

301
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,810
nuns are actually dead there are no nuns

302
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,600
in this movie other than the pre nun

303
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,100
yeah all the nuns are dead

304
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,720
I mean it's so stupid cuz like you would

305
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,340
have left right away oh they had the

306
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,840
beginning when the truth that when the

307
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,110
priest is he gets called out or he's

308
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,240
following what is he following he's

309
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,590
following the little boy that he

310
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,480
exercised oh yeah out into the graveyard

311
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,630
and then the demon you know uses the

312
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,360
little boy as a way to confuse him and

313
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,310
catch him off guard yells in his face

314
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,830
falls backward falls into his grave all

315
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,710
of a sudden the the ground is perfect

316
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,600
that was the first moment it was it was

317
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,590
comical because the demon boy

318
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,930
at the priest priest falls backwards and

319
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,210
then all of a sudden that they should

320
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,180
make soom in on the tombstone which says

321
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,990
like here lives father so insane

322
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,730
yeah it was completely and totally

323
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,440
unnecessary and that's something that a

324
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,170
problem with the entire movie is the the

325
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,120
demon can knock you back really far the

326
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,350
demon has the magic to create this

327
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,779
tombstone and like snap its fingers and

328
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,010
now you're in a coffin that's six feet

329
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,050
under the ground and then make your face

330
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,520
really uncomfortable because of this

331
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,380
just give you a light massage yeah like

332
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,940
in the coffin like the demon starts like

333
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,470
playing with his face and he's freaking

334
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,230
out but we see over the course of the

335
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,279
rest of the movie like the demon can

336
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,779
just do like ridiculously powerful

337
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,970
things like lift one person up while

338
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,410
knocking using magic to knock you

339
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,750
against the wall and it was kind of

340
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,880
silly in those you know I'll forgive a

341
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,130
few of those in these types of movies

342
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,450
because it's like oh maybe they're not

343
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,040
maybe the demon isn't powerful enough

344
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,529
until the moment of confrontation and

345
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,690
this and that but this happens so often

346
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,480
that's the problem there and that's one

347
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,130
example there's a bunch of other

348
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,650
examples where at a certain point your

349
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,630
suspension of disbelief is broken in

350
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,339
your leg okay this is just just like a

351
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,760
straight up you know demon romp rather

352
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,080
than a supernatural you know whore and

353
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,060
it got kind of silly then with like in

354
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,920
the third act there in the catacombs and

355
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,510
they're trying to seal this thing in and

356
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,339
that the first opportunity for them just

357
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,620
to completely split up and just get yeah

358
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,170
it's like wait why randomly they split

359
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,430
up when they know okay

360
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,790
God ends here the God does not go past

361
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,950
this point we have the blood of Jesus

362
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,720
Christ which by the way they find the

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,550
Christmas arise in a Christmas ornament

364
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,390
and they go into this the gates of hell

365
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,880
or not we I mean there's some kind of

366
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,910
gateway that they need to find and the

367
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,410
first thing they do is split up oh

368
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,540
because I want to look a little further

369
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,700
down this hallway and the other people

370
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,670
don't think to stop and you bullshit and

371
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,130
then the demon takes the form of like

372
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,870
eight nuns which is cool and then it

373
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,640
kind of turns in did you get a Silent

374
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,400
Hill feel no no so that that was wrong

375
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,650
that was one of my favorite scenes so

376
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,260
what I was losing it and then it grabbed

377
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,720
me again when she there's an area in the

378
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,790
beware there's none that's supposed to

379
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,199
be praying at all times

380
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,759
oh yes the thing is there's a fucking

381
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,470
demon here and there's a gateway to hell

382
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,899
and it's trying to come through and so

383
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,040
somebody has to be praying I was like oh

384
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,230
my god this is fantastic I wish the film

385
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,480
would concentrate on this and then all

386
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,509
of a sudden you know a big troop of nuns

387
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:20,839
come and they they're all like chanting

388
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,220
and stuffing oh man this is fucking

389
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,199
crazy this is great and then they like

390
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,910
it she's like dude you need to pray with

391
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,410
us you know the white nun who hasn't

392
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,449
taken over but and so you're praying

393
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,339
oh holy shit and then like stuff starts

394
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,589
to happen you know okay this is fucking

395
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,689
tight but it turns out that you know

396
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,310
that was all the visions a vision I

397
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,019
wasn't there no there would have been

398
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,720
much better if that was a part of the

399
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,279
film and we got to know some of these

400
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,680
some of these nuns and we had little

401
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,720
scary moments with each of these nuns

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,759
with their own experience with the demon

403
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,920
and maybe their their fears and stuff

404
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,930
like that but it's just a small little

405
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,579
scene used a great set piece but just

406
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,089
you know a little flash of greatness no

407
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,079
I was talking about the nuns of the

408
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,139
catacomb that they have all black black

409
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,389
faces and so he takes the he takes the

410
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,769
form of all of these nuns and then he

411
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,689
takes the form of what feels like Silent

412
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,399
Hill nurses where they're kind of like

413
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,019
sitting there and like a weird pose and

414
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,209
their necks keep zombies as they keep

415
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,759
moving and cracking and things like that

416
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,550
and then he's also another nun and then

417
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,970
he becomes he takes complete infests

418
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,160
somebody but also as a nun at the same

419
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,610
time plus all of the other 40 nuns the

420
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,680
hell sucks all of them back to hell but

421
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,629
because he's already partially in one

422
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,699
person yeah that so even though you see

423
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,500
the nun died because they spit the blood

424
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,779
of Jesus all over its face but the nun

425
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,269
is still inside of you as there's an

426
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,189
upside down cross burnt in the guys back

427
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:51,139
of the neck friend she ends up being

428
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,899
possessed and then they say 25 years

429
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,000
later or whatever and that's the scene

430
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,129
when the war ends who were much better

431
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,629
and you're like man I wish the Warrens

432
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,610
in this or show up and they try to

433
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,589
exorcise them but then it just ends yeah

434
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,110
nothing even cool happens in that scene

435
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,149
either where they're trying to set set

436
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:09,530
up connect it with the rest of the

437
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,950
franchise and there

438
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,200
is the key thing the inconsistency like

439
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,990
like these Knights used the blood of

440
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,250
Jesus Christ which is like the most

441
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,680
holiest of holy that was one funny joke

442
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,260
it was like holy shit the holiest of

443
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,970
shit is like the priest is like the

444
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,900
holiest yes my son the holy is the blood

445
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,510
of Jesus Christ you know and they use it

446
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,490
to prevent the demon from coming through

447
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,760
with this evil Lord Duke or whatever

448
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,890
that was trying to summon a demon and

449
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,680
and they prevent it and it should close

450
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,510
up that's a blood of Jesus Christ that's

451
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,030
it there's no more shit happening here

452
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,530
okay there's gonna be the holiest place

453
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,860
ever but no a few or two bombs managed

454
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,380
to like I don't know open up the whole

455
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,640
that makes no sense

456
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,860
yeah so especially it didn't even wasn't

457
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,690
a direct hit on the bonds of on just hit

458
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,920
way over there somewhere

459
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,260
it's so stupid so all these different

460
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,720
inconsistencies add up to make it like

461
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,790
ridiculous you're going in 15 different

462
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,540
directions focus you you you you play

463
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,880
homage to The Exorcist here and there

464
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,060
but you you didn't notice that that film

465
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,450
is very focused and the rules are laid

466
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,850
out there are rules and when you don't

467
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,860
have rules in this film then you

468
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,810
everything's just willy-nilly and it's

469
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,420
just a popcorn and it makes me mad

470
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,810
because this concept is the creepiest to

471
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,350
me nuns and Catholic stuff and their

472
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,600
children and a war between Satan and

473
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,660
Jesus and and God is that shit is crazy

474
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,460
man and you could get some good stuff

475
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,290
out of it one of the best holders of all

476
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,470
