1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,770
what's up ladies and gentlemen of

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,689
YouTube boogie2988 community lavas get

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,190
to the power of the Internet and today I

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,540
want to talk to you a little bit about

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,330
youtuber burnout which is a topic that's

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,620
been in the media now for a couple of

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,210
months but let me start off by saying

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,070
I'm not talking about myself in this

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,350
video I'm not personally burnout I'm

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,940
actually very energized right now I'm

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,920
really enjoying doing YouTube I'm really

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,180
enjoying doing twitch I'm really

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,130
enjoying what I've been doing and it

14
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,050
that's a bit of a turnaround I have been

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,390
burnout before but definitely not right

16
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,750
now

17
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,240
but we've been seeing some pretty famous

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,430
youtubers Elle Mills is the one I'm

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,010
featuring here but we've also seen

20
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,350
jacksepticeye Bobby burns Casey nice

21
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,239
that Felix we've seen plenty of

22
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,739
youtubers talk about this stuff in the

23
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,629
last year and if you do a Google News

24
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,280
search you're gonna see that this is a

25
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,980
very popular topic for the media to talk

26
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,770
about it's going pretty much mainstream

27
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,969
everyone's talking about YouTube burnout

28
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,920
so I thought I'd throw in my two cents

29
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,539
but I want to start off by addressing

30
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,730
the elephant in the room a lot of people

31
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,379
who are doing YouTube for a living are

32
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,539
living their dreams their dream jobs

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,070
they wanted to be filmmakers they want

34
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,359
to be entertainers they wanted to be

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,769
famous and they wanted to make money

36
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,630
doing it and now they are doing that and

37
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,939
I think almost every YouTube creator has

38
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,460
felt a tremendous guilt complaining

39
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,100
about the aspects of that life of that

40
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,049
job because we often know that the

41
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,159
audience has difficulty understanding

42
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,439
that but I'll remind everybody of the

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,780
very old adage be careful what you wish

44
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,270
for because you just might get it and it

45
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,680
may not be what you wanted and it may

46
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
not be what you needed and sometimes

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
almost always there's a catch and I

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,170
think a lot of people equate this

49
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,869
problem to money you got to keep in mind

50
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,520
not every youtuber is rich and a lot of

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,619
youtubers are still working paycheck to

52
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,060
paycheck but those who aren't and

53
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,040
they've eliminated money as a problem a

54
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,180
lot of the youtubers somewhere to talk

55
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,280
about today have eliminated money has a

56
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,350
problem if you know anything about life

57
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,850
by now you know that when you eliminate

58
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,740
one problem four or five other problems

59
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,899
crop up in its place that said I could

60
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,490
not be more grateful for the money I

61
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,649
made knowing that if I get sick I can go

62
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,750
to the doctor if I need help if I need

63
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,700
to help somebody else I can do it I know

64
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,439
the mortgage is gonna be paid the

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,909
electricity is always going to be on and

66
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,189
I'm gonna be taken care of it's really

67
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,140
nice it's really really it's a load off

68
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,869
for sure but going back to El Mills she

69
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,129
said something that really struck me

70
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,569
that I think is really interesting and

71
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,770
if you haven't seen her video on the top

72
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,420
like I highly recommended it's called a

73
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,820
burnout at 19 and I think you'll really

74
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,230
enjoy the video give it a search here on

75
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,700
YouTube and watch it if you get a chance

76
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,520
that video shows a young girl in a very

77
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
raw state very agitated very frustrated

78
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,500
very depressed very anxious I've never

79
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,690
seen anything like it on YouTube I have

80
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,640
a fairly transparent here on YouTube and

81
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,140
I've never thought to film myself in

82
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,970
that state and I'm so proud that she did

83
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,950
but l Mills expressed a point that I

84
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,330
think a lot of youtubers feel we feel

85
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,490
kind of enslaved by the YouTube

86
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,350
algorithm knowing that sometimes if we

87
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,300
take a month off or even sometimes just

88
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,940
a week off we don't create content every

89
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,920
day or every week or at least a couple

90
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,630
of times a month that the YouTube

91
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,280
algorithm will definitely become

92
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,660
frustrated and if we don't create our

93
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,610
best content as frequently as I can our

94
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,380
audience can become frustrated and that

95
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,150
tips off the algorithm that we're no

96
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,860
longer creating good content so the

97
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,810
entire thing can fall like a house of

98
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,700
cards or like a stack of dominoes and

99
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,080
it's it's really scary and I think

100
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,370
that's the biggest part of the pressure

101
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,350
that L was feeling l Mills said I

102
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,000
definitely was feeling drained because I

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,530
was trying to pump out an amazing video

104
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,230
once every two weeks or like once every

105
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,610
week that's just not attainable

106
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,380
especially with the hours that goes into

107
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,940
each video make sure there's plenty of

108
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,800
youtubers like me who set down in a day

109
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,110
we have a script idea in our head we

110
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,060
film for like an hour hour and a half we

111
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,890
edit for another hour then we publish it

112
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,020
and put it out into the world and and so

113
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,459
it's a fairly easy turnaround but if you

114
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,440
look at what youtubers like shears doing

115
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,330
my god the amount of effort she was

116
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,350
putting into the videos like when she

117
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,140
tried to lift her childhood home up by

118
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,630
balloons I mean come on and then you get

119
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,910
into the cycle where every video needs

120
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,459
to be better or at least as good as the

121
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,810
last one so the more effort you put in

122
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,280
the more effort you have to put in

123
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,990
moving forward and then in the case of

124
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,490
this young lady not only was she doing

125
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,530
like brand deals not only was she doing

126
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,630
appearances she was touring to meet her

127
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,030
fans on top of filming I can't imagine

128
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,610
she was probably pulling 70 80 90 hour

129
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,740
work weeks with travel in between the

130
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,050
works I can't I can't imagine of course

131
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,550
she got burned out of course she got

132
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,350
burned out but even for youtubers who

133
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,520
were creating content that might be a

134
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,140
little less difficult to create than

135
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,120
what L was creating let's take

136
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,250
jacksepticeye for example it can be

137
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,040
fairly crushing still and last month we

138
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,380
saw Jack talk about the stuff and I want

139
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,030
to talk about Jack a little bit now in

140
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,040
Jack's video he basically said that the

141
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,100
pressure of creating the

142
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,800
same content over and over every day was

143
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,570
getting to him and that he just needed a

144
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,860
break from it and he knew that that

145
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,150
might have said his audience it might

146
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,590
upset the YouTube algorithm but it was a

147
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,840
risk he was willing to take in Jack's

148
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
video he said my mental health has not

149
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,380
been in the best place recently so the

150
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,820
reason I've been taking more time office

151
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,560
because I have to I need to take the

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,120
time off to get my brain back in order

153
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,740
to just get that energy and that

154
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,540
motivation back to record the videos I

155
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,340
could have forced myself through it to

156
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,780
try and make videos from when it's done

157
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,760
but it's just not worth it I know what

158
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,530
you're thinking jack is in a position

159
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,810
where he can afford financially to take

160
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,730
that time off and when it comes to his

161
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,230
stardom people are not gonna forget the

162
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,420
jacksepticeye exists if he takes a month

163
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,460
off to take a vacation to skip a

164
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,590
paycheck when he comes back his audience

165
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,240
is going to be so excited they're back

166
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,950
Jack is in a very privileged position

167
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,320
where he can do that just like when I

168
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,820
was working paycheck to paycheck and

169
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,440
just like you are probably working from

170
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,300
paycheck to paycheck now when we get

171
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,220
burnout not everybody can do that and

172
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,230
that's true for a lot of youtubers who

173
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,030
are still living paycheck to paycheck

174
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,800
they count on that month's YouTube check

175
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,900
to pay the rent to pay the electricity

176
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,310
to pay the internet bill that allows

177
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,080
them to upload to begin with and there's

178
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,700
people who are stuck in a stage for two

179
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,890
three five ten years of their career who

180
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,620
may never break out of that you can

181
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,790
imagine the pressure they're dealing

182
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,770
with Jack also said there's times when I

183
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,540
don't leave my house for the last two

184
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,650
weeks I don't think I've left my house

185
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,840
at all to go do anything I don't really

186
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,370
like doing that and it gets to you after

187
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,620
a while doing the same video over and

188
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,420
over again kind of weighs you down

189
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,010
really hits on something here that I

190
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,480
think a lot of people don't realize is

191
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,530
that when you're working a nine-to-five

192
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,110
job when you get off at 5:30 6 o'clock

193
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,880
maybe you check a few emails in a night

194
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,620
but you're pretty much done for the day

195
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,390
especially if you're working menial

196
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,190
labor like I did with washing dishes or

197
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,660
work in security up of the hyper

198
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,160
building here at the University when you

199
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,990
go home for work chances are the rest of

200
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,820
the day belongs to you you might have a

201
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,230
family you might have kids that you're

202
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,550
worrying about but for the most part you

203
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,720
probably get a little bit of time to

204
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,760
focus on that part of your life but when

205
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,230
you're your own boss when your own

206
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,240
creator when you run your small business

207
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,700
it can consume you from the moment you

208
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,040
wake up to the moment you go to bed you

209
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,770
do nothing but eat sleep and breathe and

210
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,500
drink the thing that you are doing and I

211
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,060
think that becomes true for a lot of

212
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,919
successful youtubers you strike why

213
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,660
there aren't hot and the iron is hot now

214
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,150
so you're going to go without sleep you

215
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,990
go without it

216
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,760
you go without any self-care so you can

217
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,070
focus on doing the job pleasing the

218
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,420
people who watch you and making the

219
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,430
money while you can I have felt that

220
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,260
pressure so much that even when I was

221
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,730
recovering from a gastric bypass surgery

222
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,130
I was afraid to not have videos to go

223
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,540
live on the channel I was afraid to not

224
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,610
create new videos I created a video 5

225
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,280
days after the surgery and even when I

226
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,780
was going through my divorce I was still

227
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,310
uploading three or four nights a week

228
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,050
streaming three or four nights a week I

229
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,700
wasn't even willing to take the time to

230
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,340
self-care during my divorce because I'm

231
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,860
so focused on this job and it's true for

232
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,930
most youtubers who were successful all

233
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,490
of this though reminds me of a story

234
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,930
that I've been wanting to tell her on

235
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,430
YouTube for awhile when I first arted

236
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,900
doing web design I met a fellow

237
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,880
webmaster who was very very successful

238
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,100
designed a website that made him about a

239
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,800
million dollars in his first year in

240
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,090
business and him and I used to work

241
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,200
together all the time we would talk

242
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
about stuff all the time he tried to

243
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,280
help me out all the time and then just

244
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,930
one day I noticed he didn't log back

245
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,880
into the chat program we used for like a

246
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,380
few months and I never knew what

247
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,030
happened to him when he finally did log

248
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,830
back in I asked him what happened and he

249
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,840
said that he had had a heart attack at

250
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,250
the age of 24 he had been working

251
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,410
20-hour weeks he'd been abusing a

252
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,990
caffeine to try to stay awake so that he

253
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,940
can continue to work to strike while the

254
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,800
iron is hard to make as much money as he

255
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,680
could as quickly as he could and he

256
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,510
didn't have health insurance so he ended

257
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,280
up spending the mass majority of the

258
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,800
money he'd made just trying to stay

259
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
alive and then on top of that his

260
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,280
websites all went offline but he was too

261
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,690
sick in the hospital to take care of

262
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,760
himself and pretty much everything he'd

263
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,530
built had crumbled within a year and

264
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,700
there's a lesson that I learned from

265
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,350
that that I still employ in my life to

266
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,300
this day that I think every youtuber or

267
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,220
everybody out there working two jobs or

268
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,570
everybody who's breaking their back to

269
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,670
put bread on the table for their family

270
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,840
can learn and I want to share that

271
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,270
lesson with you now you never know when

272
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,440
you're gonna die you never know when

273
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,550
you're gonna get sick you never know

274
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,900
when you're gonna get fired you never

275
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,880
know when everything you are building

276
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,100
will crumble that very well could happen

277
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,770
tomorrow but it also happened 10 15 20

278
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,990
years down the road from now too because

279
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,700
you never know what is going to happen

280
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,140
or how it's going to happen you have to

281
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,240
make sure that every single day counts

282
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,370
and that means even on your busiest days

283
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,170
you need to take a couple of hours out

284
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,480
to enjoy the stuff that you enjoy maybe

285
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,890
it's video games maybe it's a movie

286
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,270
maybe it's a TV show maybe it's taking

287
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,010
your dog for a walk getting some ex

288
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,440
sighs doing something like that and if

289
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,420
the job that you do every day is

290
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,620
something that you enjoy

291
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,750
you should probably still find something

292
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,030
outside of that to do so you don't get

293
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,920
burnout I also do something I think a

294
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,240
lot of people can't afford to do but I

295
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,910
pick one day a week and that Saturday to

296
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,410
spend with my friends to spend with my

297
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,780
family to focus on things that only I

298
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,670
enjoy I don't worry about the job I

299
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,750
don't worry about the business I don't

300
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,060
check email I don't answer phone calls I

301
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,550
don't check social media I just let that

302
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,040
day be about me and sometimes I do it

303
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
just here in my house and play video

304
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,410
games and invite my friends here

305
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,760
sometimes to go to my local gaming store

306
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,890
sometimes I travel but it tries to spend

307
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,380
at least one day a week focused on

308
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,750
self-care and I think everyone should be

309
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,280
doing that but I personally am really

310
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,360
grateful that a lot of other youtubers

311
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,980
are starting to talk about this they're

312
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,060
starting to talk about mental health

313
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,830
they're starting to talk about the

314
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,840
difficulties of this job and it seems

315
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,100
like the audiences are finally starting

316
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,690
to come around a lot of the times when

317
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,920
people talked about the stuff a few

318
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,810
years ago you'd see a lot of pushback on

319
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,030
like exclusively pushback now you're

320
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,320
starting to see a lot of audience

321
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,990
members understand and relate and get it

322
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,970
and I think it's because so many these

323
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,500
youtubers are so incredible so

324
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,390
charismatic and they do a much better

325
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,370
job of explaining it than I ever could

326
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,780
but I'm really really grateful but I'm

327
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,280
curious as to what you think do you

328
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,630
think Jack and the hell and these other

329
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,610
creators including myself are just

330
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,800
idiots for for not loving what we're

331
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,540
doing do you guys understand the burnout

332
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,250
do you understand the stress let me know

333
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,990
in the comment section below but a long

334
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,430
time ago when I was studying to be a

335
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,680
therapist a psychologist and could you

336
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,080
imagine they were trying to teach me a

337
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,030
very important lesson and they said when

338
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,590
you're dealing with someone who may have

339
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,680
been beaten or tortured or hurt in very

340
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,420
bad ways and you're dealing with that

341
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,770
patient for your one o'clock appointment

342
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,200
and then your 2:30 appointment comes in

343
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,660
and it's a rich lady who lives a life of

344
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,730
privilege who's upset because her and

345
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,320
her husband aren't having as good as sex

346
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,510
as they would like how do you relate to

347
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,610
that person how do you understand that

348
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,230
person after dealing with somebody who's

349
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,690
suicidal just an hour before the answer

350
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,910
to that question is empathy and relative

351
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,680
pain you have to understand that this

352
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,840
privileged young lady who's lived a life

353
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,740
of luxury her worst day is her worst day

354
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,450
to her and even if her worst day is

355
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,210
objectively better than my worst day it

356
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,770
doesn't really matter because it's still

357
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,840
her worst day

358
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,670
and it would be my job as a therapist to

359
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,230
help her through it and I hope that you

360
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,700
can understand it might be your job as

361
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,830
an audience member to help Jack through

362
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,050
his but just let me say you guys have

363
