2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,150

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,890

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,890

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,920
picture for um this is just for herself

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,850
I don't understand what you want me to do right

8
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,760
don't you switch to light bulbs but you're not going to get that out I felt

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,830
like it was gonna break in my hand I can you know

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:05,290

11
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,350

12
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:22,570

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,920
just to make out for that shot

16
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,060
we interrupt our programming to bring you this important message

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,550
actually this is not a super important message but i do need your help

18
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,510
i was nominated for a youtuber of the year award at the shorty awards

19
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,280
and I need your vote for me the link is below top link

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,200
it's not that I care about winning it's just that I hate lose it

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,810
so please I asked if you go below it takes like I don't know how long it

22
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,530
takes

23
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,810
take me for youtuber of the year now back to our normally scheduled blog

24
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,930
I don't know how long this has been down here but I can think of a lot of places

25
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,639
more appropriate to store a DVD recorder then under a radiator

26
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,760
this is what happens plumbing pipe

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,530
these are flanges my favorite thing to make desks out of it

28
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,920
the entire board area needs to be relocated

29
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,120
that's going to go in the back where the rest of the stuff is going to go

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
this is for work that is for stuff

31
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,640
a lot of work to do a lot of work to do but it's tuesday and consistency is

32
00:03:49,640 --> 00:04:06,410
everything we are wondering what are going to take friends seem to get 0

33
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,519
I'm actually really looking forward to taking the kids to disney world but she

34
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,209
like can go to the grocery store now without freaking out so I don't know

35
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:14,870
what she's like

36
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,859
three how 43 something great question guys

37
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,250
kk see this is a random question but are you a good dancer

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,470
I don't think that question random at all and the answer is no my grandmother

39
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,139
was a Rockette on Broadway a like fabulous super star dancer she taught

40
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,729
dance her entire life

41
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,830
I took lessons from her for seven years i never got past the baby class

42
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,740
that's a two-year-old the five-year-old's the kids kept growing up

43
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,389
I stayed in the same class

44
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,889
I can do a time step though this is as good as I got time step

45
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,889
let's see is no turn step 2

46
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,880
i can edit video like nobody's business but I don't have an out of rhythm in my

47
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,860
entire body

48
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,889
you ever think about moving to San Francisco

49
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,539
you know I spend a lot of time in san francisco for for work but I don't think

50
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:12,020
I could live there at least not now this point in my life I couldn't live there

51
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,710
it's an amazing city though my questions about music clearances

52
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,520
what are you doing with that you got the Frank Sinatra still up on your skiing

53
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,210
video

54
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,479
how do you monetize this video's when you kept are just cover

55
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:27,740
well the truth is I I don't like the reason why the Frank Sinatra video is

56
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,210
blocked a lot of countries is because i don't have permission to use that song

57
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,210
so the label blocked in a bunch of trophies is completely out of my control

58
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,889
and if you go back and look at all of my videos before most of my videos before i

59
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:40,849
started blogging

60
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,870
I you songs i didn't have the rights to all the ads you see those aren't mine

61
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,349
what career choice do you want financing to pursue

62
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,699
I says oh and I said anybody i love her care about

63
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,629
I don't care it's whatever makes you happy if that means waiting tables if

64
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,159
that means working with your hands

65
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,580
as long as your work is fulfilling you're doing the right thing

66
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,379
Casey what's with you see to some people who just a dream last night because of

67
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,189
other terrorist systems actions and quake that's you

68
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,430
no matter where you go in this world no matter who you talk to in this world you

69
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,180
will always find good people and you always find bad people and that includes

70
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,639
all races all religions all ethnicities all political everything

71
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,469
the fact that some very narrow minded typically very dim people will associate

72
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:34,229
an entire religion or entire race with something negative is tremendously is

73
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,219
horrible

74
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:40,080
it's absolutely terrible and the xenophobia that is like promoted by so

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,270
many politicians in this very country is really really scary stuff and they use

76
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,539
it as a way to get people scared when people are scared they want to act and

77
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,189
protect themselves and build walls and go to war and do things like that which

78
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,509
unfortunately makes for monitoring a very effective political tool and that's

79
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,050
why we see so much of it but what do I think of what you described which I

80
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,779
would call racism I hate it I hate it

81
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,990
it frustrates me I'm going to end today's Q&A with a little story

82
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,979
this is a super old picture

83
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,930
this is my like 10 years old that's my homie warez i think i have another

84
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,029
picture of war is back here somewhere

85
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:26,069
I see this awesome guy with the tiger that that that's my friend Juarez wars

86
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,460
is one of the first people I ever met when i moved to new york city and i met

87
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,740
him in like it must have been October of 2001 when I met him he had two huge

88
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,020
black eyes and he had those two black guys because he was jumped and beat up

89
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,569
after sep tember 11 for being a Muslim

90
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,649
now he's not a Muslim he's see what happens have a beard and a turban

91
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,339
so some ignorant fools beat him up for no reason

92
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,089
and when I see a great guy i mean he's an amazing guy he's like the jewelry

93
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,080
designer and when i call them and was like I need a ring for kids

94
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,189
this she like stopped everything and he made Candice's wedding ring for me like

95
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,169
a custom like amazing guy

96
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,169
he's also an amazing actor maybe you've seen him

97
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,470
yeah

98
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,520
that's a movie called the life aquatic with steve zissou Bill Murray

99
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,760
directed by wes anderson amazing movie last night

100
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,900
Flores was not let on an airplane in Mexico because of his turban

101
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,910
aeromexico kicked me off flight over turban

102
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,570
that's right he didn't get to fly because of his turban

103
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,220
unbelievable now that is like well that's stupidity is what that is but

104
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,030
that's also racism and Prejudice nuh sand and all those horrible things that

105
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,740
that someone like Juarez

106
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,100
despite how handsome he is because of his traditions

107
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,580
he didn't get to fly that is insane

108
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,580
I can't tell you how frustrating that is

109
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:16,300
yeah

110
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,180
yeah

111
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:31,960
the doorbell just rang and it was a gigantic box of organic box of cookies

112
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,600
with a note

113
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,120
whoo fresh cases so that you're redoing your office i can help you i live in new

114

york and construction background

115
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,120
this is why I such a positive outlook on the world even those things like that

116
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,870
happen my friend Juarez the world is filled up with mostly good people

117
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
yeah

118
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,640
that still needs to be leveled and properly put in place but not a bad

119
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,540
start for day one I have to get back to work now so construction will resume
