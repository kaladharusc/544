00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:03,389
summer is the season in between spring

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,270
and fall it occurs when the Earth on its

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,220
axis tilts in the direction of the Sun

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,550
resulting in longer hotter days this

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,400
summer is 93 days 15 hours and 38

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,160
minutes long summer is short summer is

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,920
special and today is the very first day

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,550
of summer in honor of making the most

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,800
out of summer this video is going to be

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,380
me trying to live out a stupid teenage

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,099
fantasy it starts at some ridiculous

13
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,690
hotel in the south of France the hotel

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,120
has an amazing shower you can tell

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,200
everything you need to know about a

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,789
hotel by its shower it also involves

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,510
room service

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,920
lots of room service co-stars my friend

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Jesse is a great dancer

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,710
there was this fantasy car but this this

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,460
was nice but this wasn't it the problem

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,810
with our driver's licenses because

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,030
neither a tablet so we had to get this

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,290
car instead oh all right back to the

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,390
video and the less cool far this summer

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,570
fantasy it's something like James Bond

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,460
jay-z's but again the part wasn't right

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,560
it's cut be sorry for the interruptions

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,450
in this we're taking this car back we're

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,500
losing this part we're gonna drop the

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,690
whole car scene as hard decision it's

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:50,329
not matching the vibe that we're doing

33
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,420
the colors back in play we got we got

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,280
vanilla we got Iowa heritage

next porky

37
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,020
see I spend the rest of the year waiting

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,030
for and wanting summer some has always

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,290
been a time when I'm in a bathing suit

40
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:30,810
all day kind of look like two dorks

41
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,790
some has always been magical it's never

42
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,680
been like this but I've always imagined

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,310
something like this that's all yeah a

44
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,620
guy can dream you and you're too close

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,850
and the girls are too far Tyla come on I

46
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,350
mean this is a hard shoot case I don't

47
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,390
know how we're gonna make it my favorite

48
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,860
favorite part of the production thus far

49
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,750
yeah we had a huge boat I don't think we

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,130
could make a video like this unless you

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,710
had a type of boat it's the South of

52
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,020
France would you expect come on this is

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,670
my childhood fantasy just go with it

[Music]

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,310
now I'll be the first to recognize this

57
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,170
is not the most original fantasy in the

58
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,390
world I mean look at us we're like

59
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,069
wannabe rock stars who just got our

60
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,560
first advance but that's summer I think

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,599
summer is the will reminding us to get

62
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,099
outside and live a little okay you're

63
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,020
driving now

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,740
[Applause]

65
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,060
it's not necessarily about realizing

66
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,700
absurd childhood ambitions but it is

67
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,770
about having fun and being free to play

68
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,510
and enjoying every damn minute

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,960
[Applause]

crazy hotel room a big boat jet skis or

74
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,750
that car we never drove it's about the

75
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,380
spirit

76
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,270
