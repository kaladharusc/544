1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,319
we're gonna get this underway and we're

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,080
gonna have fun with it that's a the

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,940
rules you have to have fun with it right

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,770
because when you're in space you got to

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,240
have fun or else you just start

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,330
screaming about the inexhaustible

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,380
darkness that surrounds you the

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,030
impenetrable crushing weight of

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,300
nothingness weighing down on your soul

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,160
the only thing around you is this

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,199
screams that fill up your own head

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,150
because no one will ever hear you or

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,760
care the universe is just an uncaring

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,240
endless box of torment built to design

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,050
to hate itself everyone who ever existed

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,110
and ever was is only doomed a destiny to

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,410
die alone sad always pondering the

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,570
endlessness of existence and yet the

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,270
futility that is life there's nothing

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,640
left for us the universe is a big empty

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,640
tomb we're all gonna die a horrible

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,219
horrible death and then we're going to

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,379
play a video game so this is space oh I

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,390
know oh it's real pretty I just you wait

25

there we go there's the Sun everyone's

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,850
blind now alright science lesson number

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,570
one the big glowing ball of fire that go

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,310

okay well there's Pluto Oh quiet out

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,120
farther than Pluto anyway here's Pluto

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,280
Oh spending a little faster right Pluto

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,070
okay so this is universe sandbox so this

52
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,530
game that allows you to explore all of

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,730
the elements of the universe and we're

54
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,270
gonna start by blowing up the Sun kaboom

55
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,340
to fast thereby go out there everybody

56
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,090

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,510
sources of blows up in Chicago Chicago

59
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,680
Chicago

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,709

66
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,180
going whoa Golf is a fire ball let's

67
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,410
start this over something when I know

68
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,830
her if eclis wrong all right so ah I'm

69
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,730
gonna go for just I want the solar

70
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,560
system again or is this a normal solar

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,260
system so this is now in real time let's

72
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,290
do not the real time one cuz the real

73
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,400
time is stupid

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,640
whoa there's quiet air sadness I know

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,230
what are you where'd you come from

76
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,030
look at that look how pretty that is

77
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,850
ain't that pretty

78
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,650
pretty okay let's go back to the Sun

79
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,540
okay you remember Sun right

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,000
you remember Sun everybody remember Sun

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,180
I say big fireball in sky man what the

82
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,040
 someone flying by Sirius was that

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,239
you know goodbye

84
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,180
who mercury come back we'll get you get

85
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,990
your mercury so what uh what I'm gonna

86
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,830
do today is play around until I get

87
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,750
bored let's do a little bit of Education

88
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,750
so I've taught you quite a bit about the

89
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,160
Sun big fire God in sky fire God bring

90
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,950
rain if you pray hard enough along with

91
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,050
hawa it rain hot wives and husbands once

92
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,780
you pray hard enough to Sun God in sky

93
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,720
make sense all right but now let's let's

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,450
carry a few thought experiments all

95
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,150
right so the Sun is big right but it's

96
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,700
not that big because I can show you

97
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,870
something even bigger and it sounds like

98
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,560
a euphemism but hang on so gooey Scootie

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,720
here is um a star police scooty is this

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,780
big compared to our entire solar system

101
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,420
right compared to our tire solar system

102
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,650
who eise Kui is this big and if I were

103
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,970
to pop it down it would encompass

104
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,800
everything including the Sun and the

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,570
entire orbit of Jupiter so let's pop

106
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,490
down ooh a scooty there there's

107
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,530
ooey-gooey what who is scooter why are

108
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,970
you moving

109
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,800
where are you going who is goody where

110
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,940
are you going

111
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,960
what oh hey scooty

112
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,080
where's it where are you going I didn't

113
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
put you with any moment

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,060
okay whatever okay who is Kui I don't

115
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,640
know why let's just get rid of okay I

116
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,710
gotta restart this no that's not what I

117
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,720
expected to happen everybody hold on

118
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,380
your heads

119
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,310
okay so Oh ace cooties that big right so

120
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,240
stars right stars are just measured

121
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,370
pretty much by their mass so this one's

122
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,600
one Sun cuz it's the Sun but it's one

123
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,560
son

124
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,700
so one Sun we can change it up in its

125
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,330
size so let's make this bad boy let's

126
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,630
make this two suns and now as the mass

127
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,980
of two suns

128
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,440
oh whoa okay so that's weird I don't

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,410
know why it says Sun Nova remnant but it

130
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,630
didn't go Nova so what happened is all

131
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,320
of the objects orbiting it suddenly fell

132
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,470
in a not quite circular orbit you can

133
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,240
even see the little bits of the asteroid

134
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,040
belt coming in here pretty cool right

135
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,100
now this is just because the Sun doubled

136
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,290
in size so the gravity well became twice

137
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,240
as steep if you know what I mean

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,670
so everything spirals off in cool ways

139
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,350
like this alright we're going up to

140
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,180
three suns okay now everything cut in

141
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,930
even smaller everything's going deeper

142
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,910
that's fine let's go up to five sons

143
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,660
there it goes

144
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,730
it's like everything's spinning down the

145
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,250
drain see as it gets more massive it not

146
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,780
only gets bigger but just like

147
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,640
everything just spins around it faster

148
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,620
because it kind of has to to keep up its

149
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,699
orbit

150
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,259
things how they go faster down there

151
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,699
we're gonna go all the way up to ten

152
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,979
Suns boom

153
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,310
ooh dass and I spin so mercury should

154
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,110
probably be close enough that it's gonna

155
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,050
start bleeding off part of its matter no

156
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,789
not yet it's getting hot though it's

157
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:47,949
real hot we're gonna go up to 20 this

158
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,919
might actually suck in mercury 20

159
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,819
there we are close up it's fireball okay

160
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:01,180
Mercury's dunzo Oh Mercury's so dunzo

161
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,310
all right so Mercury's done for Venus is

162
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,710
toasty toasty

163
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,569
oh man I'm surprised none of these have

164
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,610
hit each other earth how's earth doing I

165
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,259
didn't even check in on Earth how are we

166
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:16,479
doing ooh-whoo not not good not as good

167
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,129
as you might think and I don't think

168
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:24,279
very good ah okay so Chicago's probably

169
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,319
doing fun but we're not let's go even

170
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,610
bigger let's make this bad boy a

171
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,349
whopping 30 suns and we'll do it right

172
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,140
there gotcha let's go back up to like

173
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,750
six hours a second whoo Venus split up

174
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,490
Venus couldn't handle the pressure

175
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,260
earth is still going strong though Venus

176
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,010
is dunzo Venus is extremely done though

177
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,880
okay by Feeny

178
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,820
Oh oops you're coming in to say hello

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,990
even though Jupiter was going over there

180
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,579
I'm surprised Mercury's still there that

181
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,519
should that's not right oh it's slowed

182
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,350
down I don't know why are we're going up

183
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,690
to 50 this might swallow up everything

184
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,910
we know okay 50

185
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,079
it's now so big

186
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,189
mercury is scraping along its atmosphere

187
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,050
I don't even know how Mercury's still

188
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,339
even intact

189
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,430
it should not be come though it is

190
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,250
coming so close to the Sun I don't

191
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,680

inside the black hole or whatever if it

294
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,730
was a black hole how do I change my

295
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,700
background let me change my background

296
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,640

299
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,190
Skyrim II wanna be a purple there's

300
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:59,290
purple red red cyan solid black solid

301
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,080
gray solid white that's awful

302
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,710
space blue oh that's nice I like that

303
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,940
cuz that gives a little more texture

304
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,310
behind everything space blue green and

305
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,540
yellow space brown perfect poop space

306
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,850
mist well that's kind of what's the

307
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,990
difference between that and space blue

308
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,740
okay I like space mist yeah that's good

309
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,980
stuff maybe yeah space mist okay good

310
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,060
wait what else can I change

311
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,330
hang on I'm too busy all right that'll

312
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,800
be good enough whatever it's probably

313
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,120
not as good as default but I don't know

314
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,850
I don't care I like it okay so you see

315
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,470
this thing right all right I'm gonna see

316
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,200
what happens when I blow up a black hole

317
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,920
because I honestly don't know

318
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,989
some awfully dramatic music for what

319
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:45,369
appears to be nothing happening

320
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:47,470
wait there's suddenly like tons and tons

321
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,389
of these son Nova fragments coming out

322
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:53,079

okay that's weird okay we somehow blew

328
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,990
up a black hole I'm not sure how and I

329
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,970
was a little bizarre and I got try that

330
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,630
again and its second here okay all right

331
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,350
black hole pretty big boy not as big as

332
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,630
our previous big it's gone well there it

333
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:02,870
is

334
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,020
oh no it's tiny by comparison it is tiny

335
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,270
okay well this is a Wimpy baby size

336
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,280
black hole let make it even bigger even

337
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,120
bigger to the 20th huge even okay this

338
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,880
is huge real big but there's nothing

339
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
else to scale to put it by so let's put

340
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,839
a galaxy next to it by scale our

341
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,540
pinwheel galaxy right there Oh big okay

342
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,540
so that's the pinwheel galaxy and here's

343
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,570
our black hole so I want to make this

344
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,200
even bigger

345
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,590
oh it nevermind it's way bigger than the

346
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,480
Milky Way itself where did I put that

347
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,230
galaxy okay now it's real big now it's

348
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,270
Eve that's the maximum in that it could

349
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,010
possibly be it is now as big as it could

350
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,800
ever physically be where did that galaxy

351
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,240
go did this black hole swallow that

352
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,420
galaxy cuz that's an interesting

353
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,220
conundrum okay we're gonna blow this

354
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,260
thing up again this is now the biggest

355
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,730
black hole that you could possibly make

356
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,220
in the entire game let's see what

357
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,760
happens

358
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,220
[Music]

359
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,710
and it just

360
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,040
and that's it hey just go poof it's just

361
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,930
tiny poof and then it go bye-bye

362
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,030
all right well that's that's

363
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,140
anticlimactic Milky Way right dere wait

364
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,790
where'd it go

365
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,740
okay I think I I think I've really

366
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,330
royally borked

367
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,880
this entire game because it doesn't seem

368
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,130
to be working anymore what is that

369
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:41,830
where do we go oh can I blow you up and

370
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:49,230
blow up a galaxy I blow this up oh I

371
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,070
shouldn't have done that

372
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,100
Oh

373
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:09,549
[Music]

374
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:16,429
what's going on here okay I don't know

375
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,890
what this is definitely not supposed to

376
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:25,669
happen okay oh all right let's just

377
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:27,980
reset this because this is now gotten

378
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,210
beyond ridiculous

379
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,230
good old solar system okay so now let's

380
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,330
punish earth specifically so earth is a

381
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,960
real good place right real nice

382
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,770
everybody loves Earth right okay now

383
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,169
imagine and just imagine what if earth

384
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,140
was not okay right

385
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,140
you know like can you imagine that like

386
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,700
if Kepler Kepler Kepler Kepler oh if

387
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,299
Kepler was warbling oh hi Kepler Oh

388
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,250
ah okay well they're there when

389
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,820
earth okay listen about another Kepler

390
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,630
Oh

391
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,080

okay all right Kepler okay where to mass

403
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:16,270
to mass to mass boom hats to mass to

404
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,780
mass to mass wools look at him spin

405
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,480
dough mass tome ass oh

406
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,950
to mass boom ass comb ass to mass that's

407
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,410
its name it's to mass okay which one's

408
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,840
the main one is this a man 1 this is to

409
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
mass or to mask it back beef get your

410
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,890
ass back here to mass Oh

411
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,030
Tobi's kept Kepler her Easter Kepler did

412
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,340
you survive all that Kepler

413
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,100
oh the rampage of to mass never ends

414
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,290
Kepler how did you survive that I don't

415
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,480
even know I mean you're not gonna I'm

416
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,420
gonna make sure you don't but you know

417
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,190
how these tiny little baby plants God to

418
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,390
a mass tome toe mass all right to mass

419
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,180
listen here

420
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,040
for a second there I thought the

421
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,600
Sephiroth battle music just kicked up

422
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,760
just like Sephiroth comes in here blows

423
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,980
up the Sun he goes

424
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,310
I'm sorry okay let's try this again

425
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,520
Ganymede tiny tiny Ganymede okay listen

426
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,070
Ganymede can actually probably orbit in

427
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,880
a relatively nice way if it wasn't

428
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,680
forced into this situation where it's

429
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,420
not doing that you know what I mean

430
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,110
our Ganymede okay now all of you there

431
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,720
are struggling to survive but I'm about

432
00:22:50,720 --> 00:23:06,420
to put a kibosh in that idea kaboom

433
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,880
Wow okay way back to the whatever the

434
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,320
hell we were doing okay so all the

435
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,270
Ganymede's you go blow up blow up blow

436
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,030
blow blow blow blow blow blow blow blow

437
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,840
I said blow Mars you're good you're next

438
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,670
you're next on the chopping block okay

439
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,180
Mars

440
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,580
everybody knows Mars the shining beacon

441
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,110
of love in the universe right okay

442
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:40,500
so imagine if how about what if we do a

443
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,690
bowling ball at the speed of light okay

444
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,250
there's the bowling ball what bowling

445
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,770
balls gone okay here's the bowling ball

446
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,440
go Shoom we're going what's a bowling

447
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,560
ball gonna do shot at light speed to

448
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:12,020
Mars Dan three two one

449
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,990

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,360
launching these but it's just going so

452
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,500
fast I can't see it new horizon no Tesla

453
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,540
Roadster no Great Pyramid there that had

454
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,750
an impact I feel like the others would

455
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,700
too

456
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,710
okay so that worked rival spacecraft

457
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,200
whoa that's not where I threw it but

458
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,800

461
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,320
right there you see that what is it

462

flashing hoots good someone's

463
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,850
communicating come on Saturn

464
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,640
who's there Kepler oh you were

465
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,600
communicating

466
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,020
oh well beer you're welcome alright see

467
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,510
ya anyway good bye bye Saturn Mars

468
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,740
where's Mars

469
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,260
have I seen Mars why's Mars running

470
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,960
there's Mars okay there we go so you

471
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,140
guys know Mars right you remember Mars

472
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,270
I think everybody does so what if

473
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,130
instead of that we threw an asteroid at

474
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:34,440
the speed of light oh okay that that's

475
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,900
that's something okay that's what they

476
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,790
would call a lot of damaged parts of

477
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,620
that hurt what about Pluto at the speed

478
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,350
of light curve ball well let's see how

479
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,030
fast I can get this bad boy to spin I

480
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,180
keep going keep going keep going let's

481
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,730
get some oh come on there no okay I

482
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,930
always got to hit in the direction then

483
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,640
it's spinning there's quite a spin on

484
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,950
this bad boy was a rotational speed on

485
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,070
that one I have no idea it's broche lobe

486
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,210
radius is 1.7 million kilometers and

487
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,270
rising what is it what is that what's

488
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,730
the Roche lobe radius hang on

489
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,060
oh it's the region around the star in a

490
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,470
binary system within the orbiting

491
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,150
materials gravitationally bound to that

492
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,420
star so I don't know what it means cool

493
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,740
to plant it down

494
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,570
I'm gonna do that but he expect me to do

495
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,490
that I can't do that it's not within my

496
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,820
power do you think a comet will do it no

497
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,030
that didn't do it a lot more comets No

498
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,440
okay oddly enough that didn't seem to do

499
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,120
it Eris no make make no okay she seems

500
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,309
to be going faster it's not any cooler I

501
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:51,059
don't know why water okay alright water

502
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,270
it's now a hundred percent water uh it's

503
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,840
not any cooler guys you might have been

504
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,740
wrong about it it's very uh not cool how

505
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,030
about if I give it some material water

506
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,010
here we go I'm gonna shoot some water at

507
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,040
it ah it's like a sprinkler here we go

508
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,720
now we got it you're gonna cool right

509
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,700
down there buddy boo don't worry about

510
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,130
it let me worry about it it doesn't seem

511
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,800
to be helping much oh it hasn't even

512
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,860
reached it yet oh I'm sorry

513
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,090
there goes now it's reaching it

514
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,490
quenching the thirst of it right here we

515
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,330
go oh now that's quenched oh now that's

516
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,910
quench something good oh no that's real

517
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,690
quench

518
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,600
well that's quench tastic oh that's so

519
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,290
quenched

520
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,960
I might even be quenched all right let's

521
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,920
uh some more can I get more please can

522
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,360
we have it faster I mean I can't be

523
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,790
waiting around forever for it oh here we

524
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,220
go now oh yeah now that's a Quan Chi oh

525
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,980
oh this is real quench Abel okay a nice

526
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,280
spiral of Quan Chi a you lazy water

527
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,880
bastards does seem to be working okay

528
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,040
maybe I need more particles alright let

529
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,330
me try this I'm gonna throw a thousand

530
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,290
Jupiter's worth of water at Mars here we

531
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,660
go oh that's gonna take forever to reach

532
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,160
ok whatever it's gonna hit this is a

533
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,130
thousand Jupiter's of water ah

534
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:35,820
[Laughter]

535
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:47,000
[Music]

536
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,700
what happened to my background no it was

537
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,500
all right that didn't work let's blow

538
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:08,330
that up oh it's still spinning

539
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,610
[Laughter]

540
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,580
[Music]

541
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,799
okay Mars not do so good but you know

542
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,590
hey that's alright where's Venus Venus

543
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,289
come on over there how did we get that

544
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:31,169
far out of the system by the way I don't

545
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,760
know just me hitting it with so many

546
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,830
things I'd eventually just push it so

547
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,440
far away you seem to be outlets uh I

548
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
know there's a way to reset its orbits

549
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,860
Auto orbit BAM done alright rotational

550
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,429
period is gonna be one day okay one day

551
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:52,890
one day who gonna be 0.5 day

552
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,730
woohoo alright I know Venus wanted to be

553
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,450
just a little more toasty six-hour

554
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,580
rotational period alright how about it

555
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:09,060
to our rotational

556
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,290
[Music]

557
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,310
okay we're just gonna Oh everybody look

558
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,400
away for a second just look away just

559
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:30,460
look away just look like Venus Venus I

560
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,380
forgot you're going the speed of light

561
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,980
oh oh I launched ah okay

562
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,310
 mercury buddy mercury

563
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,410
listen mercury listen don't worry about

564
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,970
don't worry about what the other just

565
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,330
just don't worry okay you seem worried

566
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,350
for some odd reason mercury listen all

567
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,530
those other planets were just dumb right

568
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,160
you're not dumb you're smart right all

569
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,990
right mercury if there's one thing I've

570
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,860
heard about you

571
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,460
mercury is that you want some moons so

572
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,390
here's one moon - here's if I could just

573
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,750
know not launch okay not launch we're

574
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,600
gonna orbit the moon is gonna orbit you

575
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,800
okay well there's got to be a tight

576
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,510
orbit or you're gonna lose it to the Sun

577
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,940
so you got to really hold on tight to

578
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,570
this one okay hold on tight okay and you

579
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,270
want one more hold on tight to that moon

580
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,160
can have up moon how about a moon for

581
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,110
the moon gonna have a nice moon moon

582
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,930
there we go Moon Moon for the moon you

583
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:46,909
get a moon - moon

584
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:53,159
moon moon moon moon know that moon can't

585
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,740
stay that's that's a bad moon okay

586
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,460
so mercury has moons which mercury has

587
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,950
always wanted moons I know this I've

588
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:12,799
heard this and it's gonna be fine

589
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,749
 anyway enough about that that's

590
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:17,849
stupid and dumb let's where did

591
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,190
everything else in the universe go or

592
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,139
the solar system go where Jupiter go why

593
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,159
see Jupiter over here

594
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,129
Jupiter you trying to run away from me

595
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:27,719
are you going towards wait what's it

596
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:31,139
going towards are you going venus is

597
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,699
still going off that way where are you

598
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,529
going are to mass how are you doing how

599
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,959
are you doing - mass all right listen to

600
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,879
mass I may not have been very nice to

601
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:41,039
you but I'm gonna give you I'll give you

602
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,819
another gas giant here two-ton kurrus

603
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:46,369
get yep

604
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:54,299
ton cursed dekap tun chorus dekap DD the

605
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,229
foie the toast egg door yeah well that's

606
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:02,190
dumb what if I launch him at you is that

607
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,979
even hitting you is this even hitting

608
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:08,309
you is this hitting you how do I know

609
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,139
that this is hitting you well it seems

610
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:14,429
to be hitting him I think oh we are cuz

611
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:16,349
we're moving that's how we got moved out

612
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:19,769
cuz I you hit him Oh cuz I punched him

613
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:24,779
oh that's real there's real fast and far

614
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,879
away how am I going so fast and let's go

615
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,459
faster how fast can we go we're going up

616
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:33,119
to a moment of max speed whatever the

617
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,859
max speed is I'm hitting it oh okay

618
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,169
we're now going three point three four

619
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:43,639
times 10 to the 14th the speed of light

620
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:45,029
huh

621
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,999
I can't even focus on this thing took to

622
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:52,409
mass you okay there buddy to mass 2 -

623
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:57,760
Matt OH -

624
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,850
boom dome ass computers time to scaling

625
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,150
seems to be jumping real far too to me

626
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,030
you you're breaking all senses of logic

627
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,520
a rotational period let's make it point

628
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,770
oooo 1 so now it's spinning super fast -

629
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,930
can i zoom in on oh

630
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,410
Oh where's to mass ok err its to miss ok

631
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,370
to mass trying to land on to mass -

632
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,590
oh god oh god

633
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,490
oh I apparently I've landed on to mess

634
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,230
but it's so broken the laws of physics

635
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,970
at this point that I don't think there's

636
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,280
any way that it could possibly actually

637
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,400
not just be awful ok zooming out again

638
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,380
woof all right you know what I'm just

639
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,000
gonna let that go Oh oh my god I'm

640
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,620
zooming in there we are that's how far

641
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,400
away we were

642
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,850
where's to mass to mass there's do a

643
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:01,880
mass oh god oh god look at everything

644
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,650
else it's struggling just to calculate

645
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,090
the speed of to mass oh god oh god

646
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:15,640
all positional accuracy has gone it is -

647
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,200
alright I think we broke it okay we

648
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,150
figured out what broke it so let's go

649
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,910
out of here all plants almonds Saturn is

650
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,320
this oh my god

651
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,800
Saturn is dripping with moons God's at a
