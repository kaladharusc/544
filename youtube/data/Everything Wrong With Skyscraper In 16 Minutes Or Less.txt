1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,650
44 seconds of logos are you people not

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,840
paying attention or what also Comcast if

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,309
I don't see taillights in the next five

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,480
minutes Lee that audio is from a phone

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,920
call do they take hostage calls over

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,510
ISDN now because that was some

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,949
crystal-clear reception if these guys

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,539
had to rappel down this rock face to get

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,010
back here undetected how did the rocks

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,570
actual face get back here to hide

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,429
underneath this perfectly placed camo

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,869
shield most movies just read a line of

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,250
dialogue about how the rocks character

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,170
is former military or was previously an

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,489
NFL player this movie goes out of its

16
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,440
way to actually film that backstory and

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
I can't decide if I want to applaud it

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,320
or give it the finger wait

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,180
nope just made up my mind also this

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,920
opening a hostage situation handling

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
scene intended to give our main

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,770
character situational credibility for

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,270
later is giving me so many of the

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,010
negotiator vibes I'm this close to

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,090
crying foul yeah let's do it

26
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,320
[Music]

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,820
turn around where the hell was that kid

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,620
hiding that no one saw him until he

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,090
turned around was he tiny and just grew

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,710
really quickly is he part SeaMonkey is

31
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,750
he part SeaMonkey also why did he even

32
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,040
have him over there in the first place

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,900
so he hears them bust in and immediately

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,520
grabs a hostage and then turns around

35
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
and sets him on the counter what the

36
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,049
hell and it was like the movie I sure do

37
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,150
oh goody it's the rear double impossible

38
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,070
surprise turn around this time we are

39
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,509
supposed to buy that he's been holding

40
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,920
that detonator this whole time and that

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,390
no one noticed his shirt look bulky

42
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,130
before now either this movie is stupid

43
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,630
or these SWAT guys are stupid and I'll

44
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,130
give you one guess which two things I

45
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,659
think it is okay

46
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,799
Jesus this movie about a giant

47
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,360
skyscraper rescue will is probably

48
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,979
likely to be full of enough bull

49
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,479
coincidences without you Florence

50
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,400
Nightingale his love interest from the

51
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,380
Great Pyramid of Giza to the Tower of

52
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,450
Babel news raishin mankind has been

53
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,810
consumed by one singular desire to touch

54
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,600
the sky what about planes or spacemen we

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,250
sent men to the moon and I'm pretty sure

56
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,750
they touch the sky and then gave it the

57
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,159
finger as they blasted through it into

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,540
outer space I know you want to build up

59
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,100
your fucking skyscrapers some kind of

60
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,750
important thing but making super tall

61
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,130
buildings sound like one of man's

62
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,869
greatest longings it's just silly

63
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,640
going so far as to build a 30-story

64
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,159
physical park at the building center

65
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
sounds practical hey Timmy go along I

66
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,420
mean go deep wait that sounds wrong to

67
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,429
me get high oh that's not right either

68
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,349
hey Timmy let's just go to a regular

69
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,390
non-vertical Park what do you say this

70
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,590
isn't just another

71
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,910
building it's a building but for some

72
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,349
reason looks like a snake trying to eat

73
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,209
a tennis ball and also is located in

74
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,040
Hong Kong for structural reasons that

75
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,420
have absolutely nothing to do with the

76
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,069
international box office numbers the

77
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,720
post speaks to what we can achieve when

78
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,599
we don't accept limitation five Pirates

79
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,099
of the Caribbean movies and you dick OHS

80
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,660
still decide to call this thing up in

81
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,700
pearl we're gonna we look I know the

82
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,470
rock reached out to amputees and did

83
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,640
what he could to make this character

84
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,680
respectful and not an exploitation and I

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
know the movie probably can't get funded

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,440
and made if there's not a high-profile

87
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,390
action star attached but I'm still going

88
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,250
on the record that this feels wrong and

89
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,829
icky and at the very best super Google

90
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,340
is at I know but you should let me fix

91
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,780
your tie because apparently even though

92
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,340
you are a grown-ass man you can't tie

93
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,140
your own so that we can have an intimate

94
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,670
moment and build our relationship cliche

95
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,900
just because you're a smaller company

96
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,879
does not mean that you don't belong the

97
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,980
noise of all the tiny violins playing my

98
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,329
heart bleeds for thee for this truly

99
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:05,970
pitiable bastard here is deafening what

100
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,349
did I tell you to do anytime something's

101
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,090
wrong if I try turning it off and on

102
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,799
again try turning it off and on again

103
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,989
but when shadowy I teased Blaney this is

104
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,849
what a 30-story park looks like apart

105
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,010
with 30 stories of air above it thanks

106
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,540
for putting in a good word come on it's

107
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,989
nothing

108
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,459
movie could not be signaling this guy's

109
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,019
evilness more if he was wearing a black

110
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,790
hooded cape and carrying a side is this

111
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,230
movie sponsored by Scripps because it's

112
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,609
just spelling everything out one of the

113
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,600
reasons they don't actually build

114
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,310
buildings this tall in real life is that

115
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,720
if they did it'd be physically

116
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,280
impossible to have enough elevators to

117
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,239
serve the needs of the building's

118
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,829
tenants and anyone that's ever stayed in

119
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,359
a midtown Manhattan hotel that was

120
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,440
exactly what I'm talking about

121
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,510
the pearls anti-fire measures employ a

122
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,730
one-of-a-kind self sealing ventilation

123
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,349
system could God did the producers of

124
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,549
this movie think the phrase was tell

125
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,349
don't show considering this exposition

126
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,910
mission continues for quite some time

127
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,560
let's just add another 15 cents and move

128
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,630
on it's the safest super tall structure

129
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,489
in the world its Fort Knox mile in the

130
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,310
sky man what a great analogy I mean I

131
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,900
wouldn't trade that analogy for all the

132
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,000
golden no no no this is awkward

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,709
once I inspect the security at the

134
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,569
off-site facility my job will be done

135
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,370
which for some strange reason I didn't

136
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,870
do before having this very important

137
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,299
meeting today because reasons it's

138
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:09,870
incredible

139
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,269
I'm over there I just can't Irene do you

140
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,829
lose depth perception when you lose a

141
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,479
limb in what world would you actually a

142
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,979
mistake a projected image as a real

143
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,419
person it's maybe the single dumbest

144
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,800
thing I've seen in a movie this year and

145
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,030
I watched a freaking no movie that's

146
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,490
is comprised of nearly 25,000

147
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,830
ultra-high-definition panels I think I

148
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,100
speak for everyone when I say my welcome

149
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,169
to heaven mr. Sawyer and then he just

150
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,810
king left him there I haven't touched a

151
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,639
gun in ten years it's important to the

152
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,990
rock to play characters that don't

153
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,790
believe in violence he's on a boat but

154
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,110
we've also been told he's going directly

155
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,760
from a skyscraper to the off-site

156
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,350
monitoring facility just over a mile

157
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,910
away and we already saw that there is no

158
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,500
need to catch a ferry to make that trip

159
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,630
as roads will suffice the funny thing is

160
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,910
without that bad luck I never would have

161
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,040
met Sara I'm just gonna go out on a limb

162
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,780
and say if a wall collapses in the

163
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,980
sub-basement of the world's tallest

164
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,690
building I'd probably be pretty quick to

165
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,100
call someone and also probably get the

166
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,450
hell out of there instead of you know

167
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,400
slowly exploring it myself like some

168
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
sort of lame horror movie stooge armed

169
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,870
intruder pink jump scares man how the

170
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,270
pandas well we didn't really get to see

171
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,400
them because Henry ate a weird candy and

172
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,430
started throwing up King Henry did he

173
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,410
have an attack no he's breathing fine

174
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,900
son has asthma are you goddamn kidding

175
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,310
me with his I guess the daughter's

176
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,169
probably hypoglycemic and Sarah herself

177
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,030
has split ends or lymphoma or something

178
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,410
right this movie is all the hurdles

179
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,300
sarah is super suspicious about these

180
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,220
dudes but then does not call her husband

181
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,780
back immediately or anyone apparently

182
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,490
she just quit scary shot in the

183
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,990
prosthetic leg Aang this is just the

184
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,370
first of many times the movie will make

185
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,080
it convenient that its main character

186
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,120
has a prosthetic leg I guess some people

187
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,830
really will do anything to get a leg up

188
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,130
on the competition why is the dishwasher

189
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,500
even open to Hamza jaw here come back to

190
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
patch up roadblocks arm and then decide

191
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,620
to do some light housework I just want

192
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,880
to know because apparently knowing is

193
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,880
half the battle wasn't supposed to be

194
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,270
that so if Sydney and the chips off the

195
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,010
old rockier weren't even supposed to be

196
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,930
there why did they start the fire near

197
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,400
the floor they were staying on we only

198
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
needed the mask while dumping the

199
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,490
chemical but now that the chemical is

200
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,440
merely lying on the floor in piles we

201
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,150
won't be needing these anymore

202
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,610
that's a mess house on fire and you find

203
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,740
out what including those I know we've

204
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,419
seen plenty of corny Hiro one-liners

205
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,800
villains have their fair share of

206
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,180
stopping whatever they're doing to say

207
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,010
clever things as well I mean who's he

208
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,010
even talking to the buildings on fire

209
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,810
the building isn't on fire the 96th

210
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,030
floors on fire what an asshole what kind

211
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,320
of person takes things literally and out

212
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,880
of context when they obviously knew it

213
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,110
was intended just so they can make a

214
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,669
smart ass point that their subscribers

215
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,740
might think is funny wait what so

216
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,750
hold on if they had to scan his face to

217
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,550
get access to the tablet anyway what was

218
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,990
the plan if they had stolen it from him

219
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,699
on the boat when they've had to find him

220
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,199
anyway he is about to ride a motorcycle

221
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,479
run and otherwise get to the skyscraper

222
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,250
without once needed to cross water in a

223
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,039
ferry just FYI on so is the fire on a

224
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,020
floor right below them I'm so confused

225
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,949
there's probably some sort of

226
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,240
explanation for all this that I missed

227
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,289
when I fell asleep during all the

228
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,729
exposition but Mubi certainly doesn't

229
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,050
seem interested in clearing it up and

230
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,400
the more I learn the more that random

231
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,900
encounter with the bad guys seems more

232
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,130
and more convenient don't worry about

233
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,349
there and there's a lot of smoke a lot

234
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,030
about the Cat Stevens right this

235
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,979
dialogue just remember there's a lot of

236
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:22,330
smoke and it's hard to get by just upon

237
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,930
a smile huh so the fire is on 96 and the

238
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,030
rock band is on 98 but then answer me

239
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,440
this why did the bad guys encounter the

240
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,789
family on floor 98 when they were

241
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,830
setting the fire material on floor 96

242
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,659
why would they ever have even gone above

243
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,270
ninety six but needlessly blasted all

244
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,770
the employees here with machine guns

245
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,630
that fired into all these computers and

246
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,009
screens but apparently the one they need

247
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,229
to use went untouched seal all the fire

248
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,080
doors 95 to the ground disable all

249
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,300
energy fire mixtures from 96 to the top

250
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,090
why the plan was to gain full access to

251
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,889
the building all along why not just wait

252
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,509
until you had that access to even set

253
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,889
the fire in the first place what if

254
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:00,969
something goes wrong and you've blown

255
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,380
your plan by putting the fire before the

256
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,080
horse something also why even set it on

257
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
that floor if you want to cause an

258
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,050
evacuation at the penthouse why not set

259
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,639
the fire on the floor directly below it

260
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,020
and a building with that many stories it

261
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,430
seems the only one you care about is a

262
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,319
story about this family who has to

263
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
conveniently escape upwards as the fire

264
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,099
chases them tell me what you see you are

265
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,110
looking at it I was the point it's a

266
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,330
video call they survive this but only

267
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,159
because that's not how fire works good

268
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,479
thing the phone didn't break drop the

269
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,460
call or land face down or behind

270
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,380
anything or isn't blocked by smoke that

271
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,759
for some reason this fire doesn't create

272
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,349
cuz you know if you thought they were

273
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,520
dead there would be no reason for the

274
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,959
rock to continue to do more and more

275
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,520
ridiculous and implausible stunts to get

276
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,990
to them and the movie would be over god

277
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,969
forbid also that phone is absolutely

278
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,110
pointed at the ceiling and would never

279
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,450
in a million years shoot this angle is

280
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,950
he hearing the audio from this giant

281
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,630
building size TV across the street so

282
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,680
they just leave the volume on that thing

283
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,270
max down all the time or just when the

284
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,620
plot needs the police to hear some

285
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,209
information and become another

286
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,040
Ross was obstacle what's stupider that

287
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,119
these are the only two cops in this

288
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,860
super crowded area or that will is about

289
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,720
to Jason borne them on purpose because

290
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,490
he believes he's the only one that could

291
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,600
save his family on the cops will never

292
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,610
understand literally the only human on

293
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,399
the planet does that can practice yeah

294
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,740
it's pretty smart right I don't even

295
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,089
know anymore if this movie actually

296
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,129
wants to make sense and I would like to

297
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,899
leave now I like how he didn't encounter

298
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,490
any more cops between that busy

299
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,839
intersection in this construction site

300
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,610
and also no locks or security measures

301
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,839
at the ground level of this construction

302
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,089
site I think everyone has their my

303
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,559
family I'm getting out of here breaking

304
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,360
point and I'm just saying mine would

305
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,889
have been way before now huggies

306
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,170
presents pull ups the movie so here's

307
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,999
the idea the rock is gonna run

308
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,800
full-speed off a super crane while being

309
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,869
shot at and leap about fifty feet into a

310
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,579
window on the floor below it's going to

311
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:39,069
be a mix you have to be running like 20

312
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:40,540
miles an hour on a prosthetic leg to

313
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,129
even get close to making that job come

314
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:43,839
on it'll be in slow motion a hundred

315
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,579
stories up with the lit up Hong Kong

316
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,050
skyline behind him while he does that

317
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,699
whole running on the air flailing thing

318
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,319
only a barely grabbed on a piece of

319
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,360
metal and swing himself up by one who

320
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,319
will even care

321
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:55,300
cinemasins cares motherfucker cinemasins

322
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,220
cares you just knew the action would

323
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,839
bring our hero's family to the 30-story

324
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,399
tall Park you knew that when they showed

325
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,170
it to you it's basically check offs 30

326
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:09,529
story tall Park why would they stop

327
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,149
so is that the plan make a perfect shot

328
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,800
to kill the pilot who will for whatever

329
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,509
reason still be holding the controls

330
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,160
costing the chopper to run forward and

331
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,660
possibly kill everyone in its way that

332
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,059
seems likely a terrible shot this

333
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,589
assholes stormtrooper cousin disowned

334
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,499
him due to his horrible aim true story

335
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,660
dominated that system I can't open the

336
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,550
doors with this tablet you guys really

337
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,410
plan for everything didn't you got a

338
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,720
movement elect and my fancy tablet not

339
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,129
only has a camera that is immediately

340
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:36,870
following them and also identifies them

341
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,579
by name and also somehow hasn't been

342
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:39,809
destroyed by the fire or had its

343
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,129
visibility limited by any smoke

344
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:43,920
screwdrivers hammers vodka tape also

345
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,749
this movie is die hard meets towering

346
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,240
inferno meets the equalizer meets paint

347
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,610
firewall and all 22 people who saw fire

348
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,439
wall just exclaimed okay thank you

349
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:57,089
you can't fix with duct tape and sure

350
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,189
obvious diehard ripoff is obvious but I

351
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,230
at least feel like john-boy was human

352
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,790
and die hard when McLain walked barefoot

353
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,470
across the class you could feel the pain

354
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,149
if the rock did it in this movie he

355
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,529
would adjust the glass shards in the

356
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,089
bottom of his feet for maximum traction

357
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,709
and then run straight up a wall carving

358
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,120
his name in it along the way that's

359
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,069
right listen to your mommy

360
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,629
well technically their dad was a mummy

361
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,129
she's their mommy but I get the

362
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,629
confusion and the Scorpion King is

363
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,009
lingering around here somewhere but he

364
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,429
could have died in the fire when I say

365
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:25,139
things like the circumstances conspired

366
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,910
to keep her from her kids what I really

367
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,920
mean is this movie can suck my balls oh

368
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,110
come on just seconds after a convenient

369
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,490
piece of the building separates Sarah

370
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,199
from her kids a convenient burning tree

371
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,759
separates the siblings was this building

372
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,110
also built with a state of the art plot

373
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,389
device system gorgeous Esther Christ

374
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,220
this is a video game cutscene but not

375
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,629
only that one of those levels that takes

376
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,209
you like a hundred tries to beat it and

377
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,800
video games the rock holding the bridge

378
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,660
steady via two ropes while it supposedly

379
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,579
tries to collapse while his wife walks

380
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,410
the plank to retrieve their son is the

381
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,970
most rockingest thing Dwayne the rock

382
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,009
Johnson has ever done on film and it's

383
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,749
laughable this movie actively hates

384
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:03,329
physics also why send the wife to bring

385
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:04,649
the son why not just tell the son to

386
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,149
crawl across we're wasting time and

387
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,980
energy sending wild things over to carry

388
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,420
him back are we not but I gotta get you

389
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,350
guys out of this bill

390
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,690
Henry Henry King Henry I need you to be

391
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,790
brave right now you do that for me well

392
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,080
Dan I do have the chronic asthma

393
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,480
aggravated by the smoke and we're 130

394
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,100
stories into the sky and a building on

395
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,900
fire but if you think spouting cliches

396
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,400
at me is gonna help I'm happy to respond

397
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,680
in kind

398
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,670
unless the laws of inertia have been

399
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,590
revoked as fast as they drop they should

400
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,670
be slammed against the top of this

401
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,410
elevator with no way to reach that break

402
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,880
in time if you ask me this just seems

403
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,290
like a recipe for Campbell's soup I've

404
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,000
had televisions for a long time and I've

405
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
never once turned one on and had it tell

406
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
me something I needed to know about my

407
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
life but apparently this is the thing

408
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,820
because it happens for the rock every

409
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,480
day I'm Tom behind the turbines movies

410
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,070
ins itself the other script and then

411
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,720
Will's reaction to the script we had an

412
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,380
accent

413
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,720
Scandinavian I think six-foot white

414
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,580
muscular this is the man you saw me

415
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,070
buddhu witchcraft right here computers

416
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,930
can't even explain this just vague

417
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,580
description of every European ever then

418
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,410
we found him I've done the whole duct

419
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,030
tape hands thing that's most homeowners

420
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,740
half especially those with forecasts or

421
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,970
a spider problem the point is the

422
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,560
stickiness of that wears off in a matter

423
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,060
of seconds even though this movie is

424
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,590
going to give him Tom Cruise levels of

425
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,420
proverbial rope here we go again you

426
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,650
know what I'm sick of how flat-out

427
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,240
impossible everything is in this movie

428
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,740
so let's just speed this along shall we

429
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,500
this works this works this works this

430
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,320
works this works this works this works

431
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,560
this works one

432
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,410
this works this works this works this

433
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,380
works this works this works this works

434
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,820
this works and this works also Pearl Jam

435
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,470
what he didn't know was that I hit

436
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,970
traffic software and said know why you

437
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,260
tons of fun that's not how wire

438
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,670
transfers work this was my insurance

439
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,449
policy

440
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,010
and I kept it on an external hard drive

441
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,540
that looked like a Decepticon and would

442
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,639
barely fit in my pocket because

443
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,079
technology but Ethan gets his hands on

444
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,149
this he can reverse-engineer my tracking

445
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,920
software and hide their identities

446
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,510
before anyone's the wiser what's that

447
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,829
girl there's trouble down at the old

448
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,870
well let's go we lit this entire

449
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,459
building on fire knowing that you would

450
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,779
take the most valuable thing in this

451
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,820
world to you and run gives my headaches

452
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,579
headaches its information it's once and

453
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,620
zeros email that upload it to Dropbox

454
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,779
there was literally no reason to use an

455
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,459
oversize Iron Man flash drive is the

456
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,839
original hard copy of what is

457
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,699
essentially digital data you hacked a

458
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:18,880
wire transfer by the way and learn the

459
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,170
names of the crime syndicate bad guys

460
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,050
back is data Jesus jumpin Christ on a

461
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,329
lukewarm eggo waffle so what's the plan

462
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,449
got any duct tape oh you guys Total

463
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:30,250
Recall call and look Bing know they're

464
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,480
gonna have to get in line but they'd

465
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,589
still like to have a word about this

466
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,709
scene well this is fun and it's gonna

467
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,420
happen about 20 more times here and you

468
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,940
know what that means

469
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,319
go go go

470
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,389
the rocks wife who is a nurse will now

471
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,040
go toe to toe with the badass assassin

472
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,209
girl the movie has already basically

473
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,800
made out to be unkillable Oh for fuck's

474
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,660
sake tablet has been useless to the

475
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,920
assassin chicks since halfway through

476
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,880
the film when it couldn't get her

477
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,139
buddies into the penthouse why is she

478
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,339
even still carrying around for

479
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,230
assassinate duties all right you win

480
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,699
considering we all know that he's

481
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,589
actually right behind him I want you to

482
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:01,750
consider these things that DJ would be

483
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,519
talking to feet behind him and not be

484
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,139
hurt that he drops that gun right by

485
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,060
their feet that where is camera that

486
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,889
gets that clean of a picture without his

487
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,300
daughter and Kaptur blocking its view

488
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,769
that video glitch that only happens

489
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:13,959
after he gives away the twist and at him

490
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,839
giving away a buyer in no way gives him

491
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,610
any advantage he didn't already have and

492
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,569
that he almost certainly would have

493
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,069
kicked his daughter down this hole based

494
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,839
on where she was standing and if this

495
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,459
room they are in is basically a thousand

496
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,139
degree metal oven at this point and tell

497
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:27,850
me if you can think of any reason not to

498
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,860
give one of the most bull climaxes in

499
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,449
the history of film and extra sin for

500
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,310
every floor and this logic forsaken

501
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,050
building it's what it thought you bet

502
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,519
your fuckin ass I'm sending the fact

503
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,870
that she's able to reboot the fire

504
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,220
suppression system

505
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,110
Lee over-the-air in a building that is

506
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,509
90% on fire the only promise the movie

507
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,100
ever really had was knowing that this

508
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,660
giant ball was gonna fall off the top

509
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,339
and crash into the sea or onto the road

510
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:48,939
below

511
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:51,759
uh-uh nope movie is too stupid to even

512
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,279
give us that I'd remove all the sins if

513
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,110
one of these reporters or EMTs we're to

514
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,490
lift their head and reveal themselves to

515
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,079
be Vin Diesel okay no I wouldn't remove

516
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,370
the sits but that would still make this

517
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,899
movie way better which is saying

518
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:02,350
something

519
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,240
lucky bad thing I said to myself when

520
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,529
this movie finally ended somehow I made

521
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:20,649
it into the film just get in the car I

522
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,170
did burn some men just want to watch the

523
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,959
world burn my program seizes the phone

524
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,300
line of whoever's tracing me and jams

525
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,000
their modem so they can't hung up now

526
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,089
the hunted becomes the hunted you and I

527
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,800
will kill you there's one thing you

528
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,579
should know first

529
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:46,050

530
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,830
