00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,020
bluntly I say 1 to 100 in a second Tom

111
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,120
closes his bedroom door and then he gets

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,620
comfortable and touches his penis

113
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,840
touching his penis is a private thing

114
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
that Tom and Joe is doing Tom knows he

115

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,560
toy manufacturers out there if you have

130
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,780
something that's organic and fluffy

131
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,060
naturally furry you want to turn that

132
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,250
into a plush like this thing this is a

133
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,680
plush this makes sense if you have

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,480
something like a Thomas the Tank Engine

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,600
you never turn this into a plush because

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,680
it's non-organic

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,900
and it's a hard steel metal contraption

138
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,800
thing you turn that into a figure Thomas

139
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,900
the Tank Engine figure or little Roly

140
